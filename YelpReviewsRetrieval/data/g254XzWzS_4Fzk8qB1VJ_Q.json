It definitely wasn't on my \"Places to Eat\" list before arriving in NOLA, but you know how it goes...you intend to spend an hour or two drinking on Bourbon \"just to get a taste of it before moving on\" and next thing you know it's 4 hours later and you're wasted and starving (sound familiar)?So we came here and ordered a large roast beef po' boy to share. And...and...it was really good. Surprisingly good. The bread was soft and fresh, the beef melted in my mouth and the gravy was nicely seasoned.

But I was craving a shrimp po boy and just couldn't find any where else open late at night except the places on Bourbon street catering to the drunk people. So I didn't have high expectations. Then I saw the Shrimp Remoulade Po Boy was cold boiled \"jumbo\" shrimp. I thought ok....maybe a little something different but I really wanted some shrimp. I got it to go, took it to my hotel room. Opened up the plate and found a nice big HAIR IN MY FOOD. Then a piece of shrimp shell. Gross.Gross.Gross.Gross.Way too expensive in the end, and for the price I would have expected some kind of chips better than Lay's.This is like a deli in a grocery store with worse hygiene.Seriously, these are only po boys to drunk people who are so blitzed out of their minds they can't tell up from down.

The day time it's not so crowded. There really is no reason it shouldn't be packed either way. The hot sausage po'boy is good, a little greasy but definitely worth price, and it even comes with chips, which is not like many other places selling po'boys around the area. The menu is almost all po'boy along with some other New Orleans staples. What I like about this place is that the food is made right there but it takes so little time to get. The staff is pretty helpful, counter service is obviously not all the labor intensive but still friendly-especially since I meant one thing but said another and it was changed with no fuss. It's a nice change from the pizza places on Bourbon and definitely a good po'boy place.", "Date": "2009-01-06", "Author_Location": "Astoria, Queens, NY"}, {"Author": "Bruce R.", "ReviewID": "AkB97gN2k4erbaa8KOl9fg", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I rarely give 1's as I prefer to follow the, \"If you can's say something nice . . .\" way of life.

Court Tavern is a medium sized hole-in-the-wall place that probably makes most of it's money serving to drunks. You can tell by the fast service and mediocre quality that most people probably don't critique the food much.- Hole in the wall style- Open kitchen- Fast service- Tasty food, better with beer- Don't expect more than a full belly and satisfied taste buds.Everyone does their jambalaya different and here they offer it with a spicy sausage and soaked rice with chicken mixed and bread on the side. You can get all of this for under $10 and it's serves in a Styrofoam bowl. Classy? Not really. If you wanted classy you'd be sitting at Acme, not here. Fast? Heck yes, and that's the reason I came here, for a quick bite.I didn't expect much for quality but the Jambalaya was pretty good.

I mean, it's New Years Eve 2008, wandering down Bourbon St. with my \"Huge Ass Beer\" and needed a bite to eat. Without sounding TOO MUCH like a tourist, I told my buddy \"Hey, let's try the place with the big ass sign that says 'New Orleans Famous Po' Boy Sandwiches'...\" First of all, the menu is just how I like it: SIMPLE. Check the photo I uploaded. You gotta love a sandwich that not only tastes great but you can measure the greatness of it by how many napkins it takes to keep yourself looking presentable after. (it took me a good 7-8 napkins to look like I knew how to eat like a civil human being) I actually had the combo which consisted of a bowl of Sausage Jambalaya & \u00a0half Po' Boy (roast beef w/gravy) The Jambalaya was great as well, decent amount of spice, plus a couple dashes of Crystal Hot Sauce never hurt anybody...The business was steady throughout our time there and I noticed it got busier as the night went on...If I'm ever back in N'awlins in my lifetime, this will definitely be one of the places I hit up.
