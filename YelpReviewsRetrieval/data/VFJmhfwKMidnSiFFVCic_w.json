Siphon Coffee has all the workings of a great coffee shop, but without the pretentious attitude. We came here twice before, only to be sadly turned down because they closed early during their soft opening. The second time we came the owner (I think) apologized and thanked us for making the journey to the coffee shop. Finally, their regular hours started this week and \u00a0my friends and I could finally try this place. \u00a0We ordered the siphon coffee for two, a blondie brownie, a sea salt chocolate chip cookie, and a cheese and meat plate. \u00a0The coffee was really fragrant \u00a0and delicious. You can tell that the staff knows their coffee. We got the suggestion to let the coffee \"breathe\" for a little bit before consuming. I added a little bit of sugar and milk to my coffee- I don't think it took the flavor of the coffee away at all. The cookie was a little burnt around the edges but still had a pretty good texture, and a good chocolate chip to cookie batter ratio. The blondie was my favorite, sweet, good texture, and a hint of salt. The cheese and meat plate was one of the best I've had. We got a selection of brie (very mellow flavored), Gruyere (so creamy) and blue cheese. We also got prosciutto, salami, and another cured meat that I don't remember what the name was.. we also got pickles, mustard (really good mustard), mixed nuts, and quince jelly. The entire plate came with three long slices of toast, and we could break the toast and put a multitude of toppings to our liking. All of the components of the board complimented each other so there wasn't a wrong combination. I had a toast with mustard, brie and salami. One with gruyere and proscuitto, one with brie and quince jelly, and so on. I definitely recommend this cheese plate - perhaps with a glass of wine than a coffee.

Those two factors alone make Siphon Coffee stand out from most other coffee shops in the area. What makes this place even better is its no-frill, urban appeal. It doesn't try to make the place more hip/artsy/Montrose-y (if you know what I mean)/trendy with its decor. The streamlined set-up consists of furniture of dark-wood tables, leather accent chairs, communal coffee tables and a small side nook with a sofa for lounging with a larger group of friends. Despite the abundance of windows, the openness and the dark interior palette, the place still felt cozy. Need to go back to try their siphoned coffee (was in a hurry) and try out their food, which they noted were all made in-house. Also it's important to note that they only offer natural sugar options. I find that if you want to serve quality coffee, then you should offer quality condiments - none of that Splenda poison you find at other Montrose coffee shops. **Returned 5 days later and realized that the acoustics of the place is awful.

Just a coffee shop. Nothing to separate it from others in the area. It's a blend between a Urban Outfitters (loud music playing in the background, \u00a0with hipster crap strewn about) and a Starbucks... Oh and they served food. Not a place to come study or read, and it seems most people are more concerned about being seen \"working\" on their Macs (as they are constantly looking up to see who's watching them) than actually getting work done. Pros -Lots of parking; Lots of chairs for sitting;Lots of windows and natural lighting;Clean restrooms; Fast service; Outdoor sitting area; Long hours; and ...Coffee is passableCons -Pretentious vibe; Too many hipsters; $$ of coffee and I have to blend it myself!!; and Again not for studying or working.First impressions not sold on this place, but would definitely consider coming back for seconds.", "Date": "2014-06-07", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "A T.", "ReviewID": "3RYTbtSssQtgPgkz3ruuxQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live a block down the street from this place and have been patiently waiting for it to open since the day they put the sign up. Walking in on a Tuesday morning, I had fingers crossed hoping this place would be good and it definitely delivered. Drinks:I had a skim milk latte and it was delicious with nice foam on top. I wish they would add sugar in the raw and simple syrup to their sugar options. Food: I had the breakfast burrito and at only $2.50 I thought it was a pretty good deal. I got the egg and potato one which came in a homemade tortilla w/ green salsa on the side (always bonus when they have green salsa!). I would have liked some bacon added to it but it wasn't an option. It was a little on the salty side for me but still tasty none the less. I also had the chocolate chip and sea salt cookie. Super delicious and would definitely recommend it! Service was a little slow so be ready to wait if you order food. I wasn't in a hurry so I wasn't bothered by it. The staff seemed super friendly which is always nice. They have beer on tap, wine, and a decent looking lunch/ dinner menu. Would love to come back for a glass of wine and cheese plate.", "Date": "2014-05-27", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Vivian M.", "ReviewID": "fbTXZPMucboBT7AciqcqSw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Dropped by on a Saturday morning with family to try out the siphon coffee.

First, the wine was terrible! $7 for tap wine, it was acidic and bitter. The beer tapped out and the guy served it anyway and said come back and I'll give you a free refill since this is all foam (more on this later). The cheese plate arrived, no bread. We asked and the counter guy said they're out of bread. Why would you not disclose this when we ordered? They served us soft cheese, really? \u00a0To spread on what? They ended up bringing some weird butter soaked pita. It was bad. We go back up to get that 'free' beer, he forgot, tried to charge and then when he was reminded, I kid you not, he poured half a glass and didn't blink an eye.

I love good coffeehouses. \u00a0I wanted to give good business to the shop on its opening day so I purchased two breakfasts (even though I was by myself) and it's namesake coffee experience...The Siphon coffee for one. \u00a0I got my card and before the \"brewmaster\" got started, made sure to mention that I liked strong coffee, as I could see other siphon pots filled with a brew that looked more like tea. \u00a0The siphon brewmaster brushed me off with a \"Yeah, this is strong coffee\". \u00a0Ok, I sat down to wait and watch the process. \u00a0Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the coffee, and even more disappointed with the service. \u00a0 I ended up purchasing an espresso adder so I would be able to enjoy my coffee experience. \u00a0I saw the manager circling the shop, but not once did he stop to inquire as to my experience until finally he needed the siphon pot back to serve other customers. \u00a0I seemed to interrupt him when I mentioned I would like to give feedback. \u00a0He then proceeded to shortly tell me the siphon coffee was not for me...contrary to my previous experience which informed me siphon coffee can be brewed to preference. \u00a0This made me want to immediately take back my 20% gratuity which I gave with purchase of my mediocre meal and poor tasting coffee. \u00a0Overall the only two positives about this experience were the location and ambience of the shop itself, and the very nice young man who was working the register and took my order. \u00a0Siphon coffee should hang on tight to this gentleman, as he truly was a gem. \u00a0As for the manager and the siphon brewmaster, several thumbs down. \u00a0I will not be back.", "Date": "2014-05-26", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Noah R.", "ReviewID": "JGjtloQgoGjSajfdWKLtHg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I would really like this place, but the wifi doesn't work.

I rolled into the unlocked coffee shop a little after 8am on Saturday as well as another few people, and the guy who came from the back to greet us, announced they didn't open until 8am. \u00a0(Whaaaat???) \u00a0I checked my watch and looked at the door again, it was 8:05. The couple asked about the fact their yelp page states they open at 7am, he told her that yelp was inaccurate \u00a0and they wouldn't be open till 8am. \u00a0Again, the humor in it overrode being annoyed.

Don't unlock your door. 2. \u00a0Don't have two different opening times on your property 3. Perhaps check your own watch. \u00a0We all laughed it off after we were outside and noticed the guy inside, locked the door and stared at the hours sign for a few minutes before he walked away. \u00a0I know Siphon will be an amazing place.
