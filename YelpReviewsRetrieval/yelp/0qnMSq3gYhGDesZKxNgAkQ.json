It doesn't have a bitter after taste and the smoked flavor and smell is not strong at all. \u00a0It's the right balance. \u00a0Surprisingly, it was my favorite out of everything.Cochon ($28) - it's like eating pork with a crapload of salt. \u00a0Seriously, I don't know if it's only that evening, but the chef was heavy handed on the salt. :/ \u00a0Sheesh. \u00a0It was NOT worth the $28 even if you are a pork lover...and I AM a pork eater. \u00a0You aint' missing much.

The boudin balls weren't anything special. I think I could find them better in a hole in the wall, but still tasty. The Cochon was perfect; diverse textures, balanced flavors and left me wanting more. Omg yum. And the mac n cheese was great, soul warming and satisfying.

Now the cuisine. \u00a0 What did I think? \u00a0Sleek simple flavors, genuine which is \u00a0a \u00a0stark contrast to bold Orleans flavors. \u00a0I am very impressed that there are options other than Emeril's dynasty of restaurants, the Brennan dynasty of restaurants, Arnaud's, Galatoire's, \u00a0Antoine's \u00a0and K-Pauls to savor flavors of the new , \"Southern\" New Orleans. \u00a0Think earthy, savory, spicy yet restrained, distinct and genuine. \u00a0For starters, I had the ribs appetizer because honestly, if the totem for this restaurant is a pig, you bet your mint julep ima get me some porc. \u00a0I had a glass of red Zin with this slightly spicy dish, 3 ribs to an order, enough for 2, 2 going to the pork glutton. \u00a0I was tempted to sin but \u00a0I shared this with two others. \u00a0It was super scrummy, different, with surprising yet awakening flavors of fennel seed \u00a0BBQ spices, vinegar. \u00a0 The spiced melon rind added savory contrast to the vinegar that gave me a lightbulb moment --- why aren't additions like this a standard in our culinary lexicon? \u00a0 \u00a0The ribs were served at room temperature \u00a0which \u00a0threw me off. \u00a0 I expected something hot off the smoker , yet I quickly realized that by serving them at room temp, \u00a0all the flavors and condiments are showcased. \u00a0 \u00a0I tasted a barbecued rib that was so different so clean and spicily yummy from any BBQ i've had. \u00a0I was in heaven.Then the crawfish gumbo. \u00a0Gumbo, how do I love thee? \u00a0 I can have gumbo breakfast lunch and dinner. \u00a0 It was definitely a familiar gumbo but was outstanding in the sense that \u00a0I could taste the crawfish tamale in the sauce.... the umami richness was there yet the aftertaste was seafood and green Earth in a bowl, just to die for. \u00a0 \u00a0If you're a gumbo fan, this can easily be a 2 bowl order but you wanna move on to the next course. \u00a0 Finally, the Main: \u00a0 Louisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage, pickled peaches & cracklins. \u00a0This dish to me was the bomb of bombs. \u00a0If you ever craved a pork on porc stewed, fried, crispy, earthy, cooked low and slow, and sultry all on one plate, this was IT. \u00a0 The almost provincial presentation of the dish reminded me of eating in a small restaurant in the country. \u00a0The glass of Pinot I ordered went super delish with this plate. \u00a0 My brain immediately thought meat lasagne sans noodles, layers of slow cooked meat, with braised vegetables, simple yet profound. \u00a0The very light sauce reminded me that this dish was deceptively cooked for hours to create a complexity of tastes behind simple \u00a0techniques. \u00a0Was a bit stunned. \u00a0To add to the flavor bombs of \u00a0this experience, the dish is topped with a crackling, the crowning glory to the plate that made the most obscene statement to me-- this is a celebration of beautiful PORK from head to tail. \u00a0Dipped the crackling in banana peppers in vinegar (served table side)..... \u00a0Awed, started to laugh, SMH.I \u00a0capped my meal with a shaved Brussels sprouts salad with lemon vinaigrette and Parmesan shavings. \u00a0 Never had raw brussel sprouts. \u00a0The toothy greens with a proper French lemon dressing and a minimal addition of sharp cheese was the lightest of salads I've had in a very very long time. \u00a0 \u00a0Awed, SMH. \u00a0Dining friends agreed, ditto. \u00a0Too full and didn't \u00a0venture on to dessert but will next time. \u00a0 I've always admired the cuisines of New Orleans for nowhere in this great US of A \u00a0is a region steeped in classic French, Creole, Cajun cooking techniques and traditions. \u00a0 The culinary ecosystem is changing in New Orleans. \u00a0 Cochon pioneers \u00a0the \u00a0split from Creole/Cajun/French traditions and reminds us that the changing world of eating in New Orleans is leaning toward simple yet developed, still steeped in multi-cultural gastronomy traditions without forgetting the generational practices of Southern cooking....

There are not many types of foods that I do not enjoy and usually I try to preserve this by using moderation. I don't frequent on particular type of restaurant to others for the type of food being served. I always enjoy restaurants that pay particular attention to quality of the food without distracting us with pretentious environments. Luckily, Cochon compliments my taste in food with my preferred atmosphere.Conchon isn't really hard to find in comparison to a few other nice New Orleans dining options. Remember to look up when looking for the place; the sign is a little subdued (which fits the restaurant style). If you are anywhere near the tourist-populated areas this shouldn't be hard to find. I grabbed a really late lunch around 4 o'clock on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. I stayed for a couple of hours and noticed that there was a wait when we left just before 7PM. I would imagine calling ahead is probably a good idea on busy nights. There is a bar available and tables outside; I would imagine waiting shouldn't be too painful with a drink.The atmosphere is very casual but gives you the impression that it is intentional and not because they didn't have the option to make it less casual. Feel comfortable wearing a T-shirt and something to cover your feet. The atmosphere feels like it encourages you to have a conversation with the person you came with or met there. I think the atmosphere extended our conversation longer that it normally would have been. Expect a trendy talkative environment. I don't have kids but you may be able to get away with it on the weekends if you decided to. (Not sure what kid menu options would be available). The menu selection is appropriate; it a great option for foodies and people who just want something safe to eat. I went with a couple small plate and boucherie options as opposed to ordering entrees. I don't live in New Orleans so really wasn't excited about only trying one item. I ordered the woodfired oysters, chili glazed shrimp, fried boudin, smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle, and a side of the smothered greens. I had an Abita S.O.S. and my fianc\u00e9 had a MollyWop (hilarious name). Everything we had was excellent. I prefer my small plates to come out as each one is prepared because I like it hot. The oysters were still warmed but I want them as soon as they are finished. Please note that the chili glazed shrimp comes with the heads; their actually very good when forked with the body and a lemon circle. Don't forget to try one of the sides, some places don't pay as much attention to the quality of their sides as entrees. Conchon is not one of them, the side of smother greens was exceptional.Service at this place was pretty good. I prefer servers that are accommodating and not intrusive; this place definitely does a great job of walking that line. The price as expected was around $70 for two people. On average that would be about $35 each. Great experience and option if you are looking for New Orleans but open to another take on traditional items.

The secret binder to this dish? \u00a0Mashed potatoes. \u00a0Brilliant!The bread pudding may not be a thing of beauty to look at, but is wonderful for those who like \"soggy\" bread pudding, and a heavy handed bourbon sauce. \u00a0The bread pudding has a great custard and reminds me of super soggy French toast baked with cr\u00e8me brulee.The pineapple upside down cake is deconstructed with a corn meal cake with several strips of pineapple baked into the cake. \u00a0There is a salted caramel sauce with a lime coconut sorbet. \u00a0This is a light and refreshing dessert, and a perfect way to end the meal.Chef Donald Link was nominated for Outstanding Chef 2012 by the James Beard Foundation, for his other restaurant Herbsaint.The price point at Cochon is a steal for the quality of food, execution and taste. \u00a0The dishes are primarily simple, comfort foods but executed with great precision and using great local ingredients.See blog for pics.", "Date": "2014-04-27", "Author_Location": "Chino Hills, CA"}, {"Author": "Lina Z.", "ReviewID": "o4cj7ZVOUBuUNkYBg2R6SA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this place is nice.

I came all the way from Houston, TX to give this restaurant a run for my money and it was worth every mile driven and every dollar spent. Cochon does not seem like your typical cajun/creole restaurant that you would expect to typically find in New Orleans. It has a modern/contemporary feel with a cool hipster flare to it. What I love most about this restaurant is that it is in no way pretentious but you get the same quality food and service as you would in a five star restaurant without the ridiculous price tag. We had two servers who were on point and knew exactly what they were doing. When a server can pay attention to the little things like filling your water before it reaches half full or wiping away any crumbs on the table, you're an A+ in my book.The food of course is incredible! Do yourself a favor and order these dishes. I promise you that you will not regret ordering a single dish and your stomach will be oh-so happy.[+] Wood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter. The sauce on these oysters are literally like liquid crack it is that amazing. Save the complementary bread they give you and use that to mop up every last drop of this liquid gold.[+] Fried alligator with chili garlic mayonnaise. At first I was skeptical but now I'm a firm believer. Don't be fooled when you read the word mayonnaise because it does not taste like it at all. Some say the texture can be a little chewy. To me, it has similar texture to that of chicken fried steak. Delicious, to say the least.[+] Paneed pork cheeks with cauliflower puree & beet relish. The pork cheeks were perfectly charred and crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. I was sad that this was not listed as an entree because I would have definitely devoured the entire plate.[+] Rabbit and dumplings. Comfort food at its finest. The rabbit was so tender it was practically melting in my mouth. The dumplings were soft and dense- a perfect combination for the rich filling. Cochon is definitely a restaurant worth trying.

We tried all the other oyster houses (ACME, Felix, Luke) and this was my favorite for cooked oysters. They had a great smokey flavor and tasted right off the roast.Onion braised pork cheek appetizer - this was a let down. The three bite-sized pieces were very dry. I thought the braising liquid was on the saltier side where MSG was the only pronounced flavor.Rabbit&dumplings - again a let down. The consistency of the dumplings were OK but the actual rabbit stew itself was very mediocre. All I tasted was salt. Maybe New Orleanians are not as sensitive to salt but you could not taste any of the ingrediants - there were clearly carrots, celery and pieces of rabbit but they all were consumed by the salty viscous 'stew'...Louisiana Cochon - this was good. Tasty au jus poured over stewed pork topped with cracklins surrounded by pickled turnips. The stewed pork was a bit dry but the turnips and cracklins (which melted in your mouth) made up for it.The service was poor - we saw our waiter once, he failed to give us the specials and told us there was no bread left all the while the table next to us just got bread from a different waiter.

I didn't really enjoy that and I made a point to take my time through my meal.Started with the Wood Fired Oysters w/ Chili Garlic Butter ($12), which was so good that I was scraping the shells with my fork trying to get the burnt deliciousness that was still on the shell. \u00a0Next was the Smoked Pork Ribs w/ Watermelon Pickle ($12), which was again delicious and different. The watermelon pickle was the perfect compliment to the sauce of on the pork ribs. \u00a0Since I was at a food castle of New Orleans, I decided that I needed to continue trying some foods that I've tried or enjoyed so some brussel sprouts came to the table. I have to admit they weren't my favorite dish all night and I probably wouldn't order them again, but since I don't like brussel sprouts, these were good enough that I didn't mind eating them. \u00a0That's a big statement to eat something that you don't enjoy normally? \u00a0Finally the Oven Roasted Gulf Fish \"Fisherman Style\" ($28) was the perfect finish to an unbelievable meal.If you're in Cochon, you better be drinking and I greatly, highly, must suggest that you try The Rub. It's insane. Rye + apple cider vinegar + bitters + simple syrup. It's such an odd pairing with the vinegar, but it's soooooo unbelievable. It's one of the best mixed drinks that I've ever had in my life. It was so good that it got it's own paragraph in the review.As an all around restaurant, Cochon really hit my man spot perfectly. From the lay-out of the restaurant, the slightly open kitchen, the wood, the drinks, the food, the seats to the table set-up. Everything hit perfectly. When you come to a place that is setting the standard for new cuisine in such a big city, you understand why it's been on must go lists and television shows. Do yourself a favor.

Here's what I'll say about the food at Cochon; It's edible. It wasn't amazing. It wasn't even especially memorable. It was mediocre at its best. The oysters and the bread were the highlight of the meal. I wouldn't say don't eat here but I will say that there are many other restaurants in the city that will give you better food for your buck.

The experience was horrible and I regret suggesting this place! None of us (10 people) will be back. 1. We walked in to an empty restaurant (maybe 4 tables were occupied) and were told by the hostess we couldn't be seated until our full party arrived. So instead of sitting, we all stood around OUR table crowding the walkway until everyone showed up.2. We ordered 2 bean pies and 2 orders of oysters to start and only 1 bean pie was delivered (the second was delivered 15 minutes later because the waiter \"dropped the original one\"). So 10 of us had to share crumbs of the first bean pie and by the time the second came nobody wanted it. By the way the bean pie is gross. Oysters were okay.3. Every single person at the table received their entr\u00e9e except me (I was the only one to order fish). Out of respect everyone was waiting for me to get my meal, but eventually had to just go ahead and eat because it took over 10 minutes to deliver my meal (we all assume he forgot to put the order in). The waiter compted me a shot of moonshine but that still didn't make up for ruining our meal. 4. Our boss asked for some horse radish for his pork and was literally told, \"there is more than enough already on the table, you can share\". I am not kidding!!!! We all had a good laugh after that because what else can you do after being spoken to like a child when you are paying for a $400 meal. Maybe my problem was primarily with the waiters we had but the whole place wreaks of poor customer service and unfriendly faces. Our entire Christmas party consisted of, \"did we get what we ordered?\" \"when will we get refills?\" \"did they deliver your meal yet?\". It was horrible and not fun at all.

The rabbit was tender so, it was pretty good but it's not a dish that I'll order again because the rabbit taste like chicken anyway. The dumpling were more like a biscuit than dumpling so that was quite a confusion for us too when we were looking for the 'dumpling'. 4.

I mean, I could not believe how good this was. I should have gotten another one.I sampled some of my friend's smoked brisket which was really good.I had the rabbit and dumplings. I think dumplings should be in quotes. It's more like biscuits sitting in gravy--top is exposed and slightly crusty, not a typical dumpling. I'm not complaining though. They were still good! There were 4 of these small little delights. Rabbit was well cooked. The gravy that the rabbit and dumplings was bathed in was fantastic! I would take a bath in this and just slurp it up to drain the tub. It was that good. Man. This dish was great. Get it.So again, no service issues with the bartender.

The day before I finally went there but left feeling unimpressed. That experience filled me with certain doubts when I went to this restaurant this afternoon. Boy was I surprised! The wood fired oyster was so good I had to order one more plate. It is served on a bed of rock salts and the oysters are juicy and full of flavor. I normally prefer fresh raw oysters with little \u00a0spice added, but now I'm a convert. I will choose these cooked oysters over any raw ones without blinking. The fried alligator is very good too. The breading does not override all the flavor and preserves the unique texture of the meat quite well. Eat each piece with the fresh mint leave provided and you will enjoy a quite complex taste unlike typical fried stuff. The fisherman style fish is a masterpiece as well!All in all, this is one of the few truly memorable dining experiences I've had in my life. It has been a few hours and I'm still in food coma.

Made a reservation online, only a couple of days in advance, and overall had a good experience. Let me break it down for you.Initially got seated right next to the communal table, which was taken over by a bachelor party of about 15, loud, obnoxious males. Sorry guys, but really? Go somewhere on Bourbon street. Pretty sure you ruined the dining experience of every customer in the restaurant, as it is not an exceptionally large place. Other tables were open, so we asked our waitress if we could move tables, since I couldn't hear my friend speaking across from me. The manager came over to us immediately, apologized, and reseated us. He was very sweet, and apologized for the loud group.We were lucky to have the chance to erase that first impression and start over. Our waiter was WONDERFUL. Young, cool, informed, friendly, fast but not rushing. We ordered a bottle of wine, and started with some apps and split an entree.1. Wood-fired oysters with chili garlic butter (app) -- HOLY WOW! So delicious. If you like oysters, this is a must-order.2. Smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickles (app) -- I mean, the place is called \"Pork\" in French, so ordering it off the menu is a must. The pickles were such a nice touch! The ribs fell right off the bone, so you didn't even have to get down and dirty if you didn't want to. Would definitely order again.3. Shaved zucchini salad and toasted pecan salad (app) -- Needed to order some sort of veggie to balance out everything else. The zucchini was so good! Something different, and the flavors blended seamlessly.4. Smothered pork loin with apples and caramelized onions (entree) -- It was alright. Took a bit to come out of the kitchen, and because of that was a little over-cooked. Our waiter did apologize, and made up for it with 2 shots of cat-daddy moonshine when he brought us the check. Wouldn't order that entree again, but had it been cooked better (and not forgotten...) it would have been delicious! The caramelized onions with the apples was an interesting yet tasty combination.All in all, we had a great experience. Despite the couple of speed-bumps (stupid, fratty bachelor party boys and the over-cooked entree), the wait staff made up for it both times, which made me feel a lot more comfortable.

The fluffy homemade buns they brought out didn't hurt either. I really enjoy an aesthetically pleasing yet functional restaurant, and Cochon nails it with great textures, lots of blocky wood and an open kitchen.I will say though if you have any sort of anxiety about sitting on one of those communal booth benches with two seaters arranged fairly close, this might not be your stop sans reservations on a Friday night. \u00a0Monday summer lunch was pretty slow, crowd-wise, to what I've seen in the past. We ordered two appetizers, the louisiana blue crab with buttermilk & chive dressing served in an cleaned out crab shell and fried boudin with pickled peppers. Our waiter also brought out the pork cheeks with baby limas, mushrooms & peach relish compliments of the chef, though I think he was just sweet on my coworker. Either way, the pork cheeks were phenomenal and I could've eaten a boat filled with the crab dressing. The boudin served with a grainy creole mustard wasn't necessarily my bag. I would say if you're trying boudin for the first time, see if you can get it in sausage form 'cause fried doesn't do this Cajun staple justice. I ordered the special, and it was pretty tasty and cooked very well.I like that the food came out fast despite it being slow in the restaurant since I've found many New Orleans restaurants tend to be slower getting food out when it's not busy. \u00a0I know I didn't foot the bill, but the entrees on the menu are a little pricey for lunch, though the special was in considerable range for the quality.

Great servers were very helpful in explaining the food!Cochon has a relaxing, casual atmosphere, with lots of nice wooden tables, and eclectic music.I enjoyed my rabbit and dumplings so much that, at the end of our 3-night trip to Nola, I almost returned to Cochon for a second meal! But in New Orleans, there are SO many wonderful places to tempt a hungry yelper! Cochon is one of the best, and while it's not cheap, it's also less expensive than dinner at K-Paul's Louisiana Cafe.

No.But that's because it doesn't want to be great; what it it wants instead is simply to be really good.(which it is).This is an important distinction to make in the for-profit culinary world: sometimes you can be too good - too attentive to details, too obsessed with control, too worried about the seasonality and freshness of your ingredients. And then it becomes hard to a run a restaurant as a business, which is after all what they are.Because if you want to be great, it takes more than talent. To be great, the prices of your ingredients rise, the number of covers you can turn around in any given night drops to the edge of profitability, and you cut things like lunches and brunches to focus instead on evening service with a small kitchen staff and experimental dishes that some patrons will find, well, too adventurous for their palates and pocketbooks.When such places persist long enough to become profitable (which usually takes years and lots on investor patience), then they become \"great.\" They survive because of gastronomers and people with money to spare on food as art. A Michelin star - not mention great Yelp reviews - certainly can help.Couchin does not aspire to greatness, imo. But it chooses the next best thing: they created a menu and setting with enough space for foodies and for more casual eaters-out, from 20-something couples to families with children to college students on break to conventioneers out for some fun, food, and libations after a long day of sessions and organizing.You can definitely get a good and healthful meal here if you order right and avoid the heavy hitters (like the fried gator parts or pork-based sausages).Start with a really good wine, in the $30-50 range; a Kermit Lynch selection - 2010 Ch\u00e2teau de Lascaux Languedoc-Roussillon red (Syrah/Grenache/Mourvedre) at $42 hit the mark for us;Order a plate of oven-roasted oysters as starter; add some of the house sweet potato habanero sauce if you'd like (it goes great on the brioche style bread, too).Soups and salads are nicely thought out. The kale and beet salad with deviled eggs and a basic vinaigrette was nice, as was a cream of broccoli option. Perfect winter fare.For mains, you'd be hard pressed to do better than the oven-roasted Gulf fish, served as a fillet skin-side down with lemon, pickled onion, and parsley on the side; and the rabbit and dumplings, served in a root vegetable and potato stew in a single-serve cast iron skillet.All that for about $115 (2/3 for the food), and when you add it all up, it's a really good meal.Not Craigie on Main great.

The roving commitment-phobes of the food world, always looking over the menu to see what we're missing, afraid to order the same thing twice.But our hearts are, if we're honest, often most at home in just one place, in the one food world or dish or venue where we know everything is right and honest and uncomplicated and just so good. For me, that world is the vast one of Southern foodways, currently under rediscovery by many who maybe didn't know until just now about Edna Lewis or kale or salt pork or Husk or grits or biscuits or anything. Oh, what they've missed.And what I missed, from my years living in the South, was this, the food, the place with such a vastly rich culinary history and such tiny and fascinating microclimates of cuisine. So lovely to find, then, a home in Cochon, and the genius of Donald Link. But to find them so perfectly, and in ways reinvented such that both my faithless palate and faithful heart were so satisfied that I kept stopping during the meal as I couldn't remember just where in the world I was. West Coast? The South? Home? Far away? New? Old? Not sure. Take the Catdaddy Carolina Moonshine. (We did, since it was on the house for my dear birthday girl.) I've had some in my day, usually out of a glass jar passed around late at night at some music festival. But this was like drinking Christmas, with some vanilla nutmeg infusion all smooth and sweet and spicy so that my slowness in finishing it had everything to do with desperately not wanting to finish the last drop while at the same time anxiously awaiting the next. (Cochon is credited with putting some muscle and energy into the small-but-growing Southern moonshine industry for the needs of their bar program.)Or take the pineapple upside down cake, all tiny on the plate and crumbly with cornmeal to add just the right bit of savory. Or any combination of pork, beans, and greens all fancied up in different ways and variations but everything perfectly spiced, fresh to the bite, and just-fancier than I'd make it at home...so it's worth flying across the country for. I wanted one of everything on the menu, not because I was afraid of missing anything lovely (okay, there WAS that), but more because every plate looked like a welcome-back.

The Cochon was very rich. The pickled turnips did not help at all. Literally everyone on Yelp suggested the Alligator but to be honest, you can get alligator anywhere down there y'all!

About Cochon I wanna say something including, \"All the best from land, swamp and sea.\" And that's probably just cause I wanna mention swamp... and that's just cause I feel need to mention the alligator, just like everyone else. Really though, that super light and crispy, almost tempura-like, batter-fried alligator with a bright orange, chile-garlic aioli is easily the best alligator I've had. Not to front like I'm a constant alligator-eatin' thing of a person, but I've eaten preparations here and there in my time, and Cochon's unique version is by far is my favorite. It's a completely delicious appetizer. I also love the wood fired oysters as a starter; perfectly cooked and well-seasoned, juicy juicy. We've enjoyed those before but with a name like Cochon, the pig has to be good. Or it should be as it'd be a cryin shame otherwise. It is great, so have no fear. They know what they're doin. \u00a0They cure and smoke their own meats and sausages.The boucherie section of the menu is fantastic. The Boucherie Plate of beautiful charcuterie is just excellent. The fried boudin with pickled peppers are great too. The exterior of the boudin balls are fried to a breaded crunch, while the pork and rice insides were so soft and savory. The brininess of the pickled peppers and the creole mustard accented the whole t'do perfectly. The smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle have been tasty, tasty business as well. How many people have noted that you can go, \"Hog wild,\" here? Add me that number, cause you can. It's punny but it's true.And I'm not even done listing pork dishes. The Louisiana Cochon? My husband ordered it as his main course this time. Slow-cooked pork is formed into a golden crusty succulence, in the shape of a hockey puck. Served with turnips, cabbage, cracklins and pickled peaches, it is just killa. Delicious.Really, a couplea pals could \u00a0easily make a great meal out of a selection of the small plates here, and it is a great plan, and one that I'd most likely stick to in the future. It's just that I now know about the rabbit and dumplings too... Served up in a cast iron pan was some tender, shredded rabbit in some glorious pot-pie style gravy and topped with perfect dumplings for the sopping. Well, clearly that was cozy. Damn, that entree was delicious. Lip-smacking, even. I use that term quite literally as I repeated during a recent dinner there, \"This is lip-smacking, I'm literally smacking my lips right now.\" After blurting that out, I made a myself a mental note: Make sure you mention that. The food at Cochon is great in that it hits on an universal soul food level which is basically my attempt at labeling the feeling of instant recognition that happens when enjoying a real true comfort-food moment. The dishes we've shared here have been a delicious synthesis of \u00a0Southern and authentic Cajun cuisine with a heightened touch of modernization and sophistication. All washed down with a pitcher of Abita. Nice ya can get a pitcher. I feel the need to mention that I appreciated being able to enjoy a nice cold pitcher with our wholehearted feasting.In fact, that's the overall vibe of this place, to me, more than anything: Feasting. Passing plates and plates around, geekin on how good. It's true that the rustic-meets-modern warehouse of a restaurant feels more than a little trendy too, but moreso, it's abuzz with what feels like the shared energy of mass enjoyment of good meals. \u00a0Of course I can only speak for my man and myself, but enjoy, we certainly did.

What? I haven't written a review on Cochon yet? Well let's see if I can remember my fantastic experience from a couple of months ago.A professor from my alma mater was in town for some research and offered to take me to dinner. Someone had told him that he should try Cochon and I hadn't been there yet so I gladly agreed.Let's see... I think we started out with Smoked Pork Ribs with Watermelon Pickle, the Mushroom Salad with Deep Fried Beef Jerky and Lemon Vinaigrette, and something else... I can't remember the third one. But everything was tasty. I wasn't thrilled about ordering the mushroom salad, but it was very good. The citrus in the vinaigrette went perfectly with the mushroom and the beef jerky was a very nice touch.For my main dish I got the cochon de lait, which was served with cracklins. The cracklins were fun but in retrospect they were nothing compared to the fresh cracklins I tried in Lafayette... But the cochon de lait was very good.

After stopping by the convention center we wanted some great food to make the run the next morning worth it. One of my friends had heard about Cochon. While we weren't able to get a reservation (it was a Saturday night after all), we were able to walk in as it was just before 5p. Hey - we were going to be running a half marathon in the morning - we needed sleep.First up, the atmosphere was just the right mix of casual and class. While I definitely felt odd wearing a hat (I'd flown in that morning (and boy were my arms tired)) and was still in my travel outfit, I didn't feel that out of place. This is definitely not a \"jacket required\" place.We had a conversation with the waiter who introduced us to the menu and the specials. We ordered cocktails and reviewed the menu to figure out our plan of attack.There were many, many dishes that found their way onto the table. Here's everything that I remember:Gumbo (my appetizer) - By far this was the best gumbo I'd ever had. It was a chicken and deviled egg gumbo. Now, I'd never seen a deviled egg in gumbo, but who am I to judge. The color was a wonderful dark reddish-brown. The flavor was amazing, with just the right amount of spice. It's the kind of gumbo I'd love to be able to recreate at my house.The broiled drum special (my entree) - An amazing piece of fish. Seasoned remarkably well. Just delicious.Fried alligator - Can't go wrong with fried alligator, and this certainly didn't disappoint.The oysters - OK, let's get make something perfectly clear - I don't like oysters. Can't stand them. I hate oysters. *These* oysters, however - these oysters I love. If all oysters were like this then I'd be on board. Loved the spice of the sauce they were doused with. The oysters themselves had a very nice flavor as well. All I can say is \"wow\".The couple of cocktails we had were good but unfortunately unremarkable. But that was the only complaint we had. Out of the 4 of us (and the 9 dishes that found their way to the table), that was the only complaint. Everyone loved their food.

Just without the pig!On the day we arrived in New Orleans, we felt that we should take an opportunity to try some of the finest places that the city had to offer. In a jet lagged, exhausted daze, we deferred our judgement to Yelp and found that Cochon was just a few minute walk from our hotel. We were starving and Yelp warned us that there may be a line, but we decided to give it a shot anyway. We lucked out and were seated pretty quickly. Just 15 minutes later, the place began to fill up and it looked like most people had to wait at least an hour. If you have the opportunity, I'd highly recommend making a reservation. You might not be as lucky as we were!We started the evening off with a couple of cocktails and an order off the deep fried alligator. The name of my cocktail is escaping me, but it was made with cinnamon syrup, brandy, whiskey, and orange bitters. It was mind-bogglingly good. I had to savor it or else it would disappear too quickly, but the complexity was absolutely amazing. The cinnamon was prominent, but not overbearing. I could easily down about 6 or 7 of these bad boys.As most people have stated below, the deep fried gator is a star. It's young and tender, and the crust is crispy and not too greasy. The chili aioli that it's smothered in packs quite a punch, but holy god is it bangin'. For the main entree, I went with the rabbit and dumplings. While it wasn't quite as amazing as the gator, it was still very delicious. I think i would have enjoyed it a lot more had it not been 1000 degrees outside because it was incredibly heavy. Maybe I'll go back at Christmas time and give it another shot. The girlfriend went with the pork belly and, while I can't eat it myself, she didn't make a peep during the entire dinner (other than a few moans).The chocolate peanut butter pie that we ordered for dessert was on a whole 'nother level of gluttony.

We didn't make a reservation because I didn't think I would need one at 4:00 on a Thursday. There was one other table occupied when we arrived and two more groups arrived while we were eating.

He brought me a beer and slammed it down so hard on the table that it foamed over. He slammed all of our plates down on the table and caused the watermelon relish on the ribs to splatter all over my white shirt. He did all of this without saying a word.

I tried some of the bacon and oyster sandwich and found that to be less salty than the cochon. My friends who tried my dish agreed.

On the recommendation of my daughter, who has friends that work at Cochon, our entire meal consisted of appetizers, salad and small plates, so I can't comment on entrees.Pork cheeks and mushrooms over a bed of grits? Decadent and worthwhile of an entree version, since I could have lost myself in it. Fried alligator with a chili aioli? 3 stars, just because alligator tends to taste like whatever you might coat it in. But, since I was with an out of towner that never had alligator before, it was a must.Mixed salad with peanut vinaigrette? I wasn't sure how I would like it, but it was refreshing and quirky.Louisiana Cochon? What can go wrong with pulled pork that is formed into a patty and crisped, served over a bed of turnips and cabbage and topped with peaches? Not a single thing. I don't even like turnips - or at least I didn't until today. I wish there had been more peaches or larger pieces of peaches, but that would just be nitpicking.Dessert? The banana pudding was glorious and my dining companion said he is going back tonight just to have it again before leaving town. The apple crumb cake with cheddar cheese ice cream was the only disappointment. The cake was wonderful, but I just couldn't get past the sharpness of the ice cream. We scooted it off to the side and enjoyed the cake with the general consensus being that sometimes less is more and a plain old vanilla bean ice cream would have been a perfect topping.Reasonable wine, tangy mimosas and coffee that's as strong as I make at home.There's nothing not to like about this place except for the fact that it's a bit expensive to make it a regular dining spot.

For the appetizers we ordered the fried alligator, chargrilled oysters with chili garlic sauce, stuffed artichoke with crab, a sideof mac and cheese, and the fried livers on toast. The appetizers were probably the best part of the meal and we were fans of all the dishes except the stuffed artichoke due to the toughness of the artichoke leaves.

For the main dishes we ordered the cochon which is similar to a fried pulled pork patty over cabbage, rabbit and dumplings and the braised pork cheeks. Personally, I liked the rabbit and dumplings best because the cochon was a little too salty for us and the braised pork cheeks were just okay.Overall, the food was good and very rich, which made it difficult to eat as much as I wanted.

While you are at it, why don't you try the fried pigs ears with cane syrup mustard, and the paneed pork cheeks with peanuts?I had to try a couple of cocktails after reading their specialty cocktail list. Started with The Boss Hog - Jr. Johnson's midnight moon Carolina Moonshine, cucumber vodka, fresh watermelon juice, and limeade. Summer was served in a cocktail glass. I then moved on to Catahoula Hound Dog \u00a0- Citadell gin, lemon bitters, homemade blueberry syrup, and muddled lime. Summer came again, this time in my pants (oops, excuse me!). They also have five kinds of root beer, 15 Bourbons, and a variety of beers. I wanted to try everything on the menu. However, I left my spare stomach at home, so I had to settle for only a few items. Started off with the fried rabbit livers. Deep fried rabbit livers served on toast smeared with pepper jelly. Utterly divine! This set the stage for a great meal to follow.I then ordered the wood fired oysters. Oysters on the half shell roasted in a wood even, sprinkled with a spicy (chilli?) oil. Good lord! Perfect blend of the oyster saltiness with spiciness of the sprinkled oil. At this point I decided to forgo entrees and order more appetizers. My dining companions ordered different items from the entree list. Next orders for me were the fried alligator and tomato stuffed with crab. Tossed in chili garlic aioli, the fried alligator was consumed in about 2 minutes flat. Scrumptious! The crab stuffed tomato - half a beefsteak tomato stuffed with crabmeat, drizzled with garlic pullman and roasted in a wood oven. Simple yet delectable. Two of my dining companions ordered the famous rabbit with dumplings. It is served in a cast iron pan. Hearty and filling, this is a must for any rabbit meat lover.

The prices are not the cheapest for lunch (b/c they basically use the dinner menu all day), but the food is delicious! I didn't mind a little splurge, all things considered.First thing's first: THE ROLLS. Oh my Lord, the rolls! Imagine the little ready-to-bake dinner rolls your mother made you when you were a kid (only in my mother's case, they were the rolls she used to BURN for me when I was a kid) . . . now imagine they are NOT the cheap & dirty variety, and that they are really squishy and doughy. Can you say CRACK? I couldn't, because my mouth was full.Our server was precious (and just my type . . . tall and fuzzy! He got a good tip for being eye candy). I knew I wanted to order the poached yard egg with roasted mushrooms & grits, but when I asked the cute little server if that would be enough, he said a side of macaroni & cheese casserole would probably be a good idea. So I went with that.The poached egg with roasted mushrooms & grits = UH-MAZING. My only complaint is that they literally drowned it in green onions, and not being an onion fan at all, I had to spend a great deal of time picking them off with my fork (I just couldn't handle it . . . there were so many! It was embarrassing, but yes, I'm that picky. To a debilitating degree.). Once I got the green onion situation under control, the dish was decadent and delicious. That yolk was bright yelllow and pretty runny, which is fine with me. I'm sure they would customize that if you like a firmer yolk, but you would have to specify.

New Orleans is a dynamite food city, but it's not exactly a vegetarian's paradise. Throughout the weekend, his diet consisted of red beans and rice, beignets, burritos and Subway...but his best meal undoubtedly came at a placed named for pig. \u00a0That exemplifies the food generally at Cochon--everything whether meat or veg was locally inspired, unique, and delicious.At first I was a little skeptical b/c the place looked and felt trendy. It was packed on a saturday night and there was a pretty lively bar scene. Locals, families, young professionals, southern belles and bobs, and our merry group of 9 made up for a pretty diverse clientele, and we all enjoyed Cochon's equally diverse drink list. Then my skepticism quickly disappeared once the food started arriving.It all started with one of the greatest dinner rolls I've ever had the pleasure to begin a meal with--these warm, soft, pillowy, and complimentary clouds were literally glistening, and our group of nine went through at least 5 baskets worth. Then came our appetizers: first, fried gator with chili garlic aioli. \u00a0In all my life, I had never tasted gator and then one weekend in NOLA and I had it twice. Cochon's version was similar to a rock shrimp tempura with chili mayo appetizer that you'd find in a lot of japanese restaurants...except that gator doesn't taste like shrimp but a combination of frog and chicken. The gator was fried crispy and there was a good enough chunk of meat--a perfect balance of familiarity and exotic meat. The onion and grit casserole was really creamy but my veg friend could probably tell you more as he wolfed most of it down. Also, we got our first taste of \"cochon\" through the fried boudin balls. These had the size and appearance of falafel, and were meaty and starchy at the same time as they had a flavorful combo of what i think was sausage and rice. Finally came the piece de resistance: Louisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage and cracklins. The way our waitress described it, the cochon was pulled pork that was shaped together, seared and pan fried to create a crispy texture on the outside. \u00a0To me, it was a hockey puck full of juicy, crispy, succulent strands of pork. The accompanying turnips and cabbage livened up the dish and provided me with my only serving of vegetable that day. But the pork, combined with perfectly crunchy cracklins (is there any better word for food than cracklin?) clearly took home the bacon: an inspired signature dish for an amazing restaurant devoted to pig.

The fried rabbit liver with pepper jelly was beyond awesome and I nearly ordered another plate of it immediately after the first bite. \u00a0The fried boudin balls were good, though I preferred the ones we had at lunch at Boucherie more. \u00a0The Louisiana pork was mildly disappointing - I'd had better pulled pork many times before at 1/4 the price and our cracklins were missing the crack and were kind of flabby. \u00a0My wife loves mac and cheese and all three of us really loved the pancetta-studded version at Butcher, so we figured it would be a no brainer here. \u00a0Nope, as it turns out, not great.Dessert was further down the scale still. \u00a0The hummingbird cake was dry and rather unpleasant. \u00a0The pineapple upside-down cake was pretty unremarkable and pairing it with a lime sorbet emphasized all the wrong notes of the dulce and the pineapple.And then there was the service, which was uniformly bad. \u00a0I called from the hotel to let them know that we'd be a few minutes late. \u00a0\"No promises,\" the front of house said. \u00a0\"Our reservations are full tonight.\" \u00a0So we scooped up my sleeping daughter into the stroller and started running. \u00a0As the time for the reservation crept closer and we hadn't yet arrived, my wife told me to run on ahead. \u00a0I was glad to see lots of people out walking on Tchoupitoulas or I wouldn't have really dared.I arrived, on the verge of out of breath, to find a restaurant that wasn't half full. \u00a0Now, had I called and said \"we're going to be an hour late,\" I would get making a point of not intending to hold our reservation on a Friday night. \u00a0But by the time we finished eating, the restaurant still wasn't even approaching full. \u00a0I'd fully explained that I had a sleeping kid that was possibly going to make us late. \u00a0Why not cut us some slack?Our server started out charming and ended up absent. \u00a0He walked us through the menu and made a few recommendations, and the food got out to us in short order. \u00a0When it came time to get a check, though, he disappeared for 45 minutes. \u00a0My poor daughter, 30 minutes short on her nap (my fault) and having put on her party manners at some fairly upscale establishments over the past week, absolutely lost it about ten minutes into that 30 and my wife left to return to the hotel for her. \u00a0I watched our server flit around the room, taking drink orders and flirting with the ladies for the rest of the 20 minutes before he returned with the ARE YOU KIDDING DID WE REALLY SPEND THAT MUCH check. \u00a0I'm not one to often tip below 20%, but between the reservation static and making me wait so that he could run up people's bar tabs, I was feeling punitive.This was our last night in NOLA. \u00a0Earlier in the trip, I'd almost bought a shirt at Butcher but figured, since Cochon was around the corner, that I'd return and grab it after we ate. \u00a0Sadly, the Cochon experience colored Butcher enough that I left without the shirt. \u00a0I'll skip Cochon next time and camp at Butcher instead for half the price and better food.", "Date": "2012-02-08", "Author_Location": "Salt Lake City, UT"}, {"Author": "Linden G.", "ReviewID": "qpjyWl8vdJRmizemUrorRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If I was to only visit one restaurant in New Orleans, it would be Cochon.And if I had one regret from my recent trip to NOLA, it would be that we left Cochon to our last night.You see, New Orleans is a food city. It's impossible to visit and not eat well and copiously. And that we did. So much so that by our final dinner at Cochon, I was unable to try everything on the menu that I wanted to.The Angelenos out there will understand when I say Cochon is like the Animal of the south. A celebration of not only the pig, but of all things meat. For the rest of you, Cochon is Chef Donald Link and Chef Stephen Stryjewski's modern Cajun restaurant that has been the buzz of New Orleans in recent years. Housed in a converted warehouse in the Warehouse District, the contemporary-rustic space is all handcrafted wooden tables and chairs, exposed brick and concrete floors. It boasts an in-house boucherie, Cochon Butcher, that turns whole pigs into boudin, andouille, smoked bacon, and head cheese, and a wood burning oven turning out roasted oysters, beef brisket and suckling pig. Rounding out the produce are locally caught seafood and regional bourbons and beers.Need more convincing? How about the 2007 James Beard award for Best Chef: South for Donald Link and Best New Restaurant nomination for Cochon? How about oyster and meat pie, fried rabbit livers with pepper jelly toast, wood-fired oyster roast, fried alligator with chili garlic aioli, fried boudin with pickled peppers, spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle, fried pigs ears with cane syrup mustard, paneed pork cheeks with pickled green tomatoes?Choosing only five plates from the menu is like walking into a brothel with only 50 bucks. An exercise in frustration.But a mouth watering frustration, nonetheless.Choose we did. We started with the oyster and meat pie and the arugula salad with pumpkin calas, pecan and tasso bacon. The oyster and meat pie was more what I'd think of as a pasty than a pie but, semantics aside, it was good. The baked shell had a good crunch and the filling, although not strong on the flavor of oyster, was satisfyingly meaty. A great snack with a beer.Which, luckily, I had on hand. Lazy Magnolia's Indian Summer Spiced Ale. The orange and coriander notes were pronounced, making it quite a floral beer. I have to look out for this in LA. Delicious.I conceded one dish to a salad for the girl. The aforementioned arugula salad with pumpkin calas, pecan and tasso bacon. I let her eat the arugula. I ate the deep fried pumpkin fritters. I like to compromise.Next up was the fried alligator with chili garlic aioli. The last time I had alligator was in a Vietnamese restaurant and it was heavily sauced. I don't think I'd ever had a true taste of alligator. I can report back that it tastes like chewy pork. Still, it's hard to go wrong with even deep fried chewy pork with a sweet chili garlic sauce.We followed that with, unsurprisingly, more deep fried meat. The fried rabbit livers with pepper jelly toast. Now, I'm a big fan of liver, mainly in the form of chicken livers, duck livers and, of course, foie gras. These rabbit livers were far more mild in taste than chicken or duck livers. Dressed with onion and cilantro and served on a thin slice of crispy pastry-like toast with a sweet pepper jelly, this was my favorite plate of the night. Again, a great interplay of fried crunch, gamey flavors and a sweet sauce.We rounded out our small tasting with the paneed pork cheeks with pickled green tomatoes, apples and peas. Tender, as expected, and lightly breaded and pan fried. The pickled green tomatoes and apples added tartness, the peas and rice the cheeks sat on the starch. The most substantial of the small plates we ordered, and perhaps the most complete dish.Unfortunately we left no room for dessert but the pineapple upside down cornmeal cake with coconut-lime sorbet and dulce de leche sounded tempting. Next time.Besides, the night was still young (well, by New Orleans standards) and we had more adventures planned for our final night.More local delicacies to sample.Now, where was that 50 bucks?", "Date": "2010-09-03", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Chris L.", "ReviewID": "b7eJJdspVdbzZ3-IWKjbGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wowser---this WAS the best meal I've had in New Orleans, but also the most expensive. \u00a0I had the LA Cochon, mac & cheese, & a draft Abita rootbeer for $40 (with tip).It's magical. \u00a0It really is, from the crispy & fatty cracklin' to the tang of turnips & cabbage. \u00a0Simple presentation, but a homerun delivery of flavors.They got moonshine on the menu too! \u00a0I didn't see it on the initial menu, so I didn't bother to ask about it. \u00a0Don't make the same mistake I did!", "Date": "2009-01-21", "Author_Location": "Sachse, TX"}, {"Author": "Jeff S.", "ReviewID": "sUJSUIzVZShREV8QowXgZg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Another visit, and still my favorite dining experience in the city...none of the problems other reviewers had...we did our Mothers Day meal on Monday, since I hate crowds at restaurants.

So when I knew I was coming out to New Orleans, this restaurant became a top priority.I'm so glad I ate here.Our first meal, however, was not pork. It was fried alligator with chili-garlic aioli. I've had alligator before, and it wavers between delicious and rubber. This night's alligator was firmly in the middle. The sauce was spectacular, though, despite the overly chewy (even for gator) nature of the dish.The second dish was healthier, as I wanted something fresh to counteract the utter destruction of my body that was to follow. To my delight, the dish, cucumbers with herbs and vinegar, was simple, refreshing and sublime. Next came our first pork venture, barbecue ribs with watermelon pickles. What else can I say? Perfection. Great sauce, the rib meat was falling off the bone, and the pickles added a sweet and sour kick to the already tangy and sweet barbeque sauce. A winner.Next, deep fried boudin with fresh mustard and hot peppers. Boudin already rocks on its own, so to deep fry those suckers is to create one of the most delicious plates I've had in awhile. Pure awesomeness.The next dish was ham hocks with sweet potato, pickled greens and black eyed peas. The ham hocks came in their own jus, which made me happy. The flavors were really beyond description, a truly perfect blend of sweet, salty, and sour - all my favorite things, especially with pork.And then came the namesake dish of the restaurant - cochon with cracklins and turnips. Juicy and delicious, it truly knocked my socks off.

It consisted of more white meat than I expected. The chili garlic sauce gave it a spicy, Asian twist. I'm glad I tried it once, but I probably won't order it again.

My concern with dining by myself at a restaurant with so many tasty looking menu items is that one has limited stomach space (and, at least for me, purchasing power), and can only sample, at most, a few items. By a stroke of amazing luck, however, I was seated next to three friendly nurses from Texas, and we ended up sharing plates across the 4 of us for the duration of the meal.Between the 4 of us, we sampled nearly everything on the menu. Service was prompt and attentive, and all of the food was perfectly executed. I could have happily eaten plate after plate of just about everything except for the smoked pork ribs with watermelon pickle; don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but the sauce was a little too much salty/sweet for me to fully enjoy them as a meal. I'd recommend them if you were going to split them between 4-6 people.My perfect meal just might be the wood-fired oysters to start, Louisiana cochon as an entr\u00e9e (it was like the meal of my dreams: pork topped with pork crackling and served with some of my favorite things, cabbage and turnips) with a side of smothered greens. Not into pork? (blasphemy!) Their braised beef shoulder is phenomenal, too. I'm not much into dessert, but their pineapple upside down cake is divine; if you like very sweet and rich desserts, their chocolate & peanut butter pie will hit the spot.Overall, highly recommended.

And a Cochon, you will. Not to say that it's exorbitantly expensive but it's certainly gonna cost you at least $30, probably more. But it's certainly worth it.For starters we had the baked oysters and the boucherie board. Both were great, with the oysters having more spice and less salt than some of the other, inferior, baked oysters of the trip. The boucherie came with various slices of ham and ham based products along with great sweet and soure pickles and some bread. The variety was great and none of the cuts were too salty.Course two consisted of headcheese, breaded and fried covered in lima beans and a minty cream sauce. Though you weren't able to get the full gelatinous glory of the head cheese, the contrast with the sauce made this my favorite dish of the meal. We also ordered this braised rib and rice thing, I forget the name but the rice cake was really excellent.Finally we had the cochon which was honestly disappointingly dry. I'm giving Cochon the benefit of the doubt that they just messed up this one order of their namesake and that if I were to return, and I certainly intend to, that it'll be moister.

I scoured all the reviews from other Yelpers with vegetarian friends and decided to call ahead and warn them about the vegetarian situation 2 hours before our reservation. Unfortunately, my vegetarian coworker was not feeling well so she canceled last minute and we were not able to test out Cochon's ability/willingness to accommodate vegetarians. Now it was just down to me and one of my coworkers. The two of us arrived about 10 minutes before our 7:30 reservation and weren't seated until 10 minutes after our reservation. Considering the crowd, I guess that wasn't too bad. I got a drink special called the Cajun Cannon while we waited. It was a tasty, fruity-flavored champagne that I'd definitely get again.Once seated, we were greeted by Reno, one of the most enthusiastic waiters I've had in a looong while. He described the daily specials like he was about to run back to the kitchen and cook them himself! All in all, fantastic service.For appetizer, we ordered the (1) wood-fired oyster roast and (2) fried boudin with pickled peppers. The oysters were good but one of them had a ton of sand in it. I'm not sure I can blame the restaurant for oysters eating sand though. The fried boudin was just ok, really not special.As entrees, I got (3) the oven roasted gulf fish \"fisherman's style\" and my coworker went with the (4) Louisiana cochon with turnips, cabbage & cracklins. My \"gulf fish\" turned out to be Louisiana Redfish and it was pretty good in some parts, but pretty fishy in other parts. The portion was large, but I'm not sure that could excuse fishy fish when we're in this close to the water. My coworker's pork was superb and I assumed it was the house specialty, considering the restaurant seems to be named after it. Even if I'm totally making that up, it was a better choice than my fish.For dessert, we got the (5) pineapple upside-down cake as recommended by Reno. The cake was a tad dry and too dense for my taste but they do a pretty good job of supplying you with caramel sauce and key lime ice cream on the side to help with that issue. The key lime ice cream should be a dessert by itself. I wish I could buy a pint of it and keep it in my freezer for \"emergencies\". If you're female, you know what ice cream emergencies are like. If you're male, then most likely you have been the victim of an ice cream emergency at some point so you should also know what I'm talking about.Our total for 2 apps, 2 entrees, a dessert, and 1 beer = $108 after tip.

The ham hock did not offer enough flavor. The sweet potatoes lacked something, perhaps brown sugar, vanilla, or butter. I'm really not sure, but I was sorely disappointed. On a positive note, the service was wonderful. My server was very knowledgeable and accommodating. In my opinion, Cochon is overrated and overpriced.

The question is, is it enough to live up to an outsider's built up fantasy of the ultimate, authentic New Orleans food orgy for a pretty price. For me, the answer was: damn near.Even at 2 p.m. or so, there was a healthy crowd feeding. We were able to be seated immediately at a wooden table for two by the gigantic windows that sent the afternoon light shooting into the modern space that seemed more akin to a cafe or fancy college dining center than a place that served what we were about to eat.My friend and I went nuts. She sprang for a stiff cocktail named The Swinekiller, while I went for a light state brewed bottle Bayou Teche 31LA as in Louisiana, not Las Angeles) 31 Grenache. Ordering commenced, and we got cracklins (not on the menu! You just have to ask!) for a few bucks since we hadn't had the opportunity to grab a bag of the hot pork rinds from a gas station on the rural highway. We followed this up with Fried Alligator With Chili Garlic Ailoli ($10), Macaroni and Cheese Casserole ($5), and Smothered Greens ($5).When it came to the main course, we felt pretty tortured by the singular displays of terroir with their simultaneously local and exotic fare. Fried rabbit livers with pepper jelly toast? No, we felt bad for the rabbits. Boudin? We were sure that would be a winner, but we'd tried it already for breakfast at Surrey's (separate review). Oyster & met pie? Shaved hog head?? Catfish courtbouillon??? And what about the namesake Louisiana cochon?In the dramatic moments of our final decision, we both swerved for the $25 daily special - a local redfish roasted in the brick and coal oven \"Fisherman's Style.\"This was to be the wisest choice of all. Cracklins were cracklins. The alligator was fresh, but beyond salty (even for this salt fiend). Mac & cheese was delicious, but standard, and the smothered collard were a tad limp (even for being smothered), and had a sweet undertone. One curious thing was that someone different brought us each component of the meal. Our waitress brought the alligator, but the sides and entrees appeared at the hands of men in khakis and button down shirts (perhaps Chef/Owner Donald Link and General Manager Tomy Lagneaux!).The fish, however, was not only the highlight of the meal but a standout of 2011 and perhaps all the significant fish consumed in my 30 year old life. Only lightly herbed in Cajun spices and devoid of bone but still on the skin, it had an outdoorsy hint of smoke but the sweet inner purity of the water from whence it came. It was also about three pounds of fish meat, and we felt slightly horrendous rolling ourselves down Canal to the ferry.For the record, the difference between Creole and Cajun is that \"Creole\" is the French word for \"from here,\" and refers to the melding of cultures that occurred in historic New Orleans between settlers of French descent, British invaders, runaway slaves, and even Native Americans. Cajun is believed to be a Native American adaptation of the word \"Acadian,\" for a bunch of French Nova Scotians who chain migrated to the swamps of Louisiana way back when and subsisted off of the land and its strange creatures.This said, Cochon was a great experience in Cajun Southern Cooking. But save for the fish (which did at least half the work and the open fire the other half), we'll never know if Cajun cooking is what we really had, or if it was a dressed up (paid $50 each) replication of what once was in those uncharted bayous.", "Date": "2011-11-14", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Chris D.", "ReviewID": "qwiPGqBw3lSIaLDll_Aqvw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You had me with a whole roasted pig.Everything else could have been slop and I wouldn't have cared. \u00a0However, it wasn't slop and, every, single, dish, I tried was damn good.Great mix of southern flair with lots of pig parts.Service is spot on.Drinks are spot on...but could use a little more local brews on tap.The interior is well done and a welcome change from the typical NO restaurant. \u00a0I see why this chef is a leader of the industry in NO.Great space, location, and general feel.If you go...and like pigs...you'll love it. \u00a0Not much for vegetarians but there are seafood options that are done very very well.", "Date": "2012-04-20", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Geoff P.", "ReviewID": "wy57eD6DmX92Sr5NJg6uGg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While my better half and I disagree as to whether Cochon is #1 or #2 on our list of favorite NOLA eateries, there is no question Cochon is an amazing place .

It was good gumbo, but not much differentiated from other good gumbo on the trip. The fried alligator tail was every bit as good as folks have said. Yep - order it.As for dinner, the food was good. My friends both really enjoyed the brisket, and the volcanically hot mac and cheese side. My friend and I thought the cochon was good, but maybe not as special as we had hoped. The twice-baked potato side was gigantic, and is very shareable (as was the mac and cheese).Our server was slow on keeping our water full, slow on taking our orders, slow on bringing dessert menus (really??), and slow on our checks.

Cochon is a simple, rustic wood panelled room that serves up simple and delicious classic southern cuisine. The smell of barbecue entices one to venture inside from Tchoupitoulas Street, affectionately called \"Chop Street\" in these parts.What's Really Good? Chef Link's restaurant offers a number of classic Cajun southern dishes, a style of cooking and food which he has worked at professionally since the tender age of 15. The attention to detail in these slow foods and cooking really shows. A fantastic selection of bourbon and local craft beers from Abita and NOLA really pair with, and elevate Link's cuisine.As for the menu, the fried alligator with chili garlic aioli seems like an appropriate start to any southern meal. The breading is light, the flavour of the alligator quite rich, and the aioli is a welcome accoutrement for those looking for a hint of spice. The paneed pork cheeks with roasted corn grits and tomato salad are awesomely succulent and tender; the pork cheeks pull apart with your fork to create a smoky, salty and rich dish.You'll Wanna KnowThough the menu changes seasonally, and frequently, there is sure to be a classic southern dish to all tastes which can be enjoyed.

I started with the fried alligator tail, and my wife got the mushroom salad...wow, both dishes were FANTASTIC! I would definitely recommend the alligator, but the mushroom salad with beef jerky and mint is also very unique and a surprisingly delicious combination. We got to know a couple sitting next to us at the chef's counter, and they both raved about the beef brisket. As a lover of all things cow, I obviously went the brisket route: smart choice! The brisket along with the horseradish potato salad was superb. Also, because I love eggplant, I got a side of the eggplant with shrimp.

We made a reservation for 8:30 on a Tuesday and as we walked up the street all of the surrounding restaurants were deserted. Cochon was absolutely busting at the seams, always a great sign! The interior sounds terrible on paper, but is really cool looking. It is a mix of wood, plaster, brick, and metal but it is very inviting and interesting to look at. The place is very open and it was fun seeing the kitchen and the plates being expedited. We decided on a few small plates and were absolutely delighted. Here is a run down of our meal:Fried alligator with chili garlic aioli - I seriously couldn't have been more pleased when this hit my palate. The perfect mixture of salt, sweet, and spicy. The alligator was the tinniest bit tough but this was one of those dished that I didn't want to end...ever. Spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle - Do yourself a favor and give these ribs a try. I have never tasted ribs like this before and trust me I have eaten plenty of ribs! The sauce was perfect and the watermelon had a wonderful texture and flavor. I know, watermelon doesn't have the most distinct flavor and you would think that it would get lost with the ribs but this is culinary genius on a plate people!Iceberg lettuce with bacon bits, radishes and peppercorn dressing - This salad was disappointing, but frankly we needed some vegetables in our lives after all of the Soul Food. Skip the salad, stick to the meat.Mac and Cheese Casserole - The mac and cheese was definitely delicious, but just a little bit salty. That certainly didn't stop me from eating every tiny morsel, especially the edges around the mini cast iron pan.Fried Peach Pie with salted caramel sauce and sour cream ice cream - I am obsessed with peach pie and I certainly can't find it in Vegas so I capitalized on the chance to try it here. The pie and the ice cream were good, but the caramel sauce overpowered everything else on the plate. I think this dish would have been more successful without the sauce.Overall, we had an excellent dining experience.

My expectations were for REAL Cajun food not a bouchey replacement of southern style Cajun food. It could be because I was craving good Cajun seafood and the hotel recommended this place--known for their pork not seafood.My friend and I ordered family style so we could sample a few dishes each. We both tried the crab bisque, which at first seemed over spiced but then became enticing and addictive! It was very good! I believe they use a heavy cream in it, so it could a meal in itself. Next we tried the alligator, also a disappointment. It was breaded and over sauced, really masking the alligator. It was more of a disappointment to me because my friend had never tried alligator and this was not a great way to start! We finished up with the rabbit and dumplings which was perfect! It was spiced and cooked to perfection! The meat was very tender and the dumplings browned just right! I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for some good pork, I heard it was fantastic and they have the butcher right there in the kitchen preparing the meat! --Im not a porker-(porkeater)As far as the drinks go, they have an extensive wine by the glass list, many beers on tap, including Abita(root beer)! We tried a few cocktails; 2 out of 3 were pretty decent but you can't have too high of hopes ordering a mojito in Louisiana! As far as the price for potions--This place is a tad overpriced.

If you've read my reviews, you know he's a chef and likes pork anything. I found Cochon thanks to the concierge at the W Hotel on a business trip, and have gone every time, sometimes more than once, each time I've been in New Orleans.So finally, we're in New Orleans on our honeymoon. I made us a reservation like 2 months in advance, which I'd never done and had always sat at the bar before. This time though, the weather conspired against us and a crazy thunderstorm moved in an hour before dinner. I called a cab, and they weren't sure they could get someone to us in time but they did! On the way over to Cochon lighting streaked across the sky, and the rain continued to fall. We arrived at Cochon but there was nowhere the cab driver could let us off that didn't have 6 inches of water. I took my shoes off and made a run for the door, putting my shoes back ON before entering the restaurant.We were seated, by the always friendly host staff, and proceeded to order drinks, then the charcuterie, the mushroom salad with house-made beef jerky (fancy slim jim), pickled shrimp, as well as the fried oyster and bacon sandwich, and the mustard crusted ham hock. Everything was delicious, nothing took too long to arrive. For dessert we had the pineapple upside down cake, the butterscotch pudding and coffee. I will say, the wait staff, not the best I've experienced there. I get the impression they want people to eat it and beat it, and our waitress wasn't all that friendly, and didn't refill our water glasses or offer another cup of coffee. She was walking away from our table before I had a chance to even ask. I know it's a decent sized restaurant and always busy but this was really off-putting and not something I'd experienced before when sitting at the bar -- even though I was almost always there alone. I don't know what the problem was, but considering the kind of place it is, the idea that I would ever have to ask for a water refill is pretty inexcusable.I am so glad I finally got to take my husband here, and the meal was delicious, but I wish I wasn't having to remove a star from my rating because of the service.

During our visit in New Orleans, we were able to dine at Cochon where Stephen Stryjewski had won the James Beard Award for Best Chef in the South. It was easy to see why he was given this prestigious honor.I arranged for a group of my clients to join us at Cochon for a late reservation. This worked out really well, because the menu is designed with many small plates. Thus we were able to order several different plates and share in a \"tapas style\" manner.We first started off with a round of drinks. The drink for me was decent, but not spectacular. All I remember is that there was watermelon in the drink. It also took a while to receive our drinks, though to the restaurant's credit, it was a packed house. (There were 20,000 librarians in town!) As I could tell that all of the menus were printed frequently, I decided to order by writing on the menu what the table wanted. The waiter said that was unique and the first time anyone had done that.About 15 minutes later and all of our dishes came out simultaneously. Here they are in no particular order. We have here Artichoke &amp; crab stuffed crab. It was very tasty with the accompanying crisps (perhaps pita?) adding a nice textural contrast.Next is the wood-fired oyster roast. What a great preparation of the oyster, served very warm.Here was the dish I was dying to try: Fried alligator with chili garlic aioli. Though the alligator is a little chewier (not rubbery, just meatier) it was super delicious. The chili garlic aioli gave it a wonderful tang that I can still taste two weeks later.One small plate was simply named hushpuppies. That being said, there was nothing simple about them. They we're phenomenal. The sauce accompanying it was fantastic! One of my clients does not like hushpuppies at all, but fell in love with this version. Everyone also loved the sauce, wanting to have it bottled up. By the way, we loved the hushpuppies so much that we ordered a second round.Cochon is french for pig. Thus a visit to Cochon wouldn't be complete without trying some pork. Thus we ordered the boucherie plate. I don't recall all the various pieces but it did include the following: Headcheese - My first experience with it and the texture is off-putting to me personally, though it had good flavor.Pork Rillette - Again, a first for me. A rillette is a paste that is put on bread. The problem was that we didn't get enough bread. On its own, again it had flavor, but it needed the bread.House Made Bread &amp; Butter Pickles - This is my favorite type of pickle and...WOW... just WOW! They nailed the pickles. Perfect amount of tang and bite. Could've eaten a jar of them. One of my clients ordered a zucchini salad. Huh?, I thought. A Zuchinni salad? At a restaurant with pig as its name?.... I'm glad they ordered it. It really helped to balance the meal. Most of the other dishes we ate were warm dishes. This salad, which had so much wonderful flavor, was a cool dish and thus added a great balance in temperature. Lesson learned: don't knock a salad at Cochon.About 5 minutes after we submitted our \"menu order\" to our server, he came back and said that the \"spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle\" (another anticipated dish) was gone for the night. In lieu of the ribs, our waiter suggested the Pork Cheeks with lima beans. They were enjoyable and still tasted similar to braised ribs.The third dish I was personally anticipating was Rabbit and dumplings. This was another first for me. (Do you notice a pattern emerging?) The rabbit was juicy and succulent. With the accompanying gravy it was very similar to turkey in taste and texture.One of my clients, before ordering, asked what the \"Smothered Green Beans\" were smothered in. Our waiter said, bacon, wine, butter... Thus she ordered them. Bacon? YUM! They were a nice side to the meal.One of my low-lights of the evening was the chicken and andouille gumbo. For me, it was over salted. Two others really enjoyed it, so maybe I just got a bad batch?One of the sad but funny things of the night was Dessert. Our waiter came and said, \"I wanted to let you know that we currently have 20,000 librarians in New Orleans... and... well... they ate all of our dessert.\" He went on to inform us that they noticed that librarians really enjoy dessert and they had planned for an increase in food, but not as much for dessert... He did offer a few options of ice cream, but we were quire content at that point and declined.Chef Stryjewski lived up to the prestige as a James Beard award winner.

I thankfully had a partner helping me out and we still left a bite or two on the plate- it was THAT filling. \u00a0Heck, the entrees were big portions too. \u00a0That is another great part of Cochon: it is a great value.

My latest visit was my second, and will surely not be my last.Dining solo, I sat at the chef's counter and got to see the kitchen staff in action, which was a treat. Cochon's mostly gen-X/Y wait staff is attentive to the extreme, which results in a more up-paced tempo of dining than most New Orleans restaurants. After each plate of food I finished, someone was beside me within a few seconds taking away my plate and giving me something else. With most of my dining experiences being in Boston and the northeast, I am used to this pacing (and enjoy it), but I can see how some folks may be annoyed by it.I started with a cup of Pork and Black Eyed Pea Gumbo ($6), a hearty soup that also featured collard greens. This was a country gumbo made with a dark roux and combined together many of the flavors I associate with Louisiana into a very satisfying stew.Compliments of the chef, I received a gratis amuse-bouche of Pig Liver Terrine with Toast Points, Creole Mustard, and Sweet Pickle Slices. Unlike liver from other animals, I found pork liver to have a more mild taste. It was meaty, creamy, rich, and was perfect when spread on my toast points, covered with the mustard and pickle slices. I wish they'd put this on the menu, as I'd gladly pay for it the next time I'm at Cochon.I moved on to the Fried Boudin Balls with Pickled Peppers ($8). This may very well be the best appetizer I've ever had in New Orleans. These deep fried balls of boudin (pronounced boo-dan) sausage delivered incredible taste by themselves, but paired with the pickled hot peppers and a generous amount of creole mustard (for dipping), they were beyond excellent.Next was the Smoked Pork Ribs with Watermelon Pickles ($10). Their ribs are a third of a slab of pork baby back ribs covered in a spicy BBQ sauce with cube-shaped watermelon pickles sprinkled on top. Bringing together both sweet and subtle shades of sour, I'd put the quality of these ribs against those of just about any roadside BBQ joint in this country. I also ordered the Twice-Baked Stuffed Potato ($5), a nice starchy side to my ribs with melted cheese, green onions, butter.After all of this, I unfortunately had no room left for dessert. With a bottle of Abita Turbo Dog beer, my entire meal (every bit of it outstanding) came to $38. Amazingly, many of the online reviewers for Cochon complain about the price. To those people I would say that if you're expecting Applebees prices, you're in the wrong place. And I do understand that there are lots of reasons why someone may feel uncomfortable paying for higher-end cuisine -- we all prioritize things differently. But for people to complain that Cochon is overpriced is ridiculous. An awful meal at Mulate's is only a few bucks less, a meal at mediocre joints like Morton's or Bourbon House is going to cost the same or more, and the chasm in food quality and service between all of those places and Cochon is enormous. One last thing: this place is not for vegetarians. There is nothing on the menu for that lifestyle.

Thankfully, he wasn't our server. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, but a little sterile. The menu was filled with all types of interesting items, so we ended up ordering several small plates and sides. The wife ordered one of their house cocktails which had several componets,...watermelon, cucumber, and ginger. She said it was very balanced and tasted like summer in a glass. I had a local beer, NOLA Hurricane Saison. First time I've tried their beer and it was pretty impressive. So our order consisted of the fried alligator, oyster and crawfish pie, chicken and andoullie gumbo, boudin balls, grits, and greens. And we finished with the peach pie a la mode with salted caramel. The presentation was good, the food was almost too rich, but delicious none the less. (Yeah, we did order lots of fried food) The grits though were over the top rich, don't order that and expect to eat it all by yourself. Could have made a meal out of the greens alone, they were flavorful and cooked perfectly. The boudin balls were very flavorful and rich. The alligator went very well with the chili aioli. The gumbo was very tasty, but I would have liked it a little thicker in consistency, but everyone has their own style of gumbo. The oyster and crawfish pie was amazingly delicious, could have eaten several of those. And last but not least, the peach pie, (more like an individual hand pie, I like the concept) was well plated, and very balanced. The caramel sauce was perfect, not overly salted, just right.

He grew up in Louisiana, left for SF, went to culinary school, returned to his New Orleans roots to open restaurants. Local boy does good. The pig-themed Cochon is what I would describe as cajun with a fine dining twist. We arrived a bit before our reservation time so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks from the cocktail menu. With names like The Swinekiller, Hillbilly Mary and Louisiana Hayride, the cocktails incorporated local flavors into intriguing blends. I spied large canning jars full of what looked like cherries and upon inquiry was told they were indeed house made maraschino cherries made by with local cherries and cooked down in maraschino liquor. Our bartender explained that the chef makes tons of these cocktail garnishes during the summer when cherries are in season and by the end of winter/early spring they near the end of their supply. He obliged my curiosity and gave us each a sample of the crimson red cherry. Boozy delicious. Fortified with cocktails, we started our meal with the fried alligator with chili garlic aioli. Big pieces of gator dipped in the piquant aioli was a nice combo. I was expecting the meat to be tough, but was glad I was incorrect in my assumption. Next we moved on to the boudin. After a little research I discovered that boudin is a truly cajun country classic. Much like chorizo or sausage stuffed with rice and other cajun spices, boudin is ubiquitous. Cochon's version was much different than what we later tried at a truck stop in cajun country and was served with house pickled peppers. The mushroom salad with lemon was out of this world. Thinly sliced shrooms lightly dressed with herbs and citrus was a dish that lightened things up after the boudin and fried alligator. For my entree I tried the signature dish, the cochon, which can best be described as a ball of tender pulled pork topped with cracklins. Talk about pork overload. The oven roasted gulf fish served fisherman's style came to the table hole with the skin on and was perfectly prepared. Cochon seems to be a nuevo NOLA way to experience cajun food and although I have no idea about what constitutes \"good\" cajun food, our experience at Cochon was good enough for this cajun-deprived West Coaster.", "Date": "2011-02-13", "Author_Location": "El Cerrito, CA"}, {"Author": "Kimberly C.", "ReviewID": "B90VHr8B-B-_GFvrnZKwxw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This restaurant looks like it's been beaten to the bush with all of the same reviews being given.

It's more of a gourmet take on the dish and definitely tasty, but it won't change your life. Grilled oysters: Cochon's oysters look like they can make Acme's cry- they're HUGE and equally as tasty. They don't have the butter/parmesan seasoning that Acme has though- it's more of a chili dressing. Gumbo: the rue base is amazing in the dish. It's been cooked/stewed for so long that the flavor profile almost takes on as if extra butter and some beer were added. Rabbit and dumplings: must get!

I fell in love with eating gator meat after this day, although it still makes me sad as I think they're cute. The fried alligator bits are covered in a chili aoli sauce, along with some sauteed onions and I believe mint. Great combination. It felt like I was popping calamari in my mouth. I would've ordered this as an entree if I could have. We also ordered an oyster appetizer that was good as well.They also have good sides. I of course had to order the macaroni and cheese. Not the best I've had, but still pretty darn good. For $5, you get a good amount. The grits here are what had me change my opinion of grits as well. So friggin good! As for entrees, I went with the rabbit and dumplings, and my friend and I shared this along with the smoked beef brisket with horseradish potato salad. 2 ordered the chicken, and one ordered the cochon. The chicken and brisket were incredibly dry. Such a bummer. My friend with the cochon said it was just okay, and the rabbit and dumplings were in a stew that I did not care for.

The Smoked Beef Brisket with Horseradish Potato Salad tasted pretty good and I would recommend eating the Horseradish Potato Salad with the Smoked Beef Brisket; otherwise, the potato salad might be too strong of a taste. The Macaroni & Cheese Casserole was not too big but it complemented perfectly with my entr\u00e9e. It tasted good especially in the few areas where it was baked to have a crispy texture.

The pork dish had a nice balance of sweet and savory and my rabbit was comforting. \u00a0Despite how full I was we still ordered dessert for the table. \u00a0Dessert did not disappoint - full of Southern, fatty charm! \u00a0We ordered the pumpkin/pecan pie and the key lime pie: rich, fatty goodness that was worth risking my ability to get into a dress for the wedding.Minor complaint - the waitstaff while extremely attentive bordered on excessively attentive. \u00a0We were asked about 3-4x how everything was during each course. \u00a0That means we were interrupted about a dozen times during our dinner to ask how we were doing. \u00a0I like when the staff comes by to check on us, but it got annoying after the 6th or so time.", "Date": "2010-12-09", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Moe f.", "ReviewID": "zsZi7sxEHGe3Rv-QKYAQQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place was amazing.

Rabbit with dumplings:A rabbit stew with dumplings. Good luck finding much rabbit in this stew. This stew again did no justice to a wonderful meat. Rather the meat is shredded so much you can hardly taste the rabbit and barely find the little bit of it they give you. Drink: Apple Bobber Cocktail. A delicious apple-y bourbon tasting cocktail.

Cochon is like a 5 star BBQ joint and in some ways is like eating at the ritziest picnic table on the planet. Pickled mason jars are strewn about in a location that you know has so much history. I mean c'mon is New Orleans for Pete sakes... every space is basically magical.I dont even know how to elaborate on a menu that needs no elaboration. Everything is delicious but I will pick out a few highlights.The wood fired oysters. DELICIOUS. On one visit, I basically wanted to order a few plates of this, and ONLY this. ITS THAT GOOD. The pickled shrimp and corn just explodes with flavor in such a unique, light and fresh way. The fried boudin...oh if you have ever had good boudin..this one is its rival.....and that vinegar they serve it with. WOW. I wasn't much of a fan of the fried alligator. in fact I sent it back, but it was promptly removed, no questions asked and replaced with whatever I wanted from the menu (I went for more oysters :) Thats not to say it was not good....it was just not for me.You might have noticed that I REALLY didn't elaborate on Pig... well thats because I don't really eat pig (small doses for me). That doesn't mean Cochon is not for you.I would have never thought that a pig joint would be one of my favorite haunts....and it is. \u00a0I think about this restaurant and how perfect it is often.

This is undeniable in the warm familial atmostphere and stunning bites that define Cochon.I LOVE food but occasionally when I open a menu and see items that have been served up SO BADLY, SO OFTEN I shudder at the thought of trying said things again (see alligator often too tough to swallow much less use for anything other than a fleshy baseball OR Boudin often so dry and just horribly gamey it is inedible) but I was heading to Cochon with a group of 5th generation cajuns and it was a Link eatery so I dove in...and we were all thrilled we did.GET A RESERVATION. This is not optional. No reservation? Unless it is the middle of summer with 180% humidity and everyone has left town you won't get a seat.The local liquor selection is divine. They usually carry at least 4 Abita's on draft at any given time. The bartenders there are true mixologists and will not steer you wrong. Don't know what to drink with your dinner? Ask them. They know exactly the perfect compliment.The fried alligator with Garlic aioli was like a bit of \"fried fried heaven\" in my mouth. The alligator was firm but not tough and the seasoning scrumptious. The boudin with the mustard and pickled peppers looked a bit tart to me on paper but turned out to be a revelation when served. The rabbit and dumplings was just one of the most amazing things I have ever put in my mouth EVER. It was so fresh tasting with the veggies and the rabbit was fall apart tender. The brisket was almost obscene it was so good with the smokey, seasoning playing perfectly against the kick of the horseradish in the potato salad.It was beautifully executed, lacking the snobbery and just simple, brilliantly paired food that was clearly created by someone who loves Louisiana cuisine. Is it a bit \"much\"? HELL YES! But isn't that by definition what New Orleans is all about. It is a celebration of excess and it succeeds perfectly!I could eat here everyday.

How we got in without a reservation is unclear to me--lucky, I guess. Cute atmosphere that is rustic and elegant all at the same time. Small bar up front and a chef's table in the back that overlooks the open kitchen. Service was fantastic (there were a few folks tending to our table), yet casual and unintrusive. We started with the joy juice, which was a dangerously delicious moonshine-containing cocktail. I also sampled another orangey-bourbon cocktail that was quite tasty. They have an interesting bourbon list here, including flights, that I would definitely go for if I returned.For food, I started with the crab-artichoke app. I LOVE blue crab, and this mix with tasty artichoke served in the top of a cleaned-out crab shell was fantastic! One of my companions got the alligator app, which I sampled--more breading/hot sauce than gator, but quite tasty all the same. For an entree I got the namesake cochon--deliciously spiced pulled-pork shaped into a patty and deep-fried; simply wonderful. Sides were tasty as well, with turnips, cabbage, and, of course, cracklins! Others got the ham hock and the brisket, both of which looked fantastic, and all were pleased with the offerings.

It was nothing short of phenomenal. The oyster roast, for one, was absolutely delicious. I am a big fan of oysters and constantly on the lookout for oyster bars and such and I must say Cochon did a great job: the sauce complimented the fresh, succulent seafood and every single oyster was of a decent size! (Really hate it when you get a teeny quarter size dollop of a meat :P)Coming from Florida, I am not unfamiliar with gator dishes. I have had some pretty blah/icky ones where the meat just tastes like..chewy-er chicken seasoned with a hint of dirt. Thankfully it wasn't the case with Cochon! They did a really good job breading the gator meat and wow! the chili garlic aoli sauce! I love the perfect amount they tossed the fried gator in. I enjoyed it :)However! I had my FIRST boudin here and I must say it was really spectacular. It reminded me of Chinese meatballs but instead of in a stew it's fried/seared. Super yummy.Of course, we got the mirliton, celery & grapefruit salad because all that meat needed to be balanced out. It was light and fresh and everything I wanted it to be. Oh, mirliton is basically a squash-like vegetable.Needless to say, it's not a meal unless there's dessert involved! :D Pineapple Upside-Down Cake was the one we decided to get and ohhh my God...Amazing.So good.Especially that coconut-lime sorbet.

The post-modern lodge style dining room amuses with porcine decor, sleek, utlilitarian picnic-style tables, benches and stools. A warehouse location and trendy bar crowd sets the scene.Complimentary bread has become so passez over the years, even those pencil thin breadsticks and wafer thin parmesan flatbread are so yawn that it's mighty refreshing when someone plops down a basket of WARM HOMEMADE POTATO ROLLS in front of you.

The rolls and consideration for jaded-foodie palates gets 5 stars.Cochon does small plates and entrees so you can get your fill of local favorites and house specialties. Standouts from the Boucherie are fried boudin balls with pieces of pulled pork and deep flavor. My small plate of BBQ pork ribs came out cold though the sauce was tangy and sweet enough while I was looking for more smokiness. Fried pigs ears and rabbit livers I see more of a novelty for people like my dinner companion for whom having something fried and/or weird is a must for every fine dining experience. There's plenty of love for the local cuisine: My hen and adouille gumbo had a flavourful (and memorable) dark roux. Roasted Gulf redfish (a specialty of the chef) was picture perfect and it's flesh is melt in your mouth. A side of pecan-broccoli dressing was (surprise!) gratineed and rich. And, the eponymous Louisiana cochon was salty, moist and flavorful-\"very enjoyable\" said my wide-eyed companion.Of course, the fruit cobbler was a must, but sadly the only real disappointment of the night. The local strawberries were warm with a natural non-cloying sweetness but clashed with the somewhat doughy biscuits baked with a distracting (in a bad way) hint of ginger. My one suggestion for the dessert menu is to make a traditional lattice cobbler topping or biscuits without ginger. I loved everything else, this just made for an odd finish.Cochon was the culinary risk of my most recent trip to New Orleans. I had turned down Brigsten's and boycotted Besh.

When we got the restaurant it was fairly empty and filled up within an hour. I do not like being seated on a long bench with my husband across from me. I hate this style of seating. There was a couple eating 2 feet on either side of us. As soon as I saw where they were seating us, I was completely disheartened. If i'm expected to spend $$$ for a meal, I want a table and chairs or a booth not a half booth. I actually stopped to ask to be seated elsewhere but suddenly I was under a spell or momentum of the hostess indicating I needed to slide in between to tables, that I \u00a0said nothing. Since it's a team, it's hard to know who was doing what. Our dark haired waitress gave us menus, then returned \"do you know what you want?\" \u00a0When the couples on either side of us left and a new pair was seated on either side of us, their server told them the great specials, we didn't get told about. Immediately I wanted to change my order, but no employee came our way until our food was served and let me tell you that even through that was likely only 5-10 minutes, it seemed like a cavern of time. A team service person brought out our food, followed with a new person came ask how our food was after it was mostly gone and in looking at the open restaurant I was noticing our waitress was not in the room. The busser was great at clearing away our plates and filling our water and folding my husbands' napkin when he went to the restroom. \u00a0Our waitress came back after I had soured, and no mater how wonderful the food was my husband got it in his mind this place was too hipster for him, the terrible waitress and hipster music caused him to announce he didn't care about his meal and was ready to leave. So in a week in New Orleans for Halloween, my only memory of my meal was a great craft cocktail, the apple bobber.

The oysters, oh the oysters, they were not an overwhelming small plate of garlic but rather a fabulous blend of garlic to sauce to bivalve. The grits with the yard eggs and mushrooms were an artful take on a staple of southern cooking. The one place where the restaurant needs serious help is the bar. The drinks are uninteresting, poorly constructed, here's a tip, try a measuring cup or spoon. Either there's too much alcohol or too much sugar, or sometimes both! After having a drink on the menu we stuck to the beer. If they got the bar in shape and brought in some real mixology I think this joint would be a force to be reckoned with.

Not wanting to commit to just one entree, I cobbled a meal together by ordering two apps: the fried boudin and the meat pie. The boudin was delicious. The loose sausage was rolled with rice into balls, then battered and fried to a crisp. The empanada-like meat pie was also a great choice. Flaky on the outside and wonderfully unctuous on the inside, it was a filling -- and pleasing -- dish. Much like the gumbo, both of these were perfect for a stormy Tuesday. Nova, conversely, probably had too little to eat. She ordered the smoked brisket with potato salad. While it was incredibly flavorful, the portion size was also a little modest.

I didn't get to taste the ribs, but they looked great, and everyone else loved them. The Alligator was perhaps over-fried but still tasty. The rabbit livers were AWESOME. I could eat a plate of them right now. \"Oyster Roast\" is oysters on the half shell with a bit hot sauce, thrown into a hot oven. Very nice - although I prefer them on the bbq if you're going to cook them... I might have used a little less sauce and a hotter oven. The boucherie was great, especially the \"pig face\". Oh yes, and an order of the soup of the day, which was EXCELLENT. Entrees were Rabbit & Dumplings, Roasted Fish \"Fisherman's Style\", and two massive over-roasted pork chops. The chops were impressive, very juicy and very tasty. I wish I had tried a bit of the rabbit, because it looked amazing. The fish was beautifully done. Great cocktails - I will admit to having three whiskey sours made with Bernheim Wheat Whiskey -- very nice. Great design and nice view of the kitchen and big wood-burning oven.

Well, the answer to that is yes and no.The decor is wonderful and we got seated well ahead of the time we had our reservations for. Although the place was fairly packed, service was quite good and our glasses did not stay empty for much time.Going into Cochon, I already knew what I wanted to try. Some of the input was from opinions on here, as well as of locals who we met at bars. We just had to try the fried alligator, rabbit livers, and pork cheeks. For entrees, I had the Louisiana cochon, while my boyfriend ordered the Rabbit & Dumplings - which was raved about on here.The fried alligator was quite good. Although a bit tough, the aioli it was smothered in was divine and just perfect. NOM, indeed. As far as the rabbit livers go, I was not impressed. The breading kept completely falling off the livers, and they tasted rather bland. I'm actually surprised to read the other reviews about how \"flavorful\" they were. Maybe I received a batch from the boring chef?By far, the most standout item of the night were the pork cheeks. Oh. My. God. Anthony Bourdain does not lie when he claims that the cheeks are the filet mignon of the pig. They were so soft, and tender that it brings a tear to my eye when I think of the deliciousness. The sauce they come in is perfect and the little pieces of beets just round it all up.My entree, the cochon was also very very good. It was tender and filling and I would order it again in a heartbeat. I wish I could say the same for the rabbit & dumplings. The dish was very bland and contained these turnip-like veggies that still had a hard skin on them. I wish I could tell you what they were but they completely unappetizing and threw my boyfriend off from the whole meal.

We followed up with the beef brisket, cochon, and the smoked ham hock. For dessert, we sampled an ice cream and pie contraption.The fried alligator was pleasantly spicy and well-cooked; however, it did seem awkward compared to the rest of the comparably more elegant and higher-class fare. The liver cheese with hog jowls (like bacon in their consistency) was amazing and a different flavor than one would normally be exposed to. The cheese is very strong -- a little goes a long way! The mains will be reviewed from worst to best (in my opinion). The cochon, while delicious, was the least favorite thing we sampled -- surprising, considering that it is the namesake of the restaurant. What is cochon, you might ask? It's basically twice-cooked pulled pork. The brisket was prepared in a somewhat unconventional way that left it with a lighter color, yet it was still delicious with its sauce and very tender. Finally, the ham hock was amazing. The smoked flavor goes perfectly with the hock of the pig, and the meat flaked away from the bone in a way that can be described as gorgeous. \"There's a pie under this ice cream!\" I exclaimed in joy as we began dessert. It was a chocolate salty caramel contraption, and that should sell anyone on trying it. Wonderful.

The salt level of the salad was so high that I wondered what happened on the bottom of the plate since the top portion was so good. I turned it back in to the waiter with a comment. Was it that the cheese curds were the over salted culprit?I ordered the Lousiana couchon dish \u00a0of pulled pork with turnip cabbage and cracklings and some kind of sauce. The veggies were soggy and overdone. Even the turnips! The cracklings were just typical of a Mexican grocery store and not what I though a restaurant of this caliber would serve.

The meat was good enough to stand on its own, why were they over salting the food? Not something to serve people with high blood pressure. Over salting to preserve the freshness of the pork?Luckily, the staff was attentive enough to call the manager and tell him of my concerns. Will Davis, the manager came to discuss the food with me. He was patient listening to my issues. I ordered one more dish to fill the corners of my empty salt filled tummy, I ordered a shrimp and mirliton dressing side order.

We're making a special trip to New Orleans to eat SEAFOOD, not pork! If I wanted to eat rich gastropub fare, I would have stayed in snowy Chicago. As it turns out, a stop at Cochon is a must if you are making a culinary tour of NoLa. Our group made a quick stop, ordering only entrees. Of the small plates we considered, the fried alligator and fried green tomatoes looked most promising. Instead, we went straight to the good stuff and dined on the mustard-crusted ham hock ($19), the rabbit and dumplings ($20), beef brisket ($19) and Louisiana cochon ($22). The rabbit was overwhelmed by the citrus-y sauce, though the meat itself was juicy and tender. The beef brisket had a lightly smoky flavor, also juicy and tender; we would have preferred more smokiness in the sauce, but overall very tasty. This was complemented nicely with the horseradish potato salad, which had a nice tang from the horseradish without completely dominating the dish. The strengths of the restaurant's signature dish include the cracklings and the sauteed greens; unfortunately, the meat itself was dry. The highlight of the evening was, by far, the mustard-crusted ham hock. The ham itself has a crisp crust, which contrasts well with the tender meat that flakes off the bone. Though a tad salty (still drinking water as I type), it pairs well with the vinegary, tart greens and the creamy black eyed peas. I can't wait to remake this at home!Service at Cochon was better than what we have witnessed so far in New Orleans (granted, we walked in at 6pm on a Monday night).

That's all you need to know. Of course, there was not one bad thing we ate that entire meal, but those three were the ones that really stuck. The oysters are truly like nothing I've ever tasted before. How they wind up with that fiery, smoky kick infused into the juicy oysters, I have no idea, but it's genius. You need absolutely nothing to dress these up with. The rabbit and dumplings made me a rabbit believer- tender, somewhat wild-tasting meat was a great sub for the chicken version. Oh, and the alligator was my first experience eating it and I could eat theirs on the regular. Fried up in a tangy, almost buffalo-style sauce (I understand that's culinary blasphemy, but I can't think of a better way to describe it), they are lightly fried enough that you know you're eating some real meat and they're not just trying to cover it up. Don't miss that dish! Service is outstanding. I could have kicked it with our server Calvin all night, and he was wonderfully discreet in replacing my embarrassingly dirty napkin after my bout with the fall-off-the-bone ribs. I love that Cochon is doing inventive things with their food while still being really straightforward and not too gastronomically crazy.

I am truly baffled about why this place receives such good reviews. Seriously. Since \"Cochon\" is French for pig, I was excited to sample some of their porky goodness!First off, the staff is extremely rude, with an \"I couldn't be bothered\" attitude. Next, the food is simply not delicious or great or even good. It is just fair. Instead of getting a main course, I opted (with high hopes) for the 3 top picks: spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle $10, a side of creamy grits $5, and deviled egg gumbo $6. I also ordered their Swimming Hole cocktail $10 and Pineapple Upside-Down Cake with Coconut-Lime Sherbet (substituted vanilla ice-cream) $7. The best part of my main dining experience was the small pieces of pickled watermelon atop the dry-grilled (emphasis on DRY) ribs. These tasty little cubes were tangy & sweet with just the right texture. The ribs were expectedly not fork-tender (due to the preparation technique on the open grill) BUT, I was expecting them to be teeth-tender! I felt like a barbarian, attempting to render flesh from an unyielding bone! Really! I asked the waitress to exchange the leathery ribs for a more tender batch and she retorted, \"these are not meant to be super tender.\" Got it Lady, but I should still be able to chew them! Anyway, the next batch was definitely a bit less tough but still so so on the tenderness scale. The flavor was decent but not great.The grits were perfectly cooked and had a great, creamy texture but they lacked any substantive flavor. What a shame to be so well prepared yet so bland in flavor. [Editorial Note: The BEST grits in this New Orleans are still at Dante's Kitchen...hands down!]The deviled egg gumbo sounds weird right off the top, but I figured that such an odd pairing must be fabulous. Not. This dish is a big gamble, which ultimately craps out. Separately, neither the deviled egg nor the gumbo was particularly tasty. In combination, it was a train wreck. My cocktail was tasty and helped to pass the time as my mediocre meal was consumed. Surprisingly, the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake was \u00fcber delicious. I would definitely recommend this dessert, should you have a craving for fluffy, buttery and not overly-sweet pineapple cake.Overall: With so many great places to eat in this town, go elsewhere for polite staff and delicious food.

There is a small bar and a \"chef's bar/table\" to watch the goings on in the kitchen. While the wine menu is weak, at best, they do have some intriguing southern offerings, like moonshines. Paying homage to picnic tables at BBQ joints, wooden slats create the sleek chairs and bench seating. A simple, large photo of a farm adorns one wall. All of this told me, \"it's about the food.\" Hungry, we ordered the fried okra appetizer and the zucchini salad as starters. Yum, yum, yum. The okra was perfectly cooked and had a vinegar tinged ranch type dipping sauce. The zucchini salad was one of the best salads I've ever tasted in my life. Thin slices of zucchini tossed in a vinaigrette and topped with mint, parsley, pecans, goat cheese and onion. Awesome! For entrees, we ordered the pork belly and the cochon. The cochon was the winner here. The pork belly was good, but not the best I've ever had and not nearly as juicy as it should be. When I think about N.O., I always remember my first pork belly experience at Commander's Palace years ago. This didn't come close. The cochon however, was delicious. Being from North Carolina, shredded pork is BBQ for me. This was an elevated version. The pulled pork is cooked in a skilled to char the \"patty.\" \u00a0Paired with turnips, cabbage, apples, greens and cracklings, I spiced it up with the Cochon hot sauce and vinegar in peppers on the table. The hot sauce was so good, we visited \"Butcher\" the next day to pick up a couple of bottles. As our side, we had the off menu potatoes and figs cooked with lard. OMG...if we had only eaten that Cochon would have 5 stars! Perfectly cooked potatoes and figs with the charred pieces of lard on top. Inventive and divine.

Jay-Z used the Blueprint to do three things; solidify his spot at the time as a top 5 rapper (dead or alive), introduce the world to Kanye West and create one of the best rap beefs of all time. \u00a0I used Cochon to prove three things as well; New Orleans is a bada** food city, modern upscale barbeque exists and I am addicted to the swine! \u00a0Now let's talk about the food; excuse me as I shift my pants. \u00a0The spicy grilled pork ribs with watermelon pickle was Cochon's H to that Izzo, V to the Izzay, for shizzle these ribs were incredible and would have a mass appeal to everyone who comes to Cochon just like Jay's Jackson 5 sampled pop smash. \u00a0Jay's battle track \"Takeover\" is the pork cheeks with baked peanuts. \u00a0The dish may be sound a little rough at first but just like the Jim Morrison sample, if braised and cooked for a long time, it becomes super tender and unbelievably enjoyable...

This was my first time to New Orleans. While down there, I had the opportunity to visit some very well-known eateries. One of them was Cochon. A high priced, over-hyped fry kitchen. First, let me say that I expect a specific kind of elegance and complexity in my food when I visit a high class restaurant. If I want to eat a shrimp po-boy or a bucket of fried stuff I will go to a fry kitchen where I can eat all the lard I want for pennies on the dollar. Why would I do this instead of eat at a high class fry kitchen? Well it's simple. If something is coated in oil and fried, it pretty much tastes the same as anything else. You taste grease and burnt *whatever was fried*. It's not a sophisticated flavor. Certainly not one that warrants a $15 price tag for something no bigger than two quarters placed next to each other. I'm not going to say I'm a sophisticated diner. I don't have an amazing palette, I can't tell the difference between an oyster fried in ultra refined and purified butter mixed with the glandular oils from a peacock and an oyster fried in pan drippings from a chicken leg; and that's really my point. If you can't tell the difference why pay for the difference? That was really the theme of my meal. Why am I paying for this? I honestly can't tell the difference.... Maybe I'm a dimwit for not understanding, but I just didn't see the point. I ordered several items from the menu, 4 appetizers an entree and a dessert. The appetizers were pork ribs (mediocre), pork cheek (indiscernible from a tender roast), oysters (blah), and a stuffing type dish that I have forgotten. The entree was a roast with a horseradish mash of some kind (all extremely salty -- I think NOLA residents really like salt). For dessert I ordered a peach turnover -- it was disgusting. Food: 2/5Cochon is a very nicely designed restaurant. It has a very upscale vibe to it. The settings however are reminiscent to a commercialized restaurant, though I think the dim lighting causes many visitors to overlook this fact. I personally did not. I think that really is the illusion here. The hype and name results in patrons believing their food is better than it actually is. I know for a fact that I have had meals that were better than this. The difference is that when I or someone else pays a 3 digit bill for themselves, you begin to think that the restaurant must have amazing tasting food, and your brain actually causes this to be reality. I like to call it food placebo. Certainly the food isn't bad, but should I be paying top dollar for it? \u00a0Then what am I paying for, the atmosphere? Nope. I didn't see a band playing the evening I went. I didn't see anything in fact. Just a packed restaurant with people clamoring to get into the \"scene.\" If one person says it's good, nobody will argue. Nobody wants to be seen as the person who \"has no sense of taste,\" but Cochon is not tasteful. It's a hype train gone wild.Atmosphere: 3/5This place is so ridiculously expensive, it's stupid. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem dropping mad dough for an experience. I spend like a leaky faucet in a flood; however, I don't see the point in paying more than something is worth. The majority of Cochon's dishes are worth (in flavor) $5.50; however, it charges a 200% premium minimum on its dishes and serves such meager portions that you'll be wondering where the server dropped the remainder of your food and when he'll be admitting this to you. Cochon is a place you go to take the in-laws when they're visiting, your girlfriend when she's mad at you, or your parents when they come for your graduation. It is not a place you go to eat and feel satisfied.Value: 1/5The service at Cochon was adequate. The waiter came to our table 3 times over the course of 1.5 hours. Enough? Not quite. Was it busy? Certainly, but when I pay over $100 for my meal and give a $30 tip, I expect better service. Service: 3/5Cochon is such a waste of time. It really made me angry to find that a place so beloved by so many celebrity chefs was so awful. I just didn't understand it. I will NEVER go back to Cochon, EVER. I was appalled. Feel free to go if you would like, but be aware that you are not in for a culinary adventure, just a trip to fry town down Salty-Greasy Boulevard with toll booths at every block.

Cochon's food is very good and I've enjoyed eating there a few times, but an experience last weekend has prompted me to give this low rating. We were entertaining out of town guests last weekend and went to Cochon for some post-parade dinner. \u00a0The alligator appetizer was delicious and we were enjoying our drinks as well. We ordered the ham hock, which came to us covered in organic greens. I noticed that something was moving on the greens. A SMALL GREEN WORM WAS WIGGLING AROUND ON OUR FOOD! Now, I understand that they were busy that night (it is Mardi Gras, afterall) and no doubt the chefs were really churning it out., but this was so unappetizing and repellent that I pretty much lost my appetite. To top it off, we sat there for a full 10 minutes watching the thing squirm around our food before we were able to flag down a server. They were busy but when a waitress notices four people sitting at a table with a look of utter disgust on their faces, she needs to swing by and see what is up. We finally flagged down a waiter and he he swooped this off our table with a brief excuse about \"You know, those organic greens\". I realize this is a valid statement but c'mon, if I am served a bug on my food I need more of an apology from the waiter than a shrug. They brought out a new ham dish for us, which was good, but it was hard to eat after seeing such a disgusting image. I expected after that, that they would have comped the dish, sent out a free round of drinks or dessert or something to make amends, but when the bill arrived, they had charged us for the dish that had a worm., along with everything else. When a restaurant makes a mistake like this they NEED to make amends. Cochon is not cheap and it is not a little hole-in-the-wall taqueria. This is a finer dining establishment and in this case, I was not satisfied with their apology for serving me a writhing invertebrate. \u00a0 \u00a0I have one other criticism: Last year, my business partner and I hosted a work dinner for about 12. When making the reservation, I told the hostess that this was an important work dinner and it would be nice if we had a good table for our party. They sat us right near the front door in Feb, which blasted freezing air every few minutes. We dropped about $800 at that dinner while our colleagues shivered through the whole meal.

However, the food was at best mediocre, and the service was sullen/We ordered the wood fired oven oysters (5) for $11, and that was the highlight of our meal, with little more than chili oil over the oysters. However, there aren't many restaurants in NOLA that can mess up fresh oysters and this was no great feat.Next, our oyster/meat pie was flavorless and oily. Our kale/beet/egg salad was good, and mainly necessary as an acidic counterpart to the heaviness of the Louisiana cochon which--as good as the pulled pork was--is still too heavy to finish as a meal without a tart or acidic sauce, which it desperately lacked.My biggest gripe is the service. We, as a party of 2 were seated at the edgemost table of two against the side of the restaurant. The waiter for the couple next to us felt the need to squeeze himself in the space between our already too-close tables to wait on that couple, and each time his backside would hover over our food. Awful. Isn't the first rule of service is not to hang your backside over someone's food? Despite our various attempts to drop hints, i.e. move our table further out, move our food from that side of the table...he never got the hint, and continued to have his butt hover dangerously close to our dinner.No thanks--better food and service elsewhere.", "Date": "2013-01-03", "Author_Location": "Philadelphia, PA"}, {"Author": "Mindy C.", "ReviewID": "0b4K9CXOWM5DzCbbcERvmg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really loved this place!

(my pal who lives in New Orleans said I had to visit this place, as it is \"f*cking awesome!\" and she didn't lie). It ain't cheap, but you can save some dollars and try more dishes by just ordering from the small and medium plates section, rather than the $25-$45 entree items (and our meal was still less than at Emeril's restaurant, and we liked cochon a bit better). The pork cheeks were fantastic, as was the brisket served with horse-radish potato salad. Honestly, everything we ordered was yummy. While we didn't order it, our neighbors got the fish special, and it was gorgeous and oh-so-delicate. We didn't have reservations, but were able to find seating at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and very informative. They'd just added an autumn specialty cocktail (the pumpkin vine) including whiskey, and an infused pumpkin syrup that they made in house. It was divine!! Tasted like Thanksgiving, so smooth and warm, and I just wanted to curl up in front of a fireplace and drink gallons of it. ha!Although it's difficult, save room for dessert. They did NOT disappoint. The pineapple upside down cake was corn-meal based and amazing, served with a super tart lime sherbet (my mouth is watering and puckering just thinking about it). My pal had the apple pie (served with sour cream ice cream, but she's less adventurous, so substituted for regular vanilla). She said it was delicious, too. The surprising part was it was an entire mini pie, rather than a slice, which meant there was more crust/less filling ratio, but that's okay. Definitely worth the trip and the cost. And I just love that they butcher their own pigs, and utilize the whole animal. Very cool. The decor is lovely, although a bit overwhelmingly wood-y, with a blond wood (oak) covering EVERYTHING!

When the weather is cooperating they have outdoor seating, which made it possible for us to enjoy after dinner cigars, a moonshine tasting and coffee. The meal was a reflection of your typical NOLA cuisine, only amped up!We started out with some wood fired oysters, fried boudin with pickled peppers, and braised pork cheeks with sauerkraut potato cakes, applesauce and goat feta. All of these were great. Our unanimous table favorite starter was the pork cheeks. They were so tender they melted in your mouth. Our entrees included two nightly specials, one of them being the fried soft shell crab served over a salad of summer squash, black eyed peas and tomatoes. This was one of my favorite dishes, I thought it was fresh and spring-like. However for the other 3 men at the table it was not their favorite. The other special was my entree, the roasted pork loin, skin on, with creamy grits and greens. When the waiter explained it, I thought the skin would be more crisp than it was. It ended up being kinda chewy and unappetizing. This is actually is the reason that I'm only giving 4 instead of 5 stars. I will say that this was only a special, and not on the regular menu. My husband had the rabbit and dumplings. It was served in an individual sized cast iron skillet. The dumplings were not too heavy, and the gravy was magnificent. It also was a good opportunity to get to eat some rabbit, not something you find everyday on menus. The last entree we had was the Louisiana Cochon. Basically what this restaurant was named for. It was a tender piece of pork shoulder topped with crispy cracklings. Not to be missed!We did get a couple of side dishes as well. By far the star of the side dishes in my opinion was the broccoli and rice casserole. This is not your mama's casserole. So delicious. I actually could have eaten that as a meal. The grits are also amazing. They are full of butter and just creamy goodness. Like true grits should be. Our least favorite side dish was the eggplant and shrimp dressing. It was pretty tasty with good shrimp flavor, but the other side dishes on the table just out shined it. For dessert we split some lemon cream pie. We were stuffed to the brim. They also have a great cocktail menu. I had a Trotter Jennings, which is Vodka, St. Germain, Prosecco and lemon juice. Their coffee is nice and strong too. The service was excellent. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and able to answer all of our questions. He was also able to make some recommendations, something I always appreciate.

We got the last reservation left for the night and were seated right away.I got the Swinekiller ($9) to drink, he got the whiskey and amaretto drink ($10-I can't remember the name at the moment), and they were so-so. Nothing to write home about, but fairly decent.For our first course, we had the oysters ($11) and the fried alligator ($10). The oysters were our favorite part of the entire meal, hands down. The alligator was very salty, even for two people who love salt, and we kind of wished that the chili garlic aeoli had been on the side, rather than top of the alligator, so the salty factor could have been adjusted per our own liking.As an entree, we split the special; a crunchy pork belly on top of greens, black eyed peas, and an onion bernaisse ($27). The pork belly was good, but there was very little pork (I know pork belly is fatty, but SOME meat would have been nice to go with the crunchy skin). It was just alright. The greens were really the star of the plate.For dessert, we got the pineapple upside down cake with a lime ie cream and dolce de leche drizzle ($8). This was delicious, and not too heavy. It ended the meal on a positive note.All together, the meal was $83.31, before tax. The oysters and dessert were very good, but everything else was mediocre, especially considering the price. It was definitely ot worth close to a bill after the tip.As for the service-it was also mediocre. The wait staff wear plain black t-shirts and dark jeans and take quite a while to take your order, or even bring you bread.

The oysters were lovely, no doubt - smoky and cooked to perfection. The ribs were just average, dry and a bit stringy and the watermelon pickle was super sweet and didn't really go with the meat, kind of like that sauce Chinese restaurants give you in the takeout bag for your ribs. Honestly, the alligator was kind of gross, four people agreed. The coating is weird, halfway between panko-delicate and Kentucky fried. Not crispy and kind of limp, with a vaguely gummy texture and a flavor we couldn't place, but not in a good, exotic, \"wow, I've never eaten anything quite like this before\" way but in a \"this could be chicken, this could be some kind of tofu\" bewilderment way.Our drinks were very good, we had Tiger Tails (made with tequila) and very good wine.

I wanted to eat 5 more of these plates.Fried boudin- Ok; flavors were \u00a0really good but they were fried too long so they were slightly too oily.Smoked pork ribs- Ick, these were terrible. They were swimming in their own grease and were chewy and not at all tender (and my family owns BBQ joints)Pork cheeks-These were delish!! The meat was so tender and the flavors were incredible!Mushroom salad- Yummy, but the dried lemon slices were extremely bitter, so I had to pick them out of the salad before I finished.This is where the yumminess stopped, in my opinion. The cochon was the best entree, but it wasn't nearly as good as I had expected it to be. It seemed like glorified pulled pork to me. The brisket was not very good; the meat was really tough and chewy, but the horseradish potato salad was pretty good. I had a chicken dish which was extremely overcooked, oily and dry, and the accompaniments (minted peas and other veggies) were cold.

I like oysters but I don't LOVE oysters so when they are really large they tend to freak me out a little. One of the oysters on the plate was gigantic and it was so well seasoned and creamy, I didn't feel the slightest bit weird about it. I thought these were great. We also had the fried alligator which was tossed in a chili sauce. The sauce reminded me a little bit of wing sauce (this isn't a bad thing!) and the meat was super tender. After that we ordered the pork cheeks with corn grits and tomato salad. I wasn't sure what to expect with this one--I have never even seen a pork cheek. These were also really good, tender morsels of meat. This dish was one of my boyfriend's favorite things we ate on our trip to New Orleans and we ate a LOT. For our entree we had the rabbit and dumplings. This was good, but kind of underwhelming compared to the appetizers. Dessert was the pineapple upside down cake with coconut lime sorbet and dulce de leche. This was a great end to the meal! The cake had a really good rustic cornmeal texture and came out warm.

I started with the deviled crab and butter crackers appetizer, which was brought out at the same time as the Arugula salad (which was refreshing after way too much fried food during my stay). The deviled crab was good, but pretty standard fare, while the dressing on the salad was extremely refreshing, and the crispy pig ears a delight. I must say, this was my favorite part of my meal. I then had the rabbit and dumplings for my main meal - the rabbit was succulent and moist, the dumplings didn't do much for me. I ended dinner with the fried apple pie, which reminded my friend and I of an apple fritter (at least in taste). It was still very good as she and I both finished our pies. The rub came with service. Unfortunately it left a bit to be desired. At no point after my friend finished her bourbon sampler, was she asked if she would like anything else to drink. I kept having to refill my own wine glass, since they only came back once to check on that. Unlike the other tables around us, we had to ask for dessert menu, and we weren't asked if we wanted any coffee. the final service straw came when one bite into dessert, the server unceremoniously plopped the check into the middle of the table, without a word and walked away.

Enjoyed the experience overall, with just a few reservations.The interior is an interesting kind of rustic moderne. The booths and tables are in the style of wooden benches, with some very unique lighting illuminating their backs. Overall, however, the place was far too loud and far too dark, so dark that it made it tough to identify the individual elements on my plate.Service was friendly,very knowledgeable, and professional and the meal was well paced.As for the food, we started out with the pig ears and the \"boucherie plate\", which is actually from a confusing menu section. What is the difference between \"boucherie\" and \"small plates\"? And why are they on separate sections of the menu? But I digress. The pig ears were paid. Cut into strips, breaded, and fried they could have been any deep fried Applebee's appetizer. The cane syrup mustard that came with it was fine, but did little to redeem an unremarkable dish. The boucherie plate, basically charcuterie, fared better. It featured hogshead cheese (a delicious headcheese with a wonderful salty, porky essence), fried hog jowls (like crispy bacon, but far too salty to be edible), \"rolled bacon\" (actually cured, similar to prosciutto or pancetta), pork rillette, and tasso ham. All, with the exception of the aforementioned hog jowels, were very good. I sampled the catfish courtbuillion, the pulled pork (inexplicably called the cochon on the menu), the ham hock, and the rabbit stew. The pulled pork was not BBQ style, and was instead incredibly moist and perfectly seasoned. The flavor just melted out of the meat. The cracklins, part of the accompaniments, were dry and did not add a whole lot to the dish. The ham hock, served with sweet potatoes and black eye pea broth (probably mostly ham stock) had a very interesting and pleasing combination of flavors. My rabbit & dumplings, actually a stew, was way over seasoned. The overwhelming spiciness ruined any other flavor it may have had. Once again another case of the meat in a dish being basically unidentifiable. The catfish courtbuillion was the clear star of the night, being just a perfect balance of flavor and texture. It was slightly spicy, but the spiciness was followed by some very full and well developed flavors. Thinking about it now makes me desperately hungry for it.So, overall the experience was a decent one. As another commenter said, the food was just ok. I was expecting great leaps of creativity, but everything was just ok, especially considering the hype around this place. \u00a0Many items were pretty expensive, too, given the ingredients and preparation.

We could really just order a couple of orders of this each time, but there are definitely other menu items that are worth trying as well. They have a number of small plates which allow you to try different things, and they also have full entree portions for order as well. I love the crawfish and green tomato casserole and the crab salad. I'm not a person that typically orders gumbo because my mom makes the best, but I tried it here and thought the shrimp and devilled egg gumbo was fantastic. My fiance loves the oyster and bacon sandwich. Keep in mind the menu is seasonal so some of the items change and aren't always available. All of the sides are delicious--mac and cheese casserole, lima beans, eggplant and shrimp dressing are our favorites. My only slight negative was that the Catfish Court Boullion was just average and I wouldn't be inclined to order it again. Service is always wonderful and the food is always great.

Cochon is definitely known for their delectable and diverse pork dishes, but the rest of the non-pork entrees are excellent as well. The appetizers of braised pork cheeks with sauerkraut cake and the oyster and meat pie were so different and simply wonderful tasting. I wish I remembered the name of what I ordered for my main course. It was something Pork-y, French-y, Louisiana-y sounding and it was TO DIE FOR. I have NEVER had something like this. The outside of this pulled pork mound of excellence was crispy and crunchy, whilst the inside was incredibly moist and rich. Perfect. Easily the best pork I've ever experienced. Ok just to nitpick here: our waiter was just fine, not overly friendly or personable, just a mixture of 'meh' and fine. Whatever. So be it. Similarly, we ordered some sort of spiced carrot cake for dessert which was also just 'meh.'

Tisere, my server took plenty of time describing the house specialties while trying to find out what I was wanted to accomplish in this gastronomical endeavor.

The gumbo was a little atypical in terms of the roux but I loved the combination of black-eyed peas and the soft pork. The bread and hog head cheese was hard to put down too. For entrees, I watched the procession of plates living the kitchen either from the wood burning stove or the grill.

The small plates were good, but nothing you couldn't find at any decent restaurant around the country, or in soooo many other places in the city. \u00a0Then came the large plates, which were simply not good. \u00a0The Louisiana Cochon was dry, overcooked, and so overly salted that it was basically inedible. \u00a0Seriously, this is not an exaggeration. \u00a0Same with the smothered greens, and when we questioned the waitress about the two dishes, there was no attempt to make it right, perhaps switch out the dishes with something that we might enjoy, just a shrug and an off handed comment that the greens are always salty as she disappeared from the table. Really? We know greens are usually salty, we're not food idiots here, can't you take thirty seconds to attempt to show a bit of concern? \u00a0Rabbit and dumplings tasted like a tricked out chicken pot pie --why do people love this dish?? Catfish was overcooked and also dried out. \u00a0Maybe our expectations were too high, or it was just an off night, but with so many other choices of tremendous restaurants in the city, DO NOT be sucked in by the hype -- our experience with mediocre food and bad service makes Cochon one of the most overrated restaurants we have ever dined in.", "Date": "2013-05-20", "Author_Location": "Glendale, CA"}, {"Author": "grace c.", "ReviewID": "hpHW5hemuizYgPx1rufupg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first time in New Orleans and I was ready for a whole weekend of good grub. A bit out of the way, in the warehouse district, this place uses all local ingredients and that in itself garners a plus in my book.

The main attraction consisted of oyster BLT (you'd never imagine it together but it was a great combination), gulf fish (fisherman's style - with scales and bones...fresh and juicy), smoked beef brisket (the moist-est brisket I have EVER had), along with 2 accompaniments, broccoli and rice casserole (this was ok, not as flavorful) and eggplant and shrimp dressing (reminiscent of Indian food).

It's a bustling (definitely need a reservation), modern rustic looking place that oozes good energy. The food also performs - (mostly) authentic Cajun dishes prepared in a modern and highly skilled manner. Perhaps the best thing on the menu is their grits - a very large grind grit that almost has a fresh creamed corn flavor and texture. Their eponymous dish is a long braised pork dish with a few (wish there were more) cracklings on top. The redfish entree is as good as, if not better than anywhere else. For side dishes besides the grits, the green tomato and crawfish is good, not great; smothered collard greens are as expected; and the stewed limas were proclaimed totally authentic by the Cajun ladies sitting next to us. For starters, the fried pig ears are good, but missing the (hoped for) gelatinous chew - likely because they're thinly sliced and covered in too much fry batter. The fried boudin are nice, delicate and very soft meatballs - perhaps a bit too mild in flavor to stand up against the deep fry. Desserts are excellent - take your pick. All critique aside, you couldn't do much better in NOLA than having a meal (or two) at Cochon.

The decor is straight out of Architectural Digest with lots of honed wood and brushed aluminum, but I never let schwanky decor sway my opinion of an eatery's real soul. It's the flavor that matters. Our first order was the night's special: a haystack of heavily spiced and roasted crawfish. The litte mudbugs intimidated one of our party, but the rest of us found them finger-lickin' delectable. Our main dishes and sides arrived so quickly thereafter that we wondered aloud if they'd been pre-made and microwaved. I don't care how they do it, each dish was so good that we all took turns sharing fork-fulls off each plate. Portions were generous enough that we couldn't quite lick our plates. Once again, dessert became out of the question. The final consensus of our gang o' four was that the pork and seafood dishes bested the beef brisket in flavor.

The place was modern and had a nice vibe. I will warn that if you are going here to get suckling pig or pig sliced off the bone, its not on the menu. Yes, there are pork dishes, but I went there thinking we would get some roast suckling pig cuts, or cracklings but what was on the menu was essentially pulled pork (which I could do at home) and some apps (homemade cold cuts and head cheese). I saw some other reviews that had dishes that had much more pig, but I guess not on the night that we went. We ordered wine off the list, but they were out of the two that we ordered which to me is kinda lame. We decided to get the starters and sample as much as we could and since nothing on the main menu really caught our eye. Unfortunately all the dishes came out at once even though we asked it to be one at a time, so it was hard to even find room at the table. The roasted oysters were really good and came baked with a nice spicy sauce. The cold cut sample was good too. The head cheese was speckled with lot of nice head meat and had a good flavor. The homemade mortadella was good and so were the salamis. I think the best thing was the boudin balls. Nicely fried and had nice spice. The pork cheeks were on the dry side and didn't have a ton of flavor. Overall, its a nice place and the food was good but not overwhelming by any means.

Our first experience was very good and because of that we decided to go again on our second trip. To say I was disappointed is not enough. From the beginning the waiter showed no interest in assisting us with the menu even though we asked for help. The menu is very small, last time they had specials, this time none. Nevertheless we had a hard time picking an item. When my wife asked if she could substitute the potatoes for something else the answer was \"absolutely no substitutions\" then as my wife looked at him with an incredulous stare because she cannot eat gluten, the waiter said, \"but you can buy a side\". Really? We have eaten all over in high end to hole in the wall locales and never had an issue. This pretentious attitude is just not acceptable. So as it was our last night in New Orleans and we didn't want to deal with a headache or have our night ruined we just ordered something else. I had the pork which was not only salty, it was dry. And don't let me forget the peanut salad that was the biggest joke, seriously if you call four lettuce leaves with a few peanut halves on top a \"salad\" and slap a $9 dollar price tag on it and are proud of your efforts, you seriously need a reality check. We actually had lunch a few days prior at Cochon Butcher and it was pretty good, at that moment we wished badly we had just walked next door and ordered a sandwich. The most frustrating part is we have planned this trip since August and reservations were made since October. We are not food snobs, we just expect good food and great service. Having a waiter completely ignore you, not ask if you needed more wine or beer and never come once to your table to ask how everything was is just not acceptable.
