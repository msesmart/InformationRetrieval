If there's BBQ being served, I'll give it a try. \u00a0I've been to the well known \"hot spots\" such as Austin, Memphis and Kansas City to little known places for BBQ such as Green Bay - and yes, this place loves up to the hype.First off, you WILL wait in line. There is always a line. \u00a0And yes, the place is small so if you don't like making new friends and/or have personal space issues, this may not be the place for you. \u00a0It's also no frills, it's all about the BBQ here. \u00a0All that being said, it is hands down the best BBQ place in Chicago and would give some of the places I've been to in Dallas, Austin and/or KC a legit run for the money.Brisket, BBQ pork, BBQ turkey, ribs, fries, Mac n cheese and peach cobbler are all amazing.

And no grabbing a table in the interim. They have folks who will try to be polite telling you they'll show you where to sit, but only when your food is ready. \u00a0Inside, maybe seating for \u00a050 at tables for two that can be pushed together, and outside maybe enough for 25 more.The menu is on a blackboard. The prices more than fair for the quality.We tried the chicken, pork (pulled), brisket (chopped), and ribs (St. Louis cut) and the table was divided as to which topped the list... but even the number four choice was better than just good. \u00a0Personally, the chopped brisket was exceptional. Full flavor, just enough fat to keep it moist and chopping the brisket helps avoid those dry, stringy slices you can sometimes get off the end.The ribs had a nice thick coat of rub and were smoked to nearly perftection. Tender but not falling off the bone - always a giveaway that they've been parboiled or baked in advance of the grill. \u00a0 The pulled pork was very good, and the chicken was equally as good. \u00a0Go for a combo plate and you can help but come out with a great meal.Smoque's hand cut french fries are world class; no need to say more. The baked beans were fair to middlin', the slaw was thin sliced cabbage in a vinegar based sauce with thin slices of a red onion; different and better than a lot of them. \u00a0 The mac-n--cheese was a great choice with a crispy top.They have a couple of sauces, and here comes a complaint: one is called a Memphis style sauce (thick , fairly sweet tomato), the other a Carolina sauce which means there's vinegar involved. \u00a0They decide which you'd prefer based on your order; you wouldn't use the Carolina red with chicken... but what they don't do is let you decide how much of either you want to use. \u00a0They put a shot on your order and a little plastic cup with what they think goes well, and you've got to go back and ask (and ask again if you want more) for any extra. \u00a0 Why not put two containers on each table and let folks serve themselves? \u00a0It's got to be cheaper than buying thousands of those little plastic gizmos, and there'd be fewer people trying to get back to the counter.For most true barbecue lovers, the drink of choice is either a cold beer or sweet tea and it's in that department that Smoque misses out on the fifth star. \u00a0Their sweet tea is colored water with not enough flavor to pass the blindfolded taste test. And what's with those three gulp paper cups they provide for your drinks? Having to stand in line for refills (the tea and soft drink dispenser are in a crowded corner) is an unnecessary waste of time (always a long line waiting) and results in the table being tied up longer than necessary. \u00a0Bigger glasses please. \u00a0 The service is self, so there's not much to say about their folks except they're all friendly and eager to help answer questions for first timers. The p;lace is kept clean despite the volume of barbecue lovers who find their way to Pulaski Street.For someone who has spent a lifetime in pursuit of the perfect barbecue (read reviews of 60+ other barbecue joints across the country), I'd have to say while Smoque isn't it... \u00a0it is awfully close. \u00a0Once you've found a parking place and made it inside, stay away from the diluted sweet tea, order extra sauce from the get go, and get set to savor some very good cue.", "Date": "2014-07-11", "Author_Location": "Alpharetta, GA"}, {"Author": "Alejandra O.", "ReviewID": "4aNOyua1ANYQYtBi8R1X4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been to Smoque 3 times. \u00a0Every time I have gone, thankfully lines are not too bad.

Peach Cobbler - 5 Stars, one of the best I have ever had. Good texture and firmness on the peaches. The topping was just right, not overly sweet. Bread Pudding - 5 Stars, thick and rich, not overly done. The only issue was I should have eaten it in the beginning of the meal. It has cooled down by the time we dug in.

Seriously the best BBQ in Chicago. Snowier has been featured on shows like Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.The ribs are great, but the brisket is better than most that I have had in Texas. For those who don't know Texas brisket, just think about the most tender, juiciest beef with a good smoke flavor. The bark (or crust) is good enough to be served as a dish by itself. It is juicy, fatty, perfectly crusted goodness.If you get the ribs, don't settle for the baby backs (which are still tasty). The Kansas City style ribs have more meaty, BBQ flavor. Why settle for less when you can have more?The pulled pork is also very good. It's like a North Carolina style pulled pork, but without as much clear, vinegar sauce. I like my NC BBQ very vinegary and sweet. The red sauce that Smoque uses is good but not as authentic.The sides are also extraordinary. I esp. like the mac and cheese, which are served in individual tins--creamy, cheesy goodness in a cup. Their beans are also great. They use leftover beef brisket in the beans for extra flavor, texture, and goodness.They have a couple of BBQ sauces, one for the pulled pork and one for everything else. Their house sauce is sweet with a hint of cola (trust me it's good).Smoque was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, in one of the earliest seasons. It lives up to its reputation.

We got the side salad, Texas sausage, pulled pork, sliced brisket, and a selection of sides (fries, mac and cheese, brisket chili, and corn bread). I have to say that the side salad was both huge and delicious. I also liked the Texas sausage and the mac and cheese and corn bread. But neither of the other two main dishes had much flavor and I've definitely had better elsewhere.

The fries were good, but could use some salt.The macaroni was good, but the portion is too small. I don't like that it's in an aluminum container, because you can't microwave it. If you don't eat it while it is hot, you have to turn on the oven, unless you want to lose most of it by trying to spoon it out onto a plate.Others had the pulled pork. I don't like pork, but theirs isn't porky. The baked beans were OK. They had a bread pudding special. It was good, I never had bread pudding before.

Though this doesn't even come close to the tastes of that city, I'm glad I visited Smoque as it's been on the list for some time.The good - the mac and cheese. \u00a0I'm the pickiest person when it comes to mac and cheese to the point that I don't care for the way most restaurants make this childhood staple. Smoque's version ironically did me just right. The cole slaw was also nicely flavored and cut through the fattiness on the rest of my plate. The fries were a favorite of mine. \u00a0Thicker fries go well with BBQ and I was happy with what I received. On a side note... Smoque gets points for presentation as well if you are into taking pictures of your food. But I did like the music and the overall sloppiness left on my hands and face which makes me feel like I just had BBQ.The bad - the brisket. It was cooked too long or too high resulting in a brisket that practically fell apart like a pot roast. I was hoping for a little more texture. \u00a0Also, the crust on the brisket slid right off which was due to the fat underneath. A bit weird for me. \u00a0I didn't care for the sauce much either. There was a flavor in the sauce that made me pass on the extra provided. \u00a0The ribs were also very tough.

The BBQ beans were an excellent side choice, as was the mac & cheese. The cole slaw was not to my liking, as I prefer a creamier base; theirs is in a vinegar base.

When graded on a curve, I have no choice but to ding you.Smoque is hailed as the reigning champion of Chicago barbecue. I've yet to eat other contenders like Lillie's Q or Chicago Q, so my review of Smoque is strictly in silo with my Texan (re: better) and other BBQ experiences.Smoque's brisket looks the part. Squint and it doesn't look unlike an offering from Austin's own world famous Franklin BBQ. The char looks legitimate, the smoke ring is present, and the meat looks fall-off-the-metaphoric-bone worthy. Wherein lies the rub? In the taste. Smoque's brisket is by no means dry; it just lacks the requisite flavor.Smoque does take great care to make the best brisket they possible can make. Take a moment to read its BBQ manifesto, and it's clear that they are trying to emulate Hill Country 'cue with its brisket. Smoque even imports its sausage from a famous Texas family, the Mikeskas (I'd stop by the Columbus post all the time en route from Houston to Austin).As for the more near and dear to Chicago style, the pulled pork and ribs, I had the great misfortune of stopping by the nothing-short-of-amazing Pappy's Smokehouse in St. Louis on my drive up from Texas to Chicago. Smoque's ribs and pulled pork are both good; Pappy's is better.At this point, it's hurting me to give Smoque a three-star rating, since its BBQ is really tasty and I definitely plan to go back again.

Since then there have been a handful of very good BBQ spots that have been opening up in neighboring parts of the city, but this is still my go-to spot when I want great BBQ. My standard orders are usually brisket or St Louis ribs (sooo good!). The brisket is so tender that when you try to pick up a slice with your fork, it will fall apart if you don't get it into your mouth quickly enough. And friends that I have gone with also speak fondly of their pulled pork (personally I have never tried it), and when I feel like something else besides red meat, I go for their chicken. I know most people might think, \"Chicken? Really? If I'm going to get BBQ, I'm getting red meat.\" Well I've been here enough to want to change it up from time to time, and their chicken is EXCELLENT. Easily some of the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I have even tasted.They also have pretty tasty sides. I'll start with their 'slaw. If you order a plate or sandwich, the 'slaw comes with it. Personally I think creamy 'slaws are disgusting, and until I went to Smoque I thought \"creamy\" was the only type of 'slaw out there. Smoque's 'slaw is vinegar based and is pretty damn amazing. Whenever I go, I get a large container to go, to have as a side with my lunches. Their beans, mac n'cheese and fries are all must tries as well. I'm not a fan off their cornbread, but I know some that are; and from what I hear their peach cobbler is pretty damn tasty as well. I've never had it, because by the time \"dessert\" enters my mind, I am stuffed! I will say that if you're thinking of carrying out, you may want to have realistic expectations. I've carried out 3-4 times and EVERY single time, the meat is too rare on the brisket. I feel like they may just save the rarer stuff for the to-go orders since most people don't check their food until they get home. I'm not say that's 100% the case, but it's hard for me to believe that my luck is THAT bad. That being said, I've never been any less than absolutely satisfied, when I dine in... hence the 5 star rating.

A little small for the portion I thought, but it's probably a good thing since I had so much food anyways. Sleeper side pick #2 : Peach Cobbler.

Coleslaw: I grew up seeing my parents eat KFC coleslaw and having tried it once, completely turned me off from it. Smoque BBQ's coleslaw was surprisingly good. I ended up combining it with the brisket and the contrasting flavors blended well. Apparently this is how they do it in the South? Maybe I'm wrong, but it was delicious.Baby Back Ribs: My friends and I split a half slab and it was delicious as well. At some point the brisket and the ribs tasted the same.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.The MeatBaby back Ribs: The center of my BBQ universe. \u00a0These did not dissapoint. \u00a0The meat was tender and came of the bone easily, but is was easy to detect the smoke that had kissed this meat. \u00a0They were delicious and I was sucking bones. \u00a0I gave the bones to a co worker for his dogs. \u00a0I'm sure they also liked them. \u00a0ASt. Louis Ribs: \u00a0Even better than the baby back ribs. \u00a0Meaty, tender well seasoned. \u00a0I am a fan. \u00a0A+Pulled Pork: \u00a0Good, but not as good as I was expecting from a place like this. \u00a0The same as pulled pork you can get anywhere. CBrisket: The only brisket I've had that was better than this was in Houston. \u00a0Amazing. Tender, moist and full of flavor. \u00a0Get this, even if you usually don't eat brisket. \u00a0A+Texas Sausage: very good with a little bit of spice. \u00a0Way better than I was expecting, but not the star of the show. BMac & Cheese : While the serving size is small, the mac & cheese is creamy and tasty, baked so that there is some nice crust on the top to add texture. \u00a0As a mac & cheese lover, I can't give it an A, but it provides a nice balance for the sauces and well seasoned meat. BBaked Beans: There is a unique taste to them. They are a little sweeter than I am used to and seem as if wine or Worcestershire was used. Another small serving, but good. \u00a0My girl was not a fan, but I was. This is my Yelp not hers, so there. \u00a0B+Fries: \u00a0Hot and crispy, but nothing to slap your mother over. \u00a0Make sure you eat them fresh, they won't handle travel well. BThe meat here is wonderful, and the sides are pretty good, if small. \u00a0A little pricey but well worth it if you want real Southern style, smoked BBQ.

Best ribs and best brisket (chopped)! Also most low-key and affordable.You know when you have an idea of what kind of BBQ you like, but never quite find it? Well, that's the way it was for me before I visited Smoque. I've tasted many delicious ribs lot of places, but I finally had the ribs I've always known were out there somewhere, right here at Smoque. FANTASTIC!Our mini crawl was coming to a stop with our bellies being pretty full by the time we arrived here. We were able to park just down the street (for free, no less), and were happy to see no line on this sunny summer Saturday at about 4 pm. We walked in and right up to the counter, only one person ahead of us, and lots of seating. Yay!We got a combo for $22 of 2 half racks of ribs (1 St. Louis, 1 baby back), 2 sides (peach cobbler and BBQ beans) and it comes with coleslaw as well. To that we added \"a taste\" of sausage and of chopped brisket, for an additional $3 each. So, for $28, we really got quite a lot- and took leftovers home! Next time, I'd really want to try the chicken quarter. WOW, did that look phenomenal!I chose the chopped brisket based on Meghan H's review that it was basically burnt ends- my favorite, and oh my, I'm glad I did. They were juicy, succulent, full of flavor and just outstanding. It really does compare well to burnt ends. Great tip Meghan, otherwise I might have waited til another time to try. It is making me salivate right now, actually. :-)~ The sausage we had was good, but I felt it tasted better the next day.But, the show stopper for me, was without a doubt the baby back ribs! They are what I've been looking for my whole BBQ life. The blackened crust was devine, the meat was not quite fall off the bone, it was juicy, smoky, flavorful, a lil spicy- everything ribs should be, and what you expect them to taste like when you find yourself watching a BBQ cook-off on the Food Network for one too many hours on a sad Thursday night.It was really hard to discern the better of the two, but the baby back just slightly edged out the STL ribs. Both were outstanding. Just as a note, my husband liked these second best for the crawl, as he said they tasted a bit of liquid smoke. Apparently, either he was high, or I'm totally ok with that. Either way, I'm so happy I know where I am getting ribs from now on. The sides were just ok for us, tho I did really like those BBQ beans, and my 2 bites of the cobbler. But this was most definitely all about the meat, baby. Overall, this is a more \"spill-friendly\" environment I'd be comfortable with taking kids to, and again, the most affordable of the three today. One might even say it was a tad grimy, a real down-home kinda place.

Sadly, we had waited in line just to get to that point.

It's not table service, in other words. It's counter service. And for these prices, I'd like to have a better dining experience.That being said, the food is very good. Flavors are excellent. Why, however, has food been received cold or room temperature, if it's coming from the staff to me? I don't know, but about 1/3 of the time, that's happened. I will say, the staff is friendly even as they rush people from one position to the next.

I was afraid he was gonna tell me they were closed, but when I asked, 'Are y'all still open?' he smiled and opened a hand toward the counter.I stepped up and ordered a pulled pork sandwich a la carte and a brisket platter entree with french fries and peach cobbler as my two sides. I was even offered, \"For here, or to go?' I ordered carry-out and sat down to wait. My number was called and I was handed a bag full of piping hot food that smelled delicious. When I got to the car I noticed it wasn't even 9 o'clock yet. Wow, quick service.I couldn't help but sample the fries on the way home and they were sooo good!When I got home and ate my meal, it was all I could have asked for, and more. The meat was perfectly tender. If you want sauce on your brisket you'll have to pour it on, because it's too tender to dip. The slow-cooked brisket tasted similar to that my grandma used to make. I really enjoyed it. I tried a piece of the pulled pork sandwich, and it, too, was really tasty. I like that they put the sauce on the side. I'm a dipper, I love sauces, but the meat is just as delicious without it. The entree also came with a side of slaw which is vinegar based and made with fresh cabbage.The peach cobbler was really flavorful and I like how it was served in an individual tin, and that it was warm. I would add a little more crust and/or almonds to the topping, so it' s a little thicker, but that dessert was absolutely nothing to complain about!I was in the restaurant just a few minutes before they closed as I awaited my carryout order, and while there were loads of customers still eating at the tables and a bunch of workers moving about, it didn't have a stressful atmosphere at all. The people who work there all had super friendly demeanors and the food I was served was hot and delicious.Everything I ordered at Smoque tonight was fresh and tasty and I recommend this restaurant highly if you're in the mood for some good BBQ and southern style comfort food.

Smoque does that. When people talk about Chicago, lots of people mention the hot dogs or the deep dish, but they should really be talking about the BBQ. Food here is served as ala cart items or you can order meat with 2 sides and slaw. When you enter, you order and pay at the counter, but then they seat you and bring the food to you. \u00a0The Meats:BBQ Brisket: This was one of the most tender and juicy cuts of meat I have ever had. In combination with the smokey char on the outside, you can tell that this meat had been smoked for no less than 14 hr. After 14 hrs this meet was so soft and tender on the inside that you thought it had been watching nothing but adorable puppies forever. Ribs: If you are a fan of getting messy when you eat BBQ, don't miss this treat. The meat literally melts off the bone. It has a Memphis style dry rub that really makes the ribs very savory with just a little bit of sweetness from the BBQ sauce. I did not want to use the wet naps afterwards, because i wanted to lick all the sauce off my fingers.The Sides:mac and cheese: This mac and cheese was melty & rich and a great complement to the savory pile of meat. Slaw: Okay, I know that slaw might be an after thought for you. \u00a0You think it's something that people throw at you because its easy to make, but I really liked their slaw. It was light and tangy and not to heavy.

The wait was roughly ~30 min to 1hr to order. Upon ordering, we were escorted to a table that was held for us by the hostess (or something similar to). Their food arrived on a metal tray.This place is probably as good as BBQ gets in Chicago (and I'm a bit disappointed given Chicago has such wonderful food/restaurants/eateries). It's definitely not a top-tier BBQ place. The ribs, brisket, and pulled pork were OK, but could be quite dry and overcooked. The cole slaw was rather enjoyable with a vinegar-based dressing (I'm accustomed to mayonnaise being from the south). The brisket chili was nothing special, with the brisket not adding much to the party. The menu is also more pricey than I'm accustomed to paying for BBQ, but this isn't a large point given it's in/near Chicago. I also found it odd how the owner (or who I presumed to be the owner) is sort of on watch over his customers. His interactions seemed a bit odd/strange, acting almost like a statue in the corner. If an owner is out on the dining floor, I'm usually accustomed to seeing him ask how things are going/how the food is. Instead he was just sort of...there... Also not a fan of the seating method, but I guess they need to sort people when there's a line snaking out the door. With the price I paid, I would've preferred eating elsewhere as Chicago has a huge HUGE selection of places to eat. Smoque will satisfy the BBQ itch, but you'll need to go elsewhere for really REALLY good BBQ. Rewards on their wall also seem to reflect this, as I don't recall seeing anything that was non-Chicago awarded.This is probably not the most valid point, but if you've got a car and a day, go to Pappy's in St. Louis.

The brisket and pulled pork were amazing too, both being flavorful and smoky, but didn't quite shine like the ribs. Out of the sides, the brisket chili was disappointing. The flavors were muddled and needed more seasoning. The fries were crispy and hot -- there's something about eating them out of a grease-soaked brown paper bag that makes that much more appetizing.

As other reviewers have said, their seating system works when the place is packed because they take your name at the door and the # of ppl in your party. And you will get seated by the time you're done ordering. Don't fret. As for the BBQ, I decided on the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwich option, which I got half pulled pork and chopped brisket. Both were amazingly flavorful and juicy, and had a good amount of fatty juice that made it extra tasty. I also sampled the sliced brisket which is truly a work of art, gleaming pink meat with a beautiful charred black outside. Sides: I tried the mac and cheese (delicious), cornbread (pretty good), bbq beans (smoky, sweet and delicious), chili (just fine), fries (pretty good), cole slaw is sliced thin and vinegary (perfect compliment to the bbq). Sauces: Definitely prefer the spicy sauce, it is thicker, sweeter, and bolder. The Carolina sauce is more watery and vinegary.

I decided to go big and get this with 2 sides and a extra side of cornbread and a side of some bread pudding concoction they were serving up. The ribs were some of the best I've ever had and it was indeed a full rack. Kinda looked like two racks of ribs stacked on top of each other to be honest. The meals come out on aluminum serving trays and we had some much food they had to bring out a extra tray for our sides. Needless to say, cupid himself would have fallen in love with this meal. For the sides I had some cornbread and brisket chili and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was awesome as well as the brisket chili. The cornbread was good but they serve up the sides in little aluminum cupcake sized containers which are fine for most of the sides they have here but could be a little more generous when it comes to the cornbread. Anyways, they also give you plenty of extra BBQ sauce on the side for dipping and it is sweet, salty, spicy and everything you'd want for a BBQ sauce.

My comments are based on three visits. Anyone can accidentally knock a brisket out of the park just as Darwin Barney accidentally hit six balls out of the park this year. First suggestion. Toss the chicken and sausage off the menu. It has no place at a barbecue joint. I remember ordering my first hot dog with ketchup in Chicago. No one told me different. Down South, they would be even less polite. \"Did you say chicken, sir?\" \"If so, you have about 3O seconds to leave before my angry uncle put a brick bat upside your head and makes your eyes crossed.\" As for the sausage, sell 'em out of a hot water, hot dog stand. Common trash. Do the O'Mally's \u00a0live with the Vanderbilt's?RIBS: wash yo hands because they so good, you'll smack yo mama. Excellent dry rub that isn't too salty like 98 percent of ribs. Seriously slow cooked as they must be. How can one tell? Put your plastic silverware down and pick it up like you're supposed to. Hold it by one end. Does it seem top heavy because it leans and perhaps even cracks and breaks in two. Of great importance, of all meats ribs are the easiest to cheat on. From this point forward, look at the fat on the exterior and between bones. Should be about 2O percent max. Score 9BRISKET: For the most part, brisket is a fairly lean piece of meat. It is the toughest to tenderize because it's the thickest. If the middle is warm and moist with a black/brown, but not burned crust on top that is seasoned in a highly pleasing manner, someones doing something right. Here's a test for great seasoning. Scrape a little off with your knife and hold it on your tongue. Sure, salt is an ingredient, if it seems to be the largest ingredient, your eating at a poser's restaurant. I'm not a big brisket eater and often rely on what others say. I'd like to take my buddy Steve here once a week and order him brisket. It's the only time he don't constantly run that damn mouth of his. Score 8The sport of kings: Horse racing. The meat of his heirs: PULLED PORK. So Smoque, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. You and your pulled pork \u00a0can go toe-to-toe with anyone, anywhere, anytime. I admit, I was surprised and humbled by the people who would attempt such a dish above Interstate 4O. That stuff will make you want to fist fight a rude man just because everything else is right with the planet while enjoying meat that is of varying color which is normal. Yes, there can be a bit of grease. Guess what, take that away and you got beef jerky. It's like comparing a fillet with sirloin. Marbled means magnifique. Smoque's had less grease than any PP I've tasted. That means when the pork is pulled, they actually may discriminate against a few pieces. To come in Smoque's and not order PP is like going into Mike Ditka's and not eating the veal chop. The knowing chaps and chapettes \u00a0give each other a wink. All seven judges concur, even the contrarian Bulgarian judge. This PP is a 1O.* CORN BREAD preference is like having a bias for a Ford F-15 or a Chevy Silverado. Regardless, you should wear a bag on your head if you don't eat cornbread with your barbecue. That sounds mean, but it's true. I like CB slightly sweet and crumbly without pieces of corn which is just plain nasty. ** PEACH COBBLER has somehow become a custom at a barbecue joint. It's tough to pull off. Peach season is 1O weeks long and even then, why fool with fresh because your customers are used to, and want, what you have been serving. I'm addicted to sugar so I have to have desert. My peach cobbler provided the strongest memories of Smoque. The line was backed out the door. I sort of stuck my head over the stainless steel into the cutting area of the kitchen. I shouldn't have done it, but I asked the cook if there was a way to get desert \u00a0without going to the back of that line. In two seconds, he produced the peach cobbler and said to pay later. The peaches were a four. The warmth was an 8 and the crust was a shocking 1O. You'll never guess one of the ingredients of peach cobbler. Butter. Butter is a food group, but that's for another time.

If I hadn't gotten sick, I'd give this place three stars, but anywhere that makes me sick pretty much has to get one star in my opinion.Edit: I'm going to put two stars back for excellent customer service (the rating I would've given the place if I hadn't felt sick after eating there). Barry wrote me today asking for a chance to make this right and comp my order. I'm willing to do so, to see if I like some of the other items on the menu and in the hopes that this bad experience was an isolated incident.

Yes, it's not convenient to get to, but with some spare time, a bus (or cab), you can get there without one.Let me just say, this BBQ was damn amazing in my book.I got a platter of sliced brisket and pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese, cornbread and sample of the KC style ribs.My meal was amazing. The sauce was excellent, pork was perfectly cooked and tender, brisket had very little fat and was just fall apart cooked. I cannot rave about this enough. Literally, I wanted to make inappropriate noises out loud because it was so tasty.The mac and cheese was good but very rich. Glad it was in a small cup, but still worthwhile to try if you're a fan.The coleslaw was also good, but not my favorite. However, my dad, who loves cole slaw, raved about it, so there you go. He also got the side of the BBQ beans which he loved and from my taste, I was impressed too. Very smokey flavor that was really nice with the beans.The only thing that missed the mark for me was the ribs. Maybe it was because of the smaller portion, but the KC style ribs were tough and difficult to eat. We had to cut the bones apart to get to the meat. But dad took a rack of the Baby Back ones home and said they were great, so maybe I just got a bum sample.I even went BACK inside to get food to take home, which I'm enjoying as I write this.

I was really looking forward to trying a few things out after hearing so many positive reviews. We ordered a full slab of St Louis ribs, chopped beef sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. We arrived early, probably around 4:30 and the tables were already full with a line of people still waiting to order. I was worried we wouldn't be able to sit but as soon as we got in line an employee asked if we needed a table and reassured us one would be ready as soon as we had our food. Another concern I had was that I didn't pick up any of that sweet hickory smoke in the air that I would expect at a real BBQ joint.The wait wasn't bad and we did get the table as promised. Now to the food. I really appreciate good BBQ and the exterior appearance of the ribs was excellent. Upon cutting the bones apart however there was no pink smoke ring at all. The meat was gray. That was pretty disappointing. Although the ribs looked good and smoked from the dark brown/black exterior, they really lacked the soul of a true BBQ rib. The meat was tender and fairly juicy so not a total disappointment.My wife had a chopped beef brisket sandwich, which was also good but not great. My 18 year old son had a pulled pork sandwich which he said was as good as the ones I make at home. That's either a stellar endorsement or a slap in the face.The sides were the fresh cut fries, the best of the sides, cole slaw, which had way to much onion in it, mac and cheese, which was also good but not great, and the beans which were a close second to the fries.Overall I'd rate our meal at 2.5 stars based on the service.

I was recently in the area and wanted to try it out due to their popularity. I needed to see what the hype was all about!When we walked in the door, we were greeted by a packed house. We wanted to sit inside so I quickly looked around for an empty table but were soon told that once we placed our order, we would be directed to a table. After viewing all of the choices, we settled on pulled pork. The hype is true...their pulled pork was amazing. They drizzle a bit of BBQ sauce over the pork and they also provide a side of additional BBQ sauce. We also got a side of coleslaw and fries. The coleslaw was probably the best I ever had. It wasn't creamy or sour at all (I find most coleslaw to be this way). It almost tasted like it was tossed in Italian dressing, sooooo good! The fries were also perfect...warm, super crisp and seasoned well. One side order of fries was pretty large so you might want to split with someone.The place does get pretty crowded, but their ordering/seating method works and is very organized. There was someone always walking around clearing tables of trays and then cleaning the table for the next guests. They also provide ample wet-naps to wipe away the sticky mess that is all over your fingers...and possibly face?The parking situation can be a bit difficult. There is street parking and a small back lot that is available only during certain days/hours.

Even better with a little Carolina style barbeque sauce which they do so well. -St. Louis Ribs: Incredibly meaty. Usually I don't like ribs very much because they are too greasy and fatty. Smoque uses a dry rub which is delicious and the ribs are very lean.-Mac & Cheese: Indulgently rich, with a nice crunchy topping of bread crumbs.-Baked beans: The best baked beans I've had in a long time. Little bits of brisket and heavy smoke flavor are balanced by the deep sweetness of caramelized sugars.-Brisket chili: This is the only item I tried that was not amazing. Not to say it was bad, it just wasn't as good as everything else. Next time I visit, I will opt for something else.Overall, this place is awesome and worth all the hype, and then some.

Every container had the perfect amount of bread crumbs toasted on top. The peach cobbler was also fantastic. The crust was one of the best ever. I only wish I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream to put on top. Maybe management will add this for a summer treat. The Cole slaw was also very fresh tasting. I loved that it was not drenched in mayo but seemed to be vinegar based.While we were eating my wife told me to look over my left shoulder. And there was guy hanging on the wall starring at me. Really? Why is he everywhere in Chicago? This is starting to get a little ridiculous. He should just move here and open a restaurant.As we were leaving at 11:50am, a huge line started to form. We had beaten the lunch crowd. I also got to see Carlos in action. He not only welcomes guests and cleans tables but he is the enforcer too. Some guy was trying to save a table even though his party was at the back of the line. He very diplomatically informed the guy that he had to get others seated who were in front. I love that!!! Good for you Smoque for defending the rights of the hungry people needing a spot to eat. You have got this down to a science.Some side notes...the neighbors do not like you and your cars. They have giant professional signs in the street informing you to not park in front of there houses. I found it kind of funny but understood. It only told me that the food was so good that people will risk there car for an amazing meal.I loved Smoque BBQ...it was one of the better BBQ's I've had.

Because I ate, ate and then ate some more. First of all, I think you'd be hard-pressed to walk into this joint at a time it isn't busy. On a Sunday afternoon around 4, the restaurant was full with a growing line. There's communal seating, which definitely helps speed things along. As we placed our order, our seats were pointed out to us. Within 10 minutes, our order number was called and we entered BBQ heaven.I had the pulled pork platter, which is basically a heaping pile of juicy, tender meat which I topped with the super vinegar-y cole slaw. The acidity of the cool slaw really balanced out the smoky flavors of the meat. The platter also comes with two additional sides-- albeit small, both the cornbread and peach cobbler pack a tasty punch.The sad part is that I could have kept eating after my mound of food disappeared! Luckily, my dining partner didn't judge and was kind enough to let me sample his divine brisket which was also soon gone, baby, gone.I still prefer Honky Tonk as I like their seating better but Smoque is a bit more accessible to me and let's face it, also rather delicious.

I placed an order for a 6:30 pickup on Friday night so I wouldn't have to wait in the line from hell. I arrived at exactly 6:30 and my food was ready. So far, so good. Unfortunately Smoque only has one register and I had to wait for a good five minutes for my order to be rung up...meanwhile my food is getting cold. I also had a $10 A La Card to be deducted from the final total of my order. I didn't know that giving them the $10 A La Card would cause all kinds of problems. Apparently a manager had to come over to handle the transaction which took additional time and then caused everyone behind me to wait since they only have the one register. My debit card was charged; I thought the amount still seemed high after the discount was applied but after being there so long, I just wanted to get the hell outta dodge. I got in my car and then looked at my receipt and it turns out I was given a discount of 10%, not $10, so I was shorted over $6. I debated dealing with it later but then figured it would be more of a hassle, so I did a questionably legal U-turn on Pulaski, re-parked, and went back in, fighting my way through the crowd. The girl that handled my food order (not the cashier) saw me and asked if something was missing from my order so I told her no and clarified that I was overcharged. She told me the cashier could help me when she was done with the current transaction she was ringing. So again I had to wait. The girl (pretty much the only bright spot) asked me if I wanted some chili while I was waiting \"because it seems like this has been one huge pain in the neck for you.\" I acknowledged my annoyance but declined the chili, but I thought it was a nice gesture on her part. Again, the manager had to come back to deal with my transaction, which took another five minutes. Why they couldn't have just handed me $6 and change in cash and deal with sorting out THEIR error later instead of making me wait, I have no idea. They re-ran my credit card for the reduced amount but of course since it was on my debit card, the pending charge is still the higher amount until the final processing. I received no apology or acknowledgment of the hassle (other than the girl who gave me my food) from the cashier or the manager so I found that to be off-putting. I can't think I'm the first person to use an A La Card so they should know how to handle these transactions by now and they should also think about getting a second register to speed up the process for their customers. And of course because it took me so long at Smoque all of my food was cold by the time I got home.

Out of all their meat options, the ribs are the most notable. Both the St. Louis, which are larger and meatier, or the baby back, which are leaner and smaller, are fantastic, and hold up well with the best from Texas or Alabama. The rub is great, the smoke flavor is excellent, and the meat is obviously of very high quality.The brisket, either chopped or sliced, and the pulled pork, are both excellent as well. The meat is lean, which may be why some reviewers find it dry. It's also why I choose the ribs over the brisket and pulled pork every time. The Texas sausage and the chicken, which I've only had in the salad, are also very, very good.The sauces are excellent. Unlike traditional Chicago barbecue, the meat is the main player here, and the sauces do not dominate the flavor. That said, both the rib sauce and the pulled pork sauce are excellent.The cole slaw is vinegary and complements the meat quite well. It is one of my favorite parts of the meal.As for the other sides, my favorites are the brisket chili (which they don't always have), the baked beans, and the fries. The mac and cheese is also good.The place is a bit cramped, and their system for organizing who sits when is effective and charming. However, I have not sat down to eat at Smoque for some time, preferring instead to phone in my order and skip the occasionally long line. It also is not a place to linger, unless you want to heartlessly deny barbecue goodness to the people in line.They also do catering, and are partly responsible for my happiest birthday party ever.I love barbecue.

Keep your friends close and your foodie friends closer.Nestled on a street lined with small businesses and residential homes, the brick building stood out with the name painted right on it.

One wall held a huge chalk board with the menu. I didn't have to look far before deciding on a 1/2 slab of baby back ribs with 2 sides for about $14. I originally chose mac and cheese and coleslaw as my sides, but happily found out that the meal already came with slaw and so I ecstatically selected cornbread. Tears almost came to my eyes as I realized they served Coke. After being at multiple places in the city, I was beginning to think the entire state of Illinois only served Pepsi. But there is was, a self-serve fountain soda machine with Coke clearly written on the side. Some guy told us to order our food first and he would put together a table for our party of 5. The entire place probably only seated about 25 or 30 people. We were seated by the window, right next to the counter where the food came out. We probably waited about 10 minutes, maybe less before our orders were called. You help yourself to plastic utensils and there are plenty of napkin dispensers on the tables. Important detail: the napkins came out from the top so they were easy to pull with your bbq-laden hands. Very important to have easy access to napkins.Anyway, the ribs were flavorful, juicy and fell off the bone. They give you extra sauce and it was probably the best BBQ sauce I've ever had. I wanted to stick a straw into it and drink it. The cornbread was so warm, the crust was perfect and the bread was moist. It and the mac and cheese, so cheesy, so yummy, both came in these little aluminum containers that were the perfect size. Anymore and it would've been overkill. The slaw was vinegar-based, not mayo-based, so it was interesting and different, but in a great way. For 5 people, it was only about $70.Others at the table got brisket (thumbs up) and someone got the fries, which came in a mini brown bag that soon became grease-soaked. They were regular-sized fries, just simple tossed in like salt and pepper, but still had the skin on. And they were fried to perfection. As we finished one by one, some guy came by and took away some of our trays for us.As we stood up to leave, my colleague who ordered the fries put it on his tray. I panicked. Me: \"Are you going to throw those away??!\" Him: \"Well, yeah.\" Me: \"Are you crazy? I'll take them to go and eat them in the car.\"So he handed me the bag, I took some napkins and wrapped the bottom, and took them with me.

They do have a parking lot behind them (only during the off hours of another business, so after 5:30). \u00a0We found a spot, but the lot was nearly full. \u00a0There was a guy outside in an orange vest that they had hired to deal with helping people park in the right areas. \u00a0The street had some street parking but other places were zoned, and I overheard him telling someone else they had hired him because some crazy old woman was taking pictures of all the cars that parked in the wrong place. \u00a0It's nice of them to hire someone, I know most places would just not worry about it and let the customer worry about being towed.I don't know who rated this 1 $, I don't think it's possible to eat for under $10. \u00a0The rib meals are $18-19. \u00a0If you order the cheapest thing, which is probably one of the sandwiches, it would still be more than $10 once you add drink and tax.We went with ribs in mind, but it did seem like the brisket and pulled pork sandwichers were a lot more popular (by far). \u00a0They looked really delicious, I want to go back and try the brisket.", "Date": "2007-05-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "MELEK L.", "ReviewID": "f5oy7TM6Qvz0ekwR5JALSA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you don't give Smoque 5 stars, you are ridiculous!Yes the line was out the door when we arrived at 8pm on Thursday, but I thought it moved rather quickly and they even have reading materials located at the door.

I ordered take out for me and my roommate last night. The following is a synopsis of what we ordered and what went horribly wrong.Roomie's Order:Brisket Platter - Not much flavor. Not much meat (won't feed a big burly man). Plus side is that it was tender.BBQ sauce on the side - VINEGARY or something. It smelled bad and tasted bitter. Blah.Fries - Best part of the meal. Still weren't that great, though.Mac n Cheese - Small muffin cup sized portion. Tasted a bit eggy.Coleslaw - VINEGARY again. WTF is it with the Heinz up in here? Ick.My Order:Pulled Pork Sandwich - I would have thought this was chicken. No flavor beyond the bread. Put my own Baby Ray's BBQ sauce but could not salvage the sammich.Fries - see above.Coleslaw - see above.This does NOT compare to Fat Willy's. Fat Willy's has great sauces and their coleslaw is distinctive (I love the cilantro in it). Also, FW has steak fries, which kick Smoque's ash.I will also say that neither FW nor Smoque compares to Famous Dave's, which can be found in/near North Riverside.I will not be eating at Smoque again. It was disappointing. I wasn't expecting Carson's Ribs but hey... it's a bit pricey for getting bland food. DISCLAIMER: Portage Park restaurants get 4 and 5 stars all the time like they are government cheese. I believe this is due to the niceness of the residents of this area. The sad truth is that Portage Park has very few dining options that will make you salivate. Do not believe all the superb ratings. I would go by the worst review of any given place.

Now there are a whole slew of bbq joints, but Smoque takes the cake.Pulled Pork: perfect mix of crisp, chewy bark and tender meat.Brisket: fuckable. The brisket is fuckable.Mac n' cheese: Crisp top, gooey inside, strong cheese, not overcooked pasta. Awesome.Slaw: God I love that there is a place in Chicago that doesn't ruin its slaw with the world's worst condiment. Also, it's healthy! (not that anything else here is, but you don't go to Smoque to please your Weight Watchers guru).BBQ beans: So. damn. tasty. Bits of brisket in the beans, enough onions and spices to offset the delicious sweetness. Did I mention that there is chopped brisket in the beans?Brisket chili: A special that I've had the last two times here- hopefully it will become a permanent menu fixture. Personally I prefer pinto beans to the large kidney beans that populate this chili, but the brisket is so good you kind of forget that you are eating chili and not just foraging for meat gold.Fries: The reason I give this place a 4.5 and not 5. Okay, they're pretty good fries, but if you're gonna go to the trouble of eating one of the most unhealthy things on the planet, why not season it up a bit? I like that there are places popping like Edzo's Burger Shack that doll up the fries. But maybe it's just that I don't really see the point in plain fries...Sauces: The house BBQ sauce is thin, sweet and vinegary: It's not a North Carolina style sauce, but more similar to that then what you'll find in a bottle of Baby Ray's.-The other sauce (is it called Memphis?) is what I usually go for. This is what uppity food connoisseurs hate, and what most midwesterners love: A sauce that is thick, sweet, and full of deep, peppery flavors. People say that this stuff masks the BBQ, but I would beg to differ: Is it not possible that creating the perfect BBQ sauce to complement your meat is just as high an art as creating a good piece of BBQ-ed meat? All I know is that when I lather my brisket in this stuff, I taste both the meat and the sauce, and it is a match made in heaven.Line: I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes and usually go at prime dinner hours.Dining area: It is what it is- this is a BBQ joint, you pay BBQ prices, picnic tables are okay by me.

You have GOT to go!!Let me give you a few logistics before I talk about the crazy good food. First, you need to BYOB, so go by Trader Joe's or Binny's or Whole Foods and buy beer. Get a good micro-brew because this place deserves it. Second, go EARLY! They sell out. Having been there many, many times, I can tell you that they sell out often of the good stuff. Third, don't let the line scare you. They move that line pretty quick. Yes, the darn line goes out the door and down the block sometimes, and, while I hate waiting, I always beg my hubby to let us stand in this line. Even in the winter, and if you knew how much I hate, hate, hate the Chi-town winters, you would understand what a sacrifice that is for me. The place will usually be PACKED when you finally get in the door. But, don't worry. They will find a table for you by the time your order is ready. Just go ahead and place your order, stand where they tell you to and the owner will tell you when and where to sit. Just do it. It's a privilege to be in there.Now, the food. I'll start with a disclaimer, as a native South Floridian, I didn't really know good BBQ from bad. I mean, we're known for not knowing how to vote, and not for our BBQ. But I married a Texan. (Yeah, girls, be jealous, they know how to grow them in Texas.) And, my Texan knows BBQ. So, an endorsement from him is a big deal. He LOVES this place.They make this beef brisket by smoking long and low. It gets this lovely smoke ring all around, and the flavor is to die for. Then they get their sausages from Mikeska's. Texans will know what that means because Mikeska's is a Texas institution. They know their sausage. And, Smoque gets it from them. (The sausage is a big sellout early in the evening, so try before 7 pm for that).And, the cornbread! Oh, man! Sweet but not like cake. Moist. With little pieces of real corn. Love it.Then, they make their baked beans in house. With their own recipe. And they put chopped beef brisket in the baked beans! Oh, my stomach growls and my mouth waters just writing about it. Chi-town, how I will miss those beans!The hubby likes the mac and cheese. He's a big mac and cheese eater and he likes the one made here.Lastly, one of the owners is usually in the kitchen, while the other one helps keep the line flowing smoothly and the seating arranged.

And it was a little bit of a tough sell because from our hotel in downtown it looked like it was half way to O'Hare. But after the first few bites the consensus was that it was worth the $20 cab ride. I went with the baby back ribs and they were the best I have ever had. I liked that they were served with the sauce on the side so you could appreciate the rub that not only flavored the meat but caramelized slightly to give the ribs a great texture. The girlfriend, J, is a brisket fan and she declared the brisket at Smoque the best she's ever had. So why 4-stars and not 5? Well for me the barbecue experience has to have great sides. The sides at Smoque are great. We had a combination of mac & cheese, beans, coleslaw and cornbread. But --and this is really nitpicky-- I didn't think the sides were as good as the sides at Baby Blues BBQ in Venice, CA, another Triple D hot spot.

The brisket was equally tender. It could have benefited from a bit more fat, and the accompanying sauce had a little too much acidity for my taste, but they were still good eats.The sides really stole the show. The mac & cheese is probably the best I've had in Chicago (thus far); the beans have a rich smokiness and some pork mixed in; the slaw, although not creamy, was crispy and fresh; and the cobbler was deeeelicious with a thick, crispy crust and firm, fresh peaches.

So I look up at the huge chalkboard menu trying to find it....not on the menu?! Impossible! After a couple of minutes of careful study of the board, I had to settle for the half baby back, half St. Louis rib dinner. Then I found out that they can, and do run out of food for the day. I was told they were out of baby back ribs. So I settle for the St. Louis ribs. And I was not impressed. The rub on the ribs was only OK. The meat itself was just OK. I smelled the sauce that comes on the side. Smelled great, so I poured it on my ribs. And it proceeded to run all down my fingers onto my hands. The darn sauce is too thin! Not cool. Hopefully it'll wake up the flavor of the meat. I took a bite of the sauce-soaked meat, and it was a tad bit better. But I'd have to say that it's best to stay away from the ribs, at least the St. Louis ones.I faired a lot better the second time around. I'm not a fan of pulled pork, so I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich. Best beef brisket sandwich I've had so far. The meat was delicious and cooked to perfection.I have to give them props for the mac and cheese. It is awesome! Too bad they give you so little of it. I'll have to order an extra next time.

Driving will be worth it.We all enjoyed our meals. For myself, I ordered the St. Louis 1/2 slab, brisket, the Texas sausage, mac 'n cheese, BBQ beans. The brisket was by far my favorite. The slab was great, plenty of meat. It's important to note that my BBQ preference leans more toward the fall-off-the-bone saucey type vs. the dry rub though, and that's what the St. Louis slab was, the dry rub kind. But, I enjoyed it regardless.The sauce pretty much made this food trip for me, I loved it. I'm one who tends to think a lot of things need more acid though, so I enjoyed the sauce being more on the vinegary side, but that might not be your thing. There is another sauce available that's much thicker, less acid, with sweeter notes. As for the sausage, it was okay. I would just move on over to Uncle John's instead if you plan on centering your order around something that.I'm not head over heels in love with the mac 'n cheese like everyone else on here seems to be because I've had much better, but it IS very creamy, and very good.Not a fan of the communalesque seating but at least they've got a system going in helping you get seated.", "Date": "2011-05-07", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Bridget K.", "ReviewID": "4AhIappZwZGMhmtj2JPdRw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's not hard to believe that Smoque BBQ is one of the highest reviewed places in Chicago on Yelp. \u00a0My family and I went here for dinner the Saturday after Thanksgiving. \u00a0We had to wait outside because the line was kind of long and pretty busy. \u00a0Luckily Smoque supplies umbrellas for those waiting outside because it was raining. \u00a0A few minutes later we were inside and waiting to order. \u00a0The decor is nice, with the articles about Smoque from the New York Times as well as the Food Network from when Diners, Drive-ins and Dives came to film. \u00a0We got up to the counter and ordered. \u00a0I got the Pulled Pork Sandwich with a side of Mac 'N Cheese. \u00a0We moved out of the way and waited for the staff to find us a table for 7 people. \u00a0The Pulled Pork was the best Texas style that I have had! \u00a0It was the perfect ratio of Pulled Pork to sauce. \u00a0The Mac 'N Cheese was also great. \u00a0You can't go wrong with any of the food at Smoque BBQ. \u00a0My family headed outside to wait for my brother to bring the car around because of the rain. \u00a0The owner happened to walk outside to tell us we could wait inside, if we wanted to. \u00a0We ended up standing around the front talking about the restaurant and how the business runs. \u00a0He also explained how Smoque ended up with an article in the New York Times and the reason behind the umbrellas. \u00a0Smoque was a great experience. \u00a0I look forward to going back soon.", "Date": "2011-12-13", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Steve G.", "ReviewID": "Q33KAu3oL40F14isFCHFvA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Going to Smoque for BBQ is like going to the south side for blues. As a white, middle class suburban kid, this is an adventure! Fortunately, they're about 6 inches off of the Kennedy on Pulaski, so that's lowers the anxiety a bit. But then you pull in and the street seems full of signs that basically say, \"If you're a Smoque customer, don't even THINK of parking here!\" In fact, I think some of the signs said EXACTLY that. But after a bit of roaming around, we found a parking spot that didn't appear to have a \"TOW ZONE\" sign in effect -- at that moment.With that friendly neighborhood greeting, we walked into Smoque. It's nothing special to look at on the outside, and not much better inside. There's a wall-covering blackboard with the menu, but it's starting to fade out, making it hard for noobs like us to decipher. Fortunately, my brother is a regular here, so I didn't need the menu.Even at 1:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon, the place is jammed. The line is not out the door, and that's something. We order, a kid on the floor asks uhow many are in our party, and what our order numbers are. Every table is jammed and it looks like we're going to eat standing up.15 minutes or less later, as the kitchen nears our number, the kid shows us to 4 seats, conveniently located in the corner and near the pop machine --perfect for me! 3 minutes later, our food comes out. I order the sweet jalapenos and head back to the table.My first mouthful of chopped brisket is, well, awesome! Lots of smoke, crunchy crust, great beef taste, subtle complex BBQ sauce and perfect moisture. Cole slaw and fries are both really good, as are the beans.I agree with my bro -- the brisket is the choice here, but my wife's pulled pork sandwich was great -- and the 1/2 sandwich was just the right size for her appetite.We didn't feel rushed, even with 30+ people standing in the aisles waiting for a table.

But I was skeptical. Could it be as good as Fat Willey's (hands down my favorite BBQ in Chicago)? We decided to stop by on a whim and get carryout. The place was hoppin'. You order at the counter to get your food, and while there was a line at 5pm on a Sunday, the orders were coming up quick. I got my food in about 5 minutes after ordering even though it was packed.To give it due diligence, I ordered the full slab of ribs (1/2 baby back, 1/2 St. Louis style) with sides of mac and cheese and cornbread.We consumed and digested, and now the verdict is in. I have to say Smoque is every bit as good as Fat Willey's and that it might be a tie as to which I like better. Actually, I would have to have the ribs side by side to make a final decision.But the thing I like about Smoque are the options you have. Picking your sides is great, because the mac and cheese was really good, though I probably wouldn't want a large order of it. And the cornbread was tasty. Only the slaw was average.The ribs were great, both styles. The sauce was good, but did not overpower the meat. And the fact that you can get a half and half order is cool. Also-BIG PLUS-for $3 extra, you can get a side of beef brisket or pulled pork. I am always in the dilemma of whether I want brisket or just ribs, and this option solved my problem, and for the $3 you definitely get enough to make it worth it. The brisket was excellent as well.The place itself was actually not what I pictured at all. For some reason, I thought it was going to be somewhat more upscale (which for BBQ and the location, \u00a0I'm not sure why I thought this).But in fact the inside is as casual and bare bones as it gets. It's all about the food. There are dozens of small tables pushed together to make for a communal, get to know your neighbor, kind of experience.Everyone seemed friendly as well.There were people and kids of all kinds eating here and ordering to go.As far as ambiance, I may prefer Fat Willey's because it is a little more sit down, though casual, and they have outdoor seating and beer. But Smoque has it's own thing going too, and you may prefer to just order your food at the counter, rather than have someone waiting on you.Now the next time I need BBQ, it will be a tough decision.

This place smells GREAT from the street. Even better than San Soo Gab San if that means anything to you.Story time. . .we joined the line out the door at 6:27pm on Memorial Day weekend and stood in light rain for about 10 minutes waiting to get in.While we waited outside the owner appeared and taped an apology on the door for running out of brisket. Ten minutes later he replaced that sign with an out of pulled pork/out of brisket sign. None of this looked good, and some other peeps in line began to scuttle away to their safe little plan B Thai places. Fail.Knowing what was at stake we decided to stick it out. We made it inside and felt the panic and longing as we tried to avoid leering at the other diners gnawing their ribs and stuffing those fat delicious fries down their gullets.The wife noticed plenty of pork sandwiches were still making it out of the prep area. Hmm. . .where did this magical bonus pork appear from? The smoker only holds so much meat, and it bestows its gifts but once a day, and lo it runneth out from time to time, but we decided they post the \"gone fishin\" signs when the line threatens to test the patience of the neighbors. Or maybe someone in the kitchen is about to stab someone.Anyway long story short we were all sitting down to delicious pulled pork sandwiches by 6:56. So let's do the math. . .even at their most slammed, this teeny L train sized shack can deliver you from literally out at the curb to pulled pork heaven inside of 30 minutes. Just keep your cool like the staff does and you'll be fine.ok let's talk portion control. I can overeat with the best of you slobs. . .Smoque's sandwiches are plenty big, even if you're one of those carb haters that scrapes the meat off. It comes with a \"small\" fry that has about 2 potatoes' worth in a grease lovin mini grocery bag and a fistful of slaw. I am not into slaw; I ate this slaw. It's crispy and fresh and has no mayo. Nice celery seed flavor to it though. The owner told me they add fresh dressing to the cabbage every 20 minutes. So kimche it's not. Thank god.Wow you're still here. . .ok for your first visit I'd suggest the half and half, just to validate your suspicion that the pulled pork is ever so slightly better than the brisket. Why do you think they make bacon out of pork? I rest my case. Still you need to try everything here, let's try that brisket. It's mighty good.2nd trip reconnect with the pork. mmmm pork.My next visit I'll get St. Louis style ribs. I'm told they are fattier, meatier and have mo' flav than the baby back ribs. Ribs are pricey and I'm cheap so I'll prob. get the half slab.Staff, presentation, ambience. . .in that order. The prep guys all look pretty tough, kinda like that. Actually I am totally grateful they didn't put up retarded \"authentic\" roadhouse memorabilia or weathered barnwood. I admit if it were grimy and old and on the south side and you got lost trying to find it it would seem like more of an adventure. Just saying.Check out the smoker when you go back to wash your hands. It's like 8 times bigger than those rotisseries they have at Dominick's.Prices are fair. We got out of there for around $10 a head. Not bad at all.Minor point, they do a lot of little things to keep it all running smoothly. Too boring to write about but I noticed them all.

There's one area for drinks that is in the far corner and you're bumping into people just to move. Plus the cups they give you are so small for water, you might as well plan on getting up multiple times just to get enough water.

He was watching youtube videos of the Food Network (which I'm sure was in violation of strict copyright and redistributing laws) and showed me these raving reviews of this joint called Smoque. All the people were saying \"this brisket is better than Mississippi\" and whatnot. So, I thought myself if I get brisket at Smoque, then I can eliminate going to Mississippi. Really, there's no reason to go to Mississippi besides barbeque.So, I says \"hell yeah,bro, let's get that brisket\". I wasn't even that hungry, but I'm a fat glutton and love delicious food. We roll six deep over to Smoque.We go inside and there are bunch of scattered tables with no seating that could accommodate us six. Basically, two of us have to sit by the bathrooms, two of us by the windows and the last two sit by themselves one either side of an elderly Korean couple by the soda machine. They have a guy walking around trying to smoosh people together.Eating is my favorite social event and I can't talk about stupid things that happened at work or about girls I hooted at while driving, then what's the point of eating together? The other people in a restaurant don't want hear about women I yelled at today. No one is interested in that, especially not that elderly Korean couple.To say the least, I thought not being able to comfortably accommodate 30 people at one time is something most popular restaurants should be able to do. I don't think I'm being picky.It took me twenty or so minutes to get to the order taker girl. My five friends all went before me and all ordered this famous brisket I've been hearing so much about (from the youtube). I get up there and ask for the brisket platter. This girl told me they just ran out of brisket. I am completely bewildered as to how five people, and countless before us, ordered brisket with no problem. \"Fine, you know what, let me get the pulled pork. I can't believe you ran out of brisket so abruptly, but that's fine. I'll just take the pork, it's fine. Whatever.\"No dice. The girl told me they just ran out of pork as well. Smoque has four different things: chicken, ribs, brisket and pork, and they just ran out of two of those four things.This girl said that she could take my money and if somehow they find brisket, they could give it to me. I said I didn't want anything else based on principle. Restaurants shouldn't run out of half of their types of food. It's like going to McDonald's and they didn't have any more hamburgers or any sort. I don't want chicken McNuggets (metaphorically), I want some damn brisket (literally).I know what you're thinking, they turned me down because I'm ugly. Not true as I am quite handsome. Apparently, handsome doesn't get you brisket in this town anymore.So, I sat there, pretty hungry and with no food on my non-plate. My friends all pitied me, offering me some of their food. I had a taste of their brisket (it was aight) and some of their fries (mostly aight).There was mac and cheese that was disgusting and coleslaw that looked like it was made by a chef with no hands.The owner or some self-important guy with a belt clip cell phone and zubaz pants walking around the twenty square feet of dining area asking how everything was going. I think he knew better than to ask me because I would let him have it.I saved the thirteen some odd dollars I would have spent on something I never wanted to eat that wouldn't have been good anyway and spent a third of that on some awesome Wendy's.If I could give Smoque one fourth of a star, I so would.Love,MarvinP.S.

In the past couple of years, Chicago has been seeing an influx of true BBQ restaurants; we're no longer tied to just a par boiled rib slathered in BBQ and then slapped onto a grill. Smoque is the real deal.Amongst the BBQ restuarants in Chicago that I've tried (The Patio, County BBQ, and out in Wheaton, Steamboat BBQ) Smoque is arguably the best. When you go to Smoque's you will immediately see an incredibly full dining room and probably a ridiculous line. This is always a good sign to me. There is very little service involved here, walk up menu and then a host will seat you (\"host\" being a loose term as they are the waterboys, they clean and they help people line up if its getting crazy). When your order is ready you get up and get it, so again, service doesn't mean much here. That being said I've found everyone there very helpful and kind, though busy.The food is the main attraction of course and when I went to Smoque I had the BBQ Rib Combo. I wanted to try both the baby backs and the St. louis ribs. The St. Louis style ribs are much better, some how more tender and definitely more flavorful. Full of smoke and pork flavor and deliciously meaty (they're not too thin but thinner than the baby backs for sure). I was very happy with the baby backs as well due to the real smoke flavor however if you are deciding between the two, save yourself the trouble and get a full slab of St. Louis ribs. I will note however, that both ribs were a bit dry on the edges. I attribute this to the inconsistencies of BBQ smoking. This is not an easy thing to avoid when you are cranking out many racks of ribs a day so I let it slide (especially since this may be the most faithful BBQ representation in the area). However as time goes on I expect this to get better. The BBQ sauce they serve with the ribs is also very good; smokey and sweet. I did not find any hot BBQ sauce but you might have to ask for it; I hear they have some off menu add-ons that you just have to know about. For the sides I had coleslaw, beans and fries. All of which were very good. The beans were smokey with quite a bit of bacon bits and the coleslaw was actually excellent. It was my favorite side. The slaw was not the creamy kind you normally get from BBQ restaurants, it was tangy and refreshing. The fries were also good but honestly I don't really care too much about the difference between fries as long as they're crispy and tasty.Overall, Smoque's is great representation of what is possible for BBQ in Chicago. We're long overdue for real BBQ flavor and I'm hoping that Smoque's only gets better over time. Here's to more BBQ in the area!Also, if you're from UIUC and are trying to compare to Black Dog's, in terms of ribs I still prefer Black Dog's but they give you less meat and they're more expensive compared to Smoque's.

I went to Nashville for work and flew to Nashville Airport. On the way back home, I almost got a ticket cuz I was almost late, but somehow, once I got checked in 'n' all, I had plenty of time! So, since I didn't eat lunch, I stopped by this random bar that served food (remember, this is in an AIRPORT). I had their pulled pork, and while their BBQ sauce was about on par with Smoque, the pulled pork itself was DELICIOUS! But this is not a review about Airport Bar Food, this is Smoque.Then I thought to myself, there is no way that an AIRPORT, no matter where it is, can have better BBQ than an established and popular restaurant like Smoque. I've been dying to go back to compare, and finally I did...Tried: (My rating in parentheses)- St. Louis Ribs (8/10)- Pulled Pork (2/10)(Sides)- Mac & Cheese (7/10)- Smoque Chili (3/10)- Slaw (1/10)(Sauce)- Memphis Style (5/10)This time I got a 1/2 slab of St. Louis and the pulled pork. They had a special thing for Smoque Chili, so I subbed that for the beans. Now that I actually have something to compare the pulled pork to, I can safely say that Smoque's pulled pork is bad. It's try and tasteless. It's so bad that the mediocre BBQ sauce actually helps it a lot, but the texture doesn't change and it's just disappointing. Feels like sawdust, your mouth gets dryer eating it. With every bite I compared it to Nashville Airport's and it paled in every regard. Funny, because this is what people say to try when you go.St. Louis Ribs took a small 1 pt dive. Maybe it's because it's not new anymore, I don't know. 8 is still very respectable; problem is, I don't think I'll ever crave Smoque for it. The rib meat itself is great, but I don't want to have JUST ribs, I want sauce, and if the rib meat is good, but sauce sucks, then it just crapsizes the whole experience.All in all, I'm lowering my Smoque rating to 2/5. It really is \"Meh\" and I really have experienced better. It's not A-OK, and I'm pretty certain that I'll never have a craving for it. In fact, if I'm with a group of people and they all suggest Smoque, I won't adamantly refuse, but I will definitely be the first to offer a new suggestion.

Their St. Louis ribs and pulled pork are what stands out here. Sometimes there ribs are tough and shitty, but that's only happened once. The brisket, chicken, baby back ribs, and sides are all delicious as well. They just don't shine like the pulled pork does. If you get a take out order I would suggest asking for extra barbecue sauce, just because it's always good to have extra.Out of all the barbecue places that I've ate at in Chicago I would say that Smoque has the most consistent quality of smoked meats.

Bad idea. To preface: We are not food snobs at all. All we want is good food, good service, and a pleasant experience. We go out to eat several times a week and try to judge everything fairly, within context, and with an open-mind. I say this only because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this place that I do not get at ALL.They have their own parking lot, and we had no trouble with street parking. Walking up to the restaurant, the outdoor seating section looked lovely (unfortunately, it was full - at 5:30 PM on a Friday, so go early). We walked inside and were told by the busboys they'd \"seat us\" after we placed an order, but the inside was completely empty and basically had cafeteria-style seating, so, um...okay. Dress code? Feel free to show up in your sweatpants (not necessarily a complaint, ha).You place your order at the counter, much like a deli, and are given a number. We ordered from a bored young girl who couldn't have looked more unhappy to be there. Within mere minutes, your number is yelled out for you to walk back up to pick up your tray. Okay, so in a deli, your food can be made-to-order within minutes, but BBQ? No. So the food is not made-to-order. You can BYOB or serve yourself at a soda station, not unlike, again, a deli or McDonald's or Burger King.My BF ordered ribs with the brisket chili and mac & cheese, I ordered the chicken with corn bread and mac & cheese. They really are sides, quite small, which is fine. The sauce is VERY VERY VERY sweet, like, 20 sugars dumped in per serving sweet. The chicken was fine, the ribs were fine. Far, far, far from the best we've had, but certainly not the worst...just meh. The main dishes were just...fine. Nothing to write home about, at all. Maybe they'd have tasted better if they hadn't been (barely) luke-warm. The sides were excellent, and I wish they were available as their own entrees. My boyfriend completely devoured their coleslaw (I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general), so that's also a plus in terms of sides (and comes included).So, yeah. Cafeteria seating.

Food that isn't made-to-order. The entrees are overpriced, the sides are excellent. Disgustingly-sweet sauce. $40 for this? The equivalent of fast food? No, thank you, not with all of the legitimately incredible options out there. Guess it'd be alright for a quick lunch if you don't mind blowing $40-50 on lunch for 2. Their prices are ridiculously inflated for the quality of the food and the dining experience.Maybe this is \"great BBQ\" for people who never venture out their own neighborhood. It's not even charmingly simple or down-to-earth. We left super-disappointed.

When I'm on the North side it will definitely be Smoque again.Let's start with the meats. I had the Rib Combo (both Baby Back and St. Louis). They were cooked to perfection. As a BBQ Judge I have become very spoiled with perfect ribs, and these are perfect ribs. The meat comes cleanly off the bone where you bite, but it does not \"fall off the bone\" when you take a bite. The bone dries immediately. That's a perfectly cooked rib. As for flavor, it was fabulous. I asked for the sauce on the side so that I could taste the meat, and it was heavenly. I added some sauce and it just made me happy. Both the Baby Back and the St. Louis ribs are awesome. My wife had the sliced Brisket. It, too was awesome. Just a little on the dry side, but nothing to complain about. She, too, had the sauce on the side, and if they would have put the sauce on the meat, it would have been perfect. The sides are great. We had Mac n' Cheese, Brisket Chili and Cornbread. The Slaw comes with the meal, too. They were all awesome. Mac n' Cheese was very cheesy, creamy, and not overcooked like many establishments. The Brisket Chili is almost as good as mine (seriously that is awesome Chili). Heavy on the Brisket, light on the beans. The Cornbread was sweet and moist, and delicious. And now the Slaw. Normally I like creamy Slaw, but this Slaw was fabulous. Sweet vinegar with red onions and cabbage. Simple, and simply divine. One thing I really like about both of my favorite 'Que places in town is the fact that the owners take an interest in the customers. Barry was out working the crowd, he apologized when our meal was taking a little longer than he liked. He followed up with everyone in the place, and when I asked for a little Pulled Pork to go, he got me some. All in all it was a very great visit.Now to that Pulled Pork. We live about 45 minutes away, so I knew the pork would be cold, but oh, how heavenly. The perfect amount of smoke, still very juicy, and tender. Again, not overcooked.

The pulled pork and beef brisket are amazing and perfect and all that, but they use that Hawaiian style of bread, which I don't think works with BBQ; the sweetness of the bread combined with the sweetness of the sauce just makes the whole thing too sugary.

I'm not trying to be silly. Really. This is my favorite thing about this place.I am from Kansas City. Roll your eyes if you want; I'll wait. I'm from Kansas City and nothing can unseat from my heart those champions of BBQ (Smokestack, Gates, Oklahoma Joe's). But I'm also a realistic person. I know it's more convenient to drive 20 minutes south instead of 9.5 hours south when I feel like eating BBQ. And my fianc\u00e9 loves this place so I'm sort of stuck with it.Now, if this was KC, I'd rate this place on meat, beans and sauce. But this is not KC. And by that, of course, I mean the beans aren't great. So instead I'll rate this place on the tins, the meat, and (dammit) the sauce.The brisket is pretty good. By Chicago standards, I think it's pretty famously good. The sliced brisket has a strip of fat through it which weirds me out, but I'm easily weirded out by fat. I will carve a brand new cut of meat out of a steak if it's served with any normal amount of fat on the edges... and I certainly carve the fat out of this brisket. But this probably only reflects poorly on me, and not on Smoque or most other restaurants, for that matter.The sauce is really where I wish this place exceeded itself. The thin and vinegary sauce is ok, but it's not great or grand. I had high hopes for the thicker sauce but it tastes like BBQ ketchup. And so I suffer, destroyed by my unfulfilled BBQ-cravings. It's good on french fries, though. I'll give 'em that. But it's in Chicago, you know. It's in Chicago and it's alright. Plus the service is friendly and I'm into that.

I was not prepared for what happened next.Wow. Just wow. My pulled pork (enough to serve 2) was mouthwatering. It was perfectly cooked and also came with a side of extra BBQ sauce (included with the order). The baked mac and cheese was crunchy on top and melted inside. The cornbread was the best though, quite possibly the best comfort food, better than your mom could make it, trust me. I got the peach cobbler as one of my sides (yes, amazingly I had room for dessert)....the perfect ending to the perfect meal. No complaints whatsoever.OH! My boyfriend's sides included cole slaw - I absolutely despise cole slaw but here they make it almost sour - just cabbage, onion and vinegar, it was great in between bites, really crisp and cleansed the pallet.When we finished eating, someone offered to take our plates and the next couple was seated.

We stopped in on a Friday afternoon and walked right up to the counter, ordered from a very friendly young man and grabbed a table after filling our cups with some sweet tea (which is a must with southern barbeque). Shortly thereafter our number was called and we dug in. We sampled a bit of everything with the exception of the peach cobbler, ribs and chicken. I chose the brisket, brisket chili (lay off me, I spent my formative years in Texas and I love brisket) and fries as my sides. My dining companions went with the pulled pork, cornbread and macaroni and cheese and the brisket and Texas sausage, baked beans and cornbread. The brisket was delicious. It was juicy and surrounded by the most flavorful bark. It was so good, I let it go sauce-less. The Texas sausage is another matter. On its own, it's good. It's spicy. But, it needs the sauce. It's almost as if it was made to pair with Smoque's sauce because when you put the two together, it's barbeque bliss. The pulled pork was melt-in-your-mouth good. But, I'm glad I chose the brisket. And the sides were amazing! The brisket chili is Texas chili at its finest. It was so well-seasoned and chock full of brisket, beans and tomatoes. I wanted to take a quart of it home so that I could slip into something more comfortable and get in some alone time with it. The cornbread was sweet and savory, with kernels of corn throughout, and perfect for sopping up every last bit of the sauce from my plate. The baked beans were super tasty but paled in comparison to the chili. Now, I do not go out of my way for macaroni and cheese but Smoque has me singing a different tune. It was rich and topped with bread crumbs. It was so good your granny would be tempted to ask for the recipe. Let us not forget the coleslaw that comes with all the platters. It's just cabbage and vinegar (apple cider vinegar maybe?) and perhaps some seasoning but it is fantastic. It's clean and simple and it pairs perfectly with richness of the meats. I loved it, loved it, loved it. And the sauce is divine. It's the love child of Memphis barbeque sauce and Texas barbeque sauce. It's vinegary and spicy and the stuff Smoque makes will stay there forever if you dare to get it under your nails...So get that frown off your face, Smoque's gonna replace it with a smile and a dream come true.

We drove up to the place and we could tell by the fine smells in the parking lot that it was going to be good. The line was out the door but moved surprisingly fast. We didn't realize until we got halfway through the line that it was BYOB, but luckily some nice dudes in front of us had an extra cold, six-pack of fat tires in their car they gave us.... i was sad to say they were out of most everything-- pork, st. louis ribs, and others-- they were kind enough to let us know before we got in line, but we stayed anyways. I got the chopped brisket platter and my buddy got the full slab of baby back ribs. the food comes to you on unpretentious trays and everything is nice and tidily packaged up for you. that is, until you eat. for me, my typical method of attack is to save the main entree for last and hover around the sides for a bit to warm things up. I got baked beans, mac n cheese and cole slaw... and it was good! baked beans probably some of the best I've had... they were sweet and tangy with huge chunks of meat and a great texture. I could have had a tub of those and been satisfied. \u00a0the mac was pretty decent and the cole slaw was exactly the way it should be: fresh ingredients with a nice vinegary kick. on to the meat: my brisket was good. I wouldn't say amazing. It had a really good smoked flavor, even without the sauce. The meat was cooked well... but the sauce really added to the flavor. I believe they had a north carolina sauce for the brisket which had a great balance of sweetness but wasn't too tart, and didn't overwhelm the flavor of the brisket. I'd say for me it was more than above average for sure, but no grand slam however.but my buddy's baby back ribs and sauce: muy rico!!!! the lady said they used a Memphis-style sauce that had just a hint of spices that really hit spot and the meat was fantastic. I like the fact that the ribs had simultaneously a slight crispy outside and fall-off-the-bone quality \u00a0inside. it was wonderful, even without the sauce.we feasted quite heartily and after knocking down a few beers left Smoque completely satisfied and hopefully I'll be back for a second visit sometime soon.a word on the service: it was really busy and since you order, get a number and wait for it to get called to go up to the counter to get your food, it had the potential to get really crazy and disorganized. But the few fellas that were helping guide traffic not only did a good job, but they were really friendly and genuinely wanted to make ur dining experience better. one of the guys got a bottle opener for our beers and opened the bottles himself... even though we would have done it ourselves.anyways, I'm not prepared to say just yet that smoque lives up to the hype, but so far so good.

I haven't smelled ribs, I haven't had ribs in forever, I just wake up with this gut feeling that tells me-hey, you need some damn ribs in your life. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, I need some BBQ in my belly. Maybe it's because I lived in Texas those two years of my life, I don't know.I had been meaning to try Smoque but was terrified of the long lines that I heard about. If there's one thing that I don't like, it's waiting for food when I'm hungry. I get grouchy, I get mean, I get-well, we just don't need to see me when I'm too hungry. So once upon a saturday, me and the bf woke up early to go and get BBQ. We got there around 11:45; no wait in line at all for us! I was excited! But I didn't know what to get. And there wasn't a combo platter, OH NOES. I wanted to try everything.So. I kind of did. I got a half slab of the St. Louis ribs and a side of brisket. My lovely boyfriend was so kind to get the pulled pork sandwich, so I got to try some of his as well. Everything was delicious. I don't know what brisket these other people are eating, but mine was quite tender and not dry at all. The ribs had the nice pull to them that you expect from St. Louis ribs, and I really appreciate the fact that you get different sauces for different meats. A-plus.So that was Saturday. Then Tuesday rolls around, and my boyfriend offers to pick up Smoque again for dinner. BBQ and Lost? Who can say no. This time, I got the pulled pork sandwich and a side of the sausage.We also split another half slab of St. Louis ribs. I loved the bread that it came on, I felt that it didn't soak up all of the bbq sauce and let it marinate on down into the meat. The sausage was wonderfully smokey with a hint of spice in the background. I wish it was a little spicier, but I think that's because I love hot links. I'm really only giving it four stars because I think their sides could be a little better. I enjoy the mac and cheese, but it doesn't blow me out of the water and there aren't enough vegetable options. Like, hello? I could be eating some greens with my ribs.

When these elements are in balance, you have found BBQ heaven.We've worked hard to match the right cut of meat with the right rub, wood smoke, sauce, and cooking technique. Our proprietary sauces and rubs are lovingly crafted from scratch in our own kitchen. Same goes for our sides.It's a bit more work to do it this way, but we believe the results are well worth it.

The smalls were a bit too small, it's meant for one person but we ordered a lot of sides to share.

It's true that you will generally have to wait for your food (abt 15 min. for us at 2:20PM on a weekday) and you will probably have to wait for a table (but your food will be timed to your seating). However, Smoque doesn't seem to have either dropped the ball in either its organization or its setup. Smoque is simply too popular and it's dealing with that in the most sensible way possible. So instead of hovering over people as you might do in HK, Smoque has a dude who asks you if you're eating in or out and places you on a list for seating accordingly. If you think about the space, Smoque isn't actually tiny or cramped. It has tables and seats for at least 40 people. It just seems that way because those seats are always filled. In any case, if you're whining about the wait ... you're contributing to its popularity so it seems a bit circular. IDKAnyway, I enjoyed everything I ate. My only gripe in terms of the food is portion size (again) I know, but this time of the sides. I know the focus is on the meat, in my case - baby back and st. louis ribs, but I do wish that some of the sides (Mac 'N Cheese, Baked Beans) were a little (a lot) larger. I don't know that if you order them separately instead of as part of a platter if they'll be any larger, but the side orders that come with a platter are definitely not sized to share. The only exception to this is the bag of their steak cut fries, which are delicious. As for the food itself. St. Louis Ribs were very tender and moist, the baby back ribs less so - but apparently this has to do with sauce distribution.The mac 'n cheese was the tastiest version I've had for a while without any graininess and it definitely tasted of real cheese and not that cheez whiz stuff. Baked beans were just delicious. Cornbread was a little on the dry side if you were to eat it by itself but paired well with the ribs. I also love how the coleslaw is not mayo-based (vinegar instead). It provides a really welcome interlude of crunchy sour fiber. The meal for 3 people came out to about $50 for two platters of ribs that we couldn't finish. Each platter came with about 12 ribs. Platters come with slaw and your choice of 2 sides.Smoque is also michelin-starred (I assume 1 star but feel too lazy to fact-check), if you're interested in that kind of stuff.", "Date": "2010-12-30", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Kevan C.", "ReviewID": "s3rmJI6VLTYhP4Q6RbmNfA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As soon as we stepped in out of the rain, we were in line.

Having grown up in the Chicago area, I have a fondness and affinity for that sticky-sweet-tomatoey-Carson's-type of sauce (not that I would complain about L. Woods either). However, having lived in the deep south for many years, I also appreciate that pit-wet-and-dry-smokey-vinegary thing as well. So I was very excited when a new BBQ place had opened in the neighborhood.Smoque is a little place on a well-traveled corner. It is very clean and brightly lit (almost too brightly lit) and there are about 20 simple wooden tables with chairs, all of which were filled when we arrived. There is an open kitchen with a counter with friendly people, where you place and pick up your order. The nice-sized brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and platters have a terrific depth of flavor, with that smoky tang that takes you to the Carolinas, or Memphis, or someplace down there. Individual ramekins of cornbread and mac and cheese are noteworthy complements, and the BBQ beans should not be missed.

The pulled pork is also very good. Cole slaw is citrus based which I prefer and comes with the platters. As for sides my favorites are Mac and cheese and fries. The brisket chili is also very good. Less impressive I thought were the peach cobbler and cornbread but nothing is bad.Lastly, the service is great. The owners are really friendly and are great at customer service.

When we first walked in there was a sign warning that they would run out of pulled pork soon. Seeing as this is what I came to eat, it was pretty annoying that they would run out of one of their most popular items. When we did get to the register, it took them awhile, but they decided they had enough pulled pork left for one sandwich. I was happy that I was going to be able to eat!After ordering my boyfriend and I were seated very quickly, but I was squished between a pair of Chicago police officers and an overweight couple. So this was annoying and awkward. Holding a conversation was difficult being in such close proximity to the other people, and being bumped by the man next to me multiple times made it even worse. Now I know why they can seat people so quickly- no one wants to stay and eat when it means you are forced into dining 3 inches away from complete strangers. Once my food came, I was just looking forward to eating. But, my sandwich was cold. Cold pulled pork is disgusting!!! Obviously, this was very disappointing. Since the place is so crowded as rushed, and they had ran out of pulled pork, asking them to fix it seemed unlikely. Overall, if Smoque would have served me a good meal I could have gotten over the other annoyances, but when you can't even serve me my (overpriced) sandwich at an acceptable temperature, you fail.PS- Don't order small ala carte sides.

I was fortunate enough to get here before the busy crowd (about 5:45-6:00 on a Friday). Instantly after I placed my order, there was a line reaching the door. The facts. St.Louis Ribs. Bomb diggidy. Big ol' smoke ring (the pink lining under the skin for newbies). They remove the translucent skin underneath the rib, hate when places don't do that. Hugs the bone gently, doesn't fall off the bone (that's a no-no, again for you newbs). Sliced brisket, that's one BIG OHHH YEAHHH! Masterfully cooked with and almost pillowy texture. No sauce needed. Pulled pork's good, but I'd prefer a vinegar based sauce for PP (can't all get what we want though). We forgot to order the Texas sausage, nooooooooo....The sides. Coleslaw is one of the best.

So I gave it a try. First trip a no go. \u00a0Was gonna do the walk in thing. line was almost out the front door. \u00a0Also it was an odd way to have the line waiting. It's in the middle of the restaurant so you have a lot of ppl moving back and forth between the line including servers bringing food to customers who were eating in. I have issues this I know! however, something rubs me the wrong way when I see food traveling to tables having to weave its way through a line of mouth-breathers, looky lous and coughers before it gets to the table. I'm sure it happens in other places but maybe because I don't see it it doesn't bother me as much. \u00a0Anyway after catching that glispse I decided another day would be my opportunity to try them and it would definitely be via call in. So the next time comes around about a week later (Monday of this week 8-19). The order is the 1/2 slab baby back ribs, and the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. the ribs were so so, a little dry and the flavor combination didn't work for me before adding the sauce. the brisket a little better. the taste was good without the sauce and slightly better with. the pulled pork by far was the best of the three. And no I'm not a fat, greedy pig. \u00a0got the items for two people and we split the meals as it was her first time trying them too. I'll keep looking for good BBQ in the city of Chicago. To me there was nothing really special about the flavors and taste of the BBQ, not to mention the layout and annoyance that I felt on my first visit wasn't particiularly great either. Still had to wait in the line to pay for my call in order and that was extended because they were training a new girl on the register. \u00a0Yeah, I'm grumpy and not an old man!I'm gonna wrap this up.

\u00a0Their menu is the basics of barbeque. \u00a0So far I've had the brisket and the St. Louis ribs. \u00a0Both are spectacular. \u00a0I have never had ribs with better texture, they're just cooked perfectly. \u00a0The meat is excellently flavored, but it's almost a side act to the sauce. \u00a0This rib sauce is the best I've ever tasted, it is absolutely amazing. \u00a0The brisket sauce is less striking, but it's busy taking a backseat to the meat. \u00a0The brisket is almost falling apart, and can actually take a little work to eat with a fork, but is somehow not overcooked. \u00a0It's got a wonderfully slow flavor, and my girlfriend will testify that I sat there just staring off into space as each bite worked its way on through to a perfect smoky aftertaste. \u00a0Now, there's the matter of the sides. \u00a0They're all incredible. \u00a0I'd like it if the place had potato salad, but I would be forced to take another couple minutes to decide on my sides each time if it did. \u00a0The owner, who is constantly circulating, making sure everyone's doing well, stops to talk to customers constantly, and when he stopped by our table mentioned that they're working on a potato salad. \u00a0With as much work as they've clearly put into the other sides, I'm very much looking forward to it, since I'll be going back regularly. \u00a0The coleslaw is pitch perfect, tangy rather than sweet, and very simple. \u00a0It cuts the flavor of the meat just right. \u00a0Every so often I'd swing over to the coleslaw for a moment, and going back to the meat was like taking a first bite all over again, and that's something you'll probably appreciate as much as I did. \u00a0The mac and cheese is great, crusted with bread crumbs and dense cheese sauce, the cornbread is excellent, and the fries are simple quality, but if you pass up the ridiculously wonderful cobbler for them you'll regret it. \u00a0Get the cobbler. \u00a0The baked beans are unusual, with an almost apple flavor and chunks of onion, but definitely good. \u00a0They're probably not for everyone, but I liked them a lot. \u00a0Oh, and get a sausage on the side. \u00a0They ship it in from Texas, and it's worth it. \u00a0The location is a little inconvenient, but it's well worth it. \u00a0The place could use a better sign for anyone coming from the north. \u00a0Even if you don't see it, just make a right on the first little street that isn't right up against the freeway embankment. \u00a0Still, the place is only a couple years old, the prices are reasonable, the service is good, and I'm looking forward to filling in any gaps when I go back yet again.", "Date": "2008-11-15", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jason P.", "ReviewID": "lez9-5x3-7y5TYfa5sN51Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely the best smoked brisket I've ever had anywhere in the country!

The inside is that of a simple, functional joint: tables and chair a little too close together, a self-serve machine for fountain drinks, and a counter where you place your order, pay your money, and pick up the goods when they call your name.How's the food? Mostly fantastic. Since I live west of the city, I usually get my BBQ fix at Famous Daves (used to go to Robinson's, but they've really slipped). And while FD's ribs, sides, variety of sauces, and service are always enjoyable, there's something else going on at Smoque that really knocked me out: depth. Where some ribs might offer you mostly the flavor of its sauce, the St. Louis ribs I had at Smoque had a deep smokiness that permeated the meat, followed by a savory and spicy rub, before I even got to the flavor of the sauce! Oh, and though Smoque doesn't have a table-full of sauces to choose from, the one they give you is worth a table full -- it's excellent. So the ribs alone were worth five stars.Several of the sides were up to this same high standard. The baked beans were delicious and sweet, with flavorful meat and carmelized onions. The french fries were terrific. And the peach cobbler in individual-size tins looked small but turned out to be the perfect size after gorging oneself on meat. In our visit, there were only a couple of misses: the Texas Sausage and the Brisket Chili were both perfectly fine but not home runs.Service, by the way, turned out to be an unexpected surprise. When I was undecided between St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, the unassuming mustachioed manager on the floor guided me to the former. And when the counter girl rang us out without beverages after mistakenly telling me they didn't have diet fountain drinks -- before I noticed that the fountain machine had Diet Coke clearly labeled -- Mustache Guy quickly gave me two cups.

Just a little bit disappointed. Not ridiculously so. I got a 1/2 slab of the St. Louis ribs, which Smoque recommends as their \"most authentic\" smoque experience with sides of mac n cheese, corn bread and slaw (I know. You just gained 5 lbs thinking about that, didn't you?)My husband got the pulled pork with sides of the BBQ beans, corn bread and slaw.My ribs were good. I liked the tangy sauce, but I didn't need a lot of it because the meat was smoked well, so it wasn't dry. The meat was tender and while I find the description of meat as \"falling off the bone\" pretty disgusting, this meat did come off easily without being too fatty. They're really the only reason I am giving Smoque 3 stars instead of 2 (even with the extra star for smell alone). The pulled pork was just ok. I'm biased because my husband makes a delicious pulled pork and I didn't think Smoque's was any better than his. The sides were, well, meh. \u00a0The mac n cheese didn't have much flavor to it, and I am not a fan of the bread crumb topping at all. Come to think of it, the corn bread didn't have much flavor either. It was pretty dry and I have had better from a box from Trader Joes. Husband said the beans were good, I thought they were just ok. Honestly, the slaw was pretty bad. I thought I would like it more because it's not too saucy, which is good for me considering that in my version of hell, everything is covered in mayo. But it just wasn't good. The cabbage pieces were too large and again didn't have a good flavor. I took two bites and offered the rest to my husband, who will eat pretty much anything, and even he declined. Oh well. We called ahead and picked it up, so I didn't have to wait in the line out the door when we got there. I just walked right up to the pick up counter, paid my $30 and got out of there. I'm glad I didn't have to wait very long. So, all in all, Smoque was just as the rating says, \"A-OK\".

It's been over a week since we came here for lunch and I'm still raving about how awesome Smoque is. We knew going in that this place served up some great BBQ, but it was above and beyond anything I expected.Coming off fresh from a BBQ disaster elsewhere (review to come), I was a bit skeptical. Could it be possible to eat BBQ without fat oozing everywhere and feeling like a disgusting glutton? The answer is YES!Atmosphere:We were prepared for a long wait and were pleasantly surprised at how quick the line was moving. I think it helped that additional seating was available in the outdoor patio. Cleanliness definitely caught my eye. Also, it was nice that the staff take on the task of finding you a seat after you order. It not only helps to avoid confrontations for \"seat saving\" for instance, but also helps to keep things moving.Food:I ordered the half &half with one side. This sandwich gives you the best of both worlds and is perfect for someone like me that can never make a decision. One half of the sandwich was of the brisket while the other half was of the pulled pork. Brisket - deliciously moist and tender. Be sure to order it sliced since it's a bit juicier than the chopped.Pulled pork - More of the same awesomeness. I was amazed at how little fat at all (if any) was on any of the meat. The BBQ sauce - the perfect mix of spicy, tangy, smoked BBQ. Yum! I really like how they give you a separate container of it which is perfect for dipping.I substituted the coleslaw for corn bread (YES!) and got the side of fries. The fries were huge; enough to feed at least 3 people.

We got there around 5:00 and had to wait a good 20 minutes to put in our order. By the time we left around 6:15, the line was literally down the block.Between the two of us, we ordered a pulled pork sandwich, a half rack of St. Louis ribs, and a tasting portion of the brisket. Our sides were baked beans (which we both agreed were the best thing we ate) and macaroni and cheese. I thought the pulled pork was absolutely fantastic. One note on the macaroni--you can get a small (one aluminum tin) or large (two aluminum tins, aka the large is twice the size as the small). The small is what comes with the entrees. So, if you're getting one of the sandwiches, it's actually more advantageous to order the sandwich a la carte and then a large macaroni on the side. It's much more macaroni bang for your buck (and yes, it's delicious).The seating situation is not a big deal at all.

Just wanted to say that.I have heard of this place a lot, and especially lately the idea of BBQ was just exciting. After spending the day tooling around I was hungry. And I was given this among 4 places.I'm babbling. Took the Blue Line. Walked down the back stairs. From the smell of piss and CTA, you get a whiff of the BBQ from nearly two blocks away. I was excited.We walked the two blocks and took our place in queue like good boys and girl. The line was out the door, but what I quickly realized is most people do take-away. We stood. And waited. Around the corner you see the simple menu. By the time you get to cash register, you should know.We placed our order. Someone asks you if you're staying or going. He'll point you to your table (family style so be warned). We got our 12oz cups at the all-you-can-drink dispenser and patiently waited for our order to come out.At the table, we got a bit of all animals to enjoy: the half-chicken, the brisket and the ribs with a side of sausage. The sides were mac 'n' cheese, fries and beans. We all got the complimentary slaw and a side bucket-sito of the sauce.When our number was called, we marveled at the aluminum trays. And everything was amazing! My wife had the chicken and she actually ate the skin... Which she NEVER does. I had the brisket and it was so tender. And the ribs were not fall-off-the-bone but they were amazingly delicious. The mac 'n' cheese were as everyone says simply divine. No complaints here.The bit is: if you order a human-sized portion you don't walk out of there waddling. It's the right amount of food. The BBQ sauce isn't that thick Kansas City stuff either. It's definitely on the tangy side and a bit sweet. And those beans. MMMMMMFFFF! So good!This place is BYO and folks live it up, most bringing a six-pack of what I believe is beer.

I love the layout and presentation of the food. You order a dish and it comes with two sides, or you can get them a la carte. When your order is ready, it's presented on a tray lined with wax paper and the sides come in their separate containers so that there's no cross contamination of different dishes (not that I mind that at all). \u00a0The portions appear small, but if you're visiting and want to try a little bit of everything, the smaller portions are excellent for that. My favorite was the corn bread, BBQ beans, peach cobbler and the St. Louis Ribs. The St. Louis ribs are to die for. I've yet to have a tender, slide off the bone rib since I lived in Texas. So this place, being NOT anywhere near Texas and having an assortment of BBQ and sides definitely made my 30~ minute drive from our hotel near Lake Michigan worth it. We also ordered chili soup, pulled pork, bbq chicken, fries, slaw and mac and cheese. Also, if you want to try something, but not sure if you want to order the WHOLE order, there's a few items you can \"sample\" for an additional cost at the end of the middle panel. That is what I did with the St. Louis Ribs. Afterwards I wished I had gotten the WHOLE RACK!The restaurant was super busy when I arrived, but there were associates who were nice enough to anticipate your seating and dining needs that they actively reserve a table for you, so that by the time you're done ordering your food, your table is ready, you eat, and then ready to head out and enjoy the rest of the beautiful city! The process is so efficient that I don't know why other restaurants don't follow their method.I was pleasantly surprised that our peach cobbler was still CRISPY even after it had been waiting on our tray for over an hour as we finished our mounds of BBQ goodness. Oh and a BBQ meal isn't complete without sweet tea! I will definitely be back for more BBQ next time I'm in Chi Town.

I eat anything fatty and succulent and this perfect cut delivers. It is always tender and spiced well enough to eat alone. I get the sauce on the side. I think the pulled pork is pretty good too. Once, they had *Burnt Ends as a special, which essentially is the fatty end of the brisket cooked and sauced a bit differently. I loved it, but alas it isn't a regular item due to supplier constraints.

The limited choices on the menu also told me that they took time into preparing these few things.We ordered the St. Louis ribs with 2 sides and the Half-Half Sandwich. Perhaps it was when we went (late afternoon), but the brisket (chopped only) was dry and the ribs was not as tender. The sides (fries, BBQ beans and Mac and Cheese) was good, but I can't distinguish between gourmet Mac and Cheese and Kraft's.I'm giving it a 3 star because of the potential and because of the home-style cooking (as opposed to pre-processed stuff).

I previously tried to visit the restaurant, but found a line outside and around the building. I kept going. On a Sunday evening at 7:00 P.M., I met friends there and found the line extending just outside the door.It took about 30-minutes to reach the cashier to place our order. There was an employee keeping tabs on the line trying to arrange proper seating for the groups. I counted at least 14-employees, which I find incredible for a restaurant of this small size. I would estimate the restaurant occupies no more than 2,000 square feet. I doubt the seating capacity exceeds 50 - 60 patrons.You place your order with a cashier, find a seat and wait for your number to be called. Once you place your order, there isn't much of a wait. Fountain drinks are self-service and located close to diners.I ordered a sliced brisket sandwich with cole slaw and baked beans. My wife ordered a pulled-pork sandwich with cole slaw and macaroni and cheese. We shared a small order of fries.The brisket was servied on a soft, dinner-style bun. The meat was flavorful, tender and smokey. It wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce, but we were each provided with extra sauce in a plastic container. The sauce is thin and vinegar-based--southern style. The cole slaw is also vinegar-based and very sweet. The baked beans were very smokey--much too smokey for my taste. The french fries were fresh cut and served in a small paper bag. They were excellent, except this batch was over salted. The pulled pork was flavorful with a nice crust of bark. Our tab was under $23.00.Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I had hoped for a better dining experience. With painted concrete floor and metal roof ceiling, the crowded restaurant was loud and difficult to carry on a conversation. Although a patron standing in line interrupted our meal to ask about the french fries. Barry, one of the owners, stopped by to ask how everything was. He was friendly and proud of his food and spoke about their efforts to maintain consistency. How to improve things (IMHO)...Find a larger location with adequate parking. It took ten to fifteen minutes to find a place to park on the street and another thirty minutes to reach the cashier to place my order.Cut back on the smoke a little--especially on the baked beans. My guess is they're using liquid smoke in the beans and it's overwhelming.

For sides we got the cornbread and the mac and cheese, which come in little metal containers that they're baked in, so everything stays really moist. The bread was full of flavor and had pieces of corn in it, and the mac and cheese had a great topping. Now, the really amazing thing about Smoque is their customer service. When we got home, we realized we had gotten sausage instead of our chicken, and the people on the phone insisted on delivering the chicken to us, AND brought us a gift certificate for our troubles.

The topping is crispy and almost like a baked granola that you have to break to get to the fresh tangy peaches and sweet cobbler beneath. It was very good!

I grew up on the south side of the city so I can assure you that there are quite a few BBQ joints that are really good. \u00a0The difference between Smoque and other BBQ joints is that the real BBQ joints have just a few tables and maybe some stools but most of the time you have to stand and eat. \u00a0Also Smoque has the power of advertising and yelp definitely helps.

With that being said people are really missing good BBQ in the city.I thought Smoque was decent and I think it is a welcome addition to the North side for BBQ. Keep in mind that this is just my opinion. I would never bash a restaurant because I think that we all have different taste buds. I had a place in North Chicago/Waukegan area called Big Ed's and let me tell you that I loved Big Ed's better than Smoque but I am sure that there are people who would go to Big Ed's and say that it was just ok and they like Smoque better.

Maybe I'm a tad bias because one of the owners lives down the block from me but regardless Smoque is worth the wait, worth the money, worth its weight in gold.

It's like a little getaway in your mouth.My mother bought some pulled pork and chili for a family dinner last night and boy was it decadent. They even gave us their rolls to make sandwiches with. I had to reheat my meat since I came home late but even then it was to-die-for. You know something's good when it tastes amazing even when it's microwaved! Only gripe is that the sauce is kinda watery, but the upside to that is that the bread sops up the sauce that much better, making every bite count. Also wish they would've given us more sauce, I could've used it to dip some random things in...it is THAT good. Just do me a favor and get your tush over to Smoque. You won't regret it!

My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Other than that, I have nothing but positive things to say about this small storefront in the Old Irving Park neighborhood. My family goes to Smoque on an average of once/week: on the way to school, on the way home from school and at various times in between. My 8-year-old would probably rank this as his #1 restaurant in the neighborhood -- we go for a bag of piping hot, fresh-cut fries to share on the way home from school on Friday afternoons. My 4-year-old prefers Hot Woks, Cool Sushi, but he's unlikely to turn down a side of Smoque mac & cheese -- served with a nice crust of breadcrumbs on the top. My 6-year-old, a latent picky eater, turns up her nose at the kids' mac & cheese (served without the breadcrumbs and therefore a bit runnier)...and then promptly finishes the bowl. The portions at Smoque are generous, almost to a fault. I usually order from the children's menu, opting for a mini brisket sandwich (both chopped and sliced are great) & fries and a side of crunchy cole slaw. I'm sated, but not overfull and it makes a weekday lunch at Smoque more affordable. If a giant portion of meat is not your thing, the salad -- with or without smoked chicken (unavailable otherwise) -- is pretty tasty. I've tried about 85% of their menu and it's all great. My husband likes the ribs and baked beans and my oldest child digs the pulled pork sandwiches. I do not like the mayonnaise-y cole slaw served in most restaurants, but I love Smoque's vinegar-and-honey version. Communal seating may bother some -- especially if you happen to be in on a Tuesday afternoon with a crowd of Chicago's finest in uniform -- although it minimizes wasted space in a popular restaurant where there is pretty much always a line. However, I've had some lucky accidents in seating arrangements and am seated next to or see someone I know three times out of five. Smoque also provides catering for private parties.

NEVER in TX or KC...or at my pop's restaurant where BBQ is available on tables and/or in pumps where you can dispense your own into cups. \u00a0Perhaps I missed pumps that may have been near the fountain soda station? \u00a0But I don't believe this was the case judging by my half filled plastic cup of sauce served with my meal. \u00a0 When my sauce DID run out (because let's be honest, it always does when rationed like that) \u00a0I worried, \"Are they going to charge me for BBQ sauce...at a BBQ restaurant?!\" \u00a0Please say it ain't so!! \u00a0 This was the case for Smokin' Woody's and I have never been back. \u00a0It's unforgivable. \u00a0Does McDonald's charge for ketchup? \u00a0Hot Doug's for mustard? But what really bugs about the no BBQ sauce readily available is the inconvenience of stopping mid-meal to get up and get more, most likely having to wait for whoever may be ordering at the counter at the time to finish. \u00a0All the while my delicious meats get cold. \u00a0Additionally, it appears they have two types of BBQ sauce but I have no idea if I was served the Original or the Spicy. \u00a0I would have liked to try both, but in the end tried....????? \u00a0No idea. \u00a0I cannot confirm whether I would have been charged for additional sauce. \u00a0I never wanted to leave my meat to ask which speaks to how amazing the food is (or rather, what an oinker I am). \u00a0But Smoque, I've gotta know - what gives with this set up? \u00a0 It left this BBQ fan a bit disappointed.", "Date": "2013-02-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Angela S.", "ReviewID": "WZiLYnHCRFPwMECHTp7RzA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The ambiance isn't the greatest, but I recommend dinner here before a show at the Abbey.

I have been here once so far and that day was the White Sox home opener after the game. I got the sliced brisket platter which came with coleslaw and 2 sides which I choose to be the brisket chili and the mac n cheese. I also got a taste of pulled pork.1. sliced brisketExtremely tender, could barely pick it up with my fork. had good flavor. first brisket i've ever had so I didn't have anything to compare it too but It wasnt as juicy as I had hoped but it was by no means dry. Decent size portion with the slaw and 2 sides. 4/52. coleslawDAMN good slaw. I believe I am the slaw nazi because I am always critical of it, and I don't like vinegar based so much, but boy do they know what they are doing. Simple. One type of cabbage chopped not shredded like crazy, and some thinly sliced red onion. Little bit of pepper the slightly vinegary base, can't go wrong. Not drenched not too peppery. Only complaint was that I wanted MORE! 5/53. mac n cheeseTiny portion, but ooooh so good. Nice breadcrumb crust on top and very creamy in the middle. You can tell its homemade, because of the color and flavor (real cheese), and can taste the love. Again only complaint tiny portion which i'm going to say takes half a point this time. 4.5/54. brisket chiliGood spices, decent heat, nice sized bowl. Hardly any meat though just basically tomatoes and spices with a chili like broth. Tasty but not a chili that one should be proud of. The one low point of the meal. 2.5/55. pulled porkGood pulled pork. You can defiantly taste the smoke especially in the dark crust which tastes like a smokey bacon. The flavor was a bit one dimensional though. 3.5/5Overall a pretty good place, might not go out of my way to get back there but after a sox game sure. Good price for lots of good food, about 12 dollars for all of that plus a drink.

How about a Texas style sliced brisket sandwich with a side of BBQ Beans? Or a slab of St. Louis style ribs with fresh cut french fries and mac and cheese? Everything, whether it was an entree or a side, was consistently fabulous each time I went.

Overall, the experience was fantastic. I'll mix it up and start with my complaints first. I only had two small issues with this place. First, the ordering/seating was a little disorganized, especially since it was pretty busy. It ended up working out fine, and we got our food quickly, but it was just a little disorganized and confusing. Second, we got a \"taster portion\" of the ST. Louis ribs. They weren't the best I've ever had (*cough* they were no Twin Anchors *cough*.) They were a little tough--definitely not \"fall off the bone\" tender that I like. Now the positives: my husband and I each ordered the brisket plate. We were in agreement that it was the best brisket we ever had. The sides were also very solid: we got beans, mac and cheese and cornbread. I thought the beans were the standout (I pretty much drank the extra sauce in the cup at the end) and my husband thought the mac and cheese was the best. All of the sauces were fabulous as well: we stuck with the Carolina and the \"Spicy\" Memphis. Bottom line, I'll definitely be back here.

I loved the vinegar based sauce, it is not hot or sweet, the right amount of flavor to compliment the pork. The chicken was good as well, although a little dry. The chicken had a nice smoky flavor to it. The sauce that came with the chicken was thicker and sweeter, it was good. We got a side of brisket. I've only had BBQ brisket once before at a South Carolina style BBQ place in Maryland. This brisket was UNBELIEVABLE. When ordered we were asked \"sliced or chopped\" we opted for sliced. The flavor of the meat, the smokiness of it and the melt in your mouth tenderness was too much! The side portion of it was generous and I may be a brisket convert. The cole slaw was vinegar based. It tastes like rice vinegar, celery seed and has thin slices of red onion which adds a pop of flavor. The cole slaw is different - \u00a0in a good way - \u00a0very refreshing. \u00a0I am an expert on baked beans, have had many excellent variations of them home made and out, but these rocked my world.

I wanted to head back on the kennedy to grab more before they closed. I restrained myself. But from now on large side of baked beans, maybe 2, one to eat later in the week might be a treat.

I have to say that the pork without any additional sauce would have been just fine but once you add in the sauce, WOW! It was delicious! The pork was moist and the sauce was so flavorful. I also very much enjoyed the cornbread and actually saw some kernels of corn inside which made me appreciate the flavor even more.My husband ordered the same pulled pork but I do believe SOMETHING must be said about how amazing the mac and cheese is. No joke, it's amazing. If we ever venture back to Smoque, I will be ordering that M&C because it has this lovely crumble layer on top like a panko bread crumb and it's so cheesy!

Anyway...Went in around 245 on a Sunday and there was a line that ran up to the entrance with almost all tables occupied. After placing my takeout order I stood close to where the food was going out and I have to say the efficiency of the restaurant is very good and the way it should be. All too often I observe issues at different places of business that could be fixed so simply!When my order was called I found a well packed brown paper bag and asked if the sauces and both \"taste\" portions were in, the girl at the counter gave me an assured yes and that was enough for me!I came home to find everything I ordered!FOOD:Chicken - I think this may be the best chicken preparation I have ever had, it originally was taken by the Publican, but I think in terms of chicken, Publican has to take a 2, albeit a VERY high 2. The chicken looks EXACTLY like it does on their site, perfectly moist, smoked and they browned exterior carrying a ridiculous amount of flavor. I will not go to Smoque and ever not get it.St. Louis taste - love the taste option here and love the fairly hard to find St. Louis rib which was DELICIOUS.Brisket - I love brisket, but not sure if I've ever had any that rocks my world, I get it when I get bbq. It was good, wish the top layer of fat was slightly thinner, although it's not thick by any means.Coleslaw - I wish they would chop it after its shredded, great flavor but think theirs would benefit from a confetti cut.Mac & Cheese - It's good, very good, but my personal preference is a \"drier\" style with less cream, rue like binding. I get disappointed by most macs, and I am grateful that I can be satiated by a few bites!Peach cobbler - OMG - will get it every time, it's divine.The food is GREAT, I think in terms of all the barbecue spots in the city outside of Chicago Q and Lilie Q since I haven't been, SMOQUE is KING!Glad to see this place thriving I wish they had a food truck and other locations, I don't see why they couldn't open up 3-5 other locations throughout and not do well!", "Date": "2013-01-20", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sima F.", "ReviewID": "8EoOQ9JmD12gaPzDv75Iug", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best brisket ever!!!", "Date": "2013-02-22", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Ron T.", "ReviewID": "uespowEDPpOqcqtndTFD2g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hands down the best BBQ joint in Chicago. \u00a0Super tasty. \u00a0Very consistent. \u00a0Awesome sides. \u00a0Don't stuff yourself silly with ribs and brisket without trying the mac and cheese, peach cobbler, or dipping your fries in brisket chili. \u00a0This place is legit.", "Date": "2012-11-15", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Gabe M.", "ReviewID": "joCJs9VQZZGm4u-BPLp7gA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the simple nature of this place. \u00a0Great BBQ. \u00a0Great selection. \u00a0Low key. \u00a0Whats not to like?", "Date": "2013-01-20", "Author_Location": "Aurora, IL"}, {"Author": "Evelyn S.", "ReviewID": "pAkODJYx_iwshPsxgIw0rQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These folks catered my friend's recent NYE party. \u00a0Great food. \u00a0I would highly recommend their catering for a casual event. \u00a0We ended up with WAY more food than we needed and the ribs, in particular were amazing.", "Date": "2014-01-07", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Keith C.", "ReviewID": "hrAdDK6fyPEBl1c8rBLU8w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What makes this one of the best bbq places in chicago is the variety. \u00a0You dont get this type of variety at other bbq places. \u00a0Other places might have better items singuarly, but you have to look at the whole when you come here. \u00a0Add to that great service, its a no brainer. \u00a0I just wish they had more seating, because this place deserves it.", "Date": "2013-12-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Steven R.", "ReviewID": "aW_r44--M3XlcshLmEGfog", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great bbq. the sliced brisket is a must try, but all of it is good there.", "Date": "2014-01-06", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Ed M.", "ReviewID": "5u-CgDP_phAYieGFgGzpYg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great food.

It should be illegal for anything to be this darn good! Let's state the facts. 1). I really enjoy BBQ 2). I really enjoy good BBQ 3). I really enjoy Texas Style BBQ 4). Smoque is the best place in Chicago for really amazing Texas style BBQ. I was expecting some fancy joint with pretty good BBQ. Well, that isn't what I got. Smoque is all about the BBQ, it isn't about the d\u00e9cor or being fancy. Smoque is BBQ all the way. I ordered the \u00a01/2 slab of St. Louis Ribs with baked beans and mac & cheese, my boyfriend ordered the sliced brisket French fries and cornbread. Let's start with the ribs, they were perfectly cooked. When I say perfectly cooked, that is exactly what I mean. Perfectly cooked ribs DO NOT fall off the bone. Instead they are tender and easy to bite off the bone. I don't like it when I get a rib and the meat falls off, I also don't want to hurt myself trying to eat tough ribs. Smoque's ribs were perfect. The brisket was equally tasty. Fork tender, plastic fork tender!! What? And the bark is amazing. The Mac & Cheese is fantastic, I wish the portions were bigger, it reminded me of my grandmothers Mac & Cheese (and hers is FANTASTIC), so to compare them is a real compliment. The BBQ baked beans were so good! They don't sell that goodness in a can that is for sure. The Fries were fresh cut and cooked to perfection and the cornbread was also fantastic. Next time I will try the pulled pork and the baby back ribs. Heck I might just order one of everything so I don't miss out!

I had heard of the restaurant on yelp, and was eager to try their ribs.I never blame a place for being popular, but Smoque is too small (a picture taken in January clearly illustrates this). It can seat about 20 on the left, and about 40 on the right, but the tables and chairs are really close to each other. It's hard to move around when the place is busy (this is an understatement), and you may also find yourself waiting to be seated (there are some chairs by the restrooms, and people were constantly walking by my wife and I).A portly man (I'm going to talk about him some more in a bit) was less impressed than I was. He asked someone, probably the owner, if the restaurant could be expanded. He even suggested that the business next door be bought out (he was politely told that it's hard to buy out a dentist's office). \u00a0There are only 2 registers, and the line was almost out the door when we arrived (there were 5 of us, and I'm glad that other customers were respectful of John's daughters- he had 2 at the time, but 3 now). It didn't move very quickly, and it always reached the door or beyond while we were there (we were inside for a good hour). Anyway, it took us about 10 minutes to order.+The menu is small, but diverse enough (ribs, chicken, brisket, pulled pork, Texas sausage). I should have ordered some Texas sausage, but I didn't know that the sausages are really hot links at the time.There's a salad on the menu (a small is $5.45, and you can add chicken for $2.50 more), and John took advantage of the Kids Menu (it consists of 2 meals and Mac & Cheese).There are 6 sides to choose from (ex: BBQ Beans; Fresh Cut Fries), and 1 dessert item (Peach Cobbler).+You can Add a Taste (a meat to your meal or salad) for only $3 or $4 (the latter is for 3 or 4 St. Louis Ribs).+The staff works hard (one of the food preparers was sweating). When we came in, the cashiers were all business (I expected this), but quick and attentive, and some guys worked diligently to seat people.The food preparers also have a good system going. We ordered over $70 worth of food, but nothing was missing or wrong.+The prices are reasonable (ex: with slaw and 2 sides, a Half Chicken Platter is $11.45).+/-The portions are solid, but not great. Big eaters like me need to spend about $20 here.-There's very limited parking. Thankfully, we were able to park in front of a building that was just about a block away.-The selection of drinks is limited. The soda fridge contains bottled water and about 4 types of soda, and the soda fountain features 6 or 7 selections (if the restaurant is busy, it can be a pain getting to it- it's in the back).St. Louis Ribs (with slaw and 2 sides, a Half Slab is $13.45): 8/10.They're meaty and flavorful (they'll demand that your taste buds take notice), but I actually found them to be too strong in taste (my wife liked them more). Some of our ribs were also a tad burnt.The BBQ sauce we had on the side was pretty good, but light.They're a little more expensive (a Full Slab with slaw and 2 sides is $21.95), but Baby Back Ribs can also be ordered. They're smaller, but possibly better (they've evidently \"been king in Chicago for years\").Pulled Pork Platter ($10.45 with slaw and 2 sides): 8.5/10.The meat is good and not overpowering in taste. I liked it more than them, but I know that the \"kick\" the St. Louis Ribs provide wows most people (this was the case with my wife). Mac & Cheese: 8/10.Different (because of the crust and crumbs, a container of it resembles a piece of pie), but fairly good. A popular side.Fresh Cut Fries (a large is $2.95): 7.5/10.Not bad, but not spectacular. They're easy to eat and enjoyable enough.Cornbread: 7/10.BBQ Beans: 7/10. Both sides are just okay. The portly man came in with his wife. He may have been a food critic (he came across as an uptight snob who wanted to be catered to- he and his wife were also overly dressed). The owner apologized to him (the man and his wife waited awhile to be seated), but to no avail.Anyway, the man was seated at our table, and he didn't like being so close to John's daughters (he may have noticed that they were sick, but I think this really had to do with them being playful- still, they were pretty quiet and didn't make contact with anyone). The final straw came when John was helping a guy bus our area. A napkin fell on the man (it landed by his hands), and he could barely restrain himself (the napkin, by the way, hadn't been used). Anyway, John and I knew that it was \"time to go\" (I'm sorry, but I hope his food gave the man the runs).The layout is poor, but Smoque lives up to its name. The meat is cooked \"Low And Slow,\" and is very smokey. If you have to wait, your food will be worth it for the most part.

The Brisket tasted better than it did on my last visit. The place was packed on the Sunday afternoon I made my visit. But they did a real nice job getting everybody seated. They held your order until you got a table so your food was served up nice and hot. I ordered the Brisket and a side of a Chili. The Chili was listed as the special side of the day. The Chili was fabulous. It was made with Beans, Brisket and onions. It had a nice kick to it. The Brisket was a decent sized sandwich. The Dry Rub they used was tasty. The sauce they use is decent but It could use a bit more heat. I added some Hot sauce to mine to give it a little more of a bite. All things considered, it was a pretty good sandwich. \u00a0The bottom line is that Smoque is a nice alternative to the more expensive BBQ joints in Chicago. It's a bare bones dining experience.

The brisket...oh...perfect pink smoke ring, gorgeous bark, tender juicy meat. \u00a0There isn't a brisket in town that can top it. \u00a0The Texas Link IS a Texas Link. \u00a0Holy moly, I thought I was at some German smokehouse in Texas when I ate that thing - beautifully marbled with fat, smokey, juicy, and a natural casing that gives it a fantastic snap.

The sauce, btw, is fantastic, but I definitely prefer the lighter Carolina based one. \u00a0My one quibble is the lack of white bread - god intended us to eat white bread with our BBQ, dammit, could you just dole out a couple of slices of wonder bread with the cue, please?Pricey, but 1 rib dinner, 1 brisket dinner and a side of pulled pork and a Texas link fed myself and my husband for nearly 3 days, so overall a very good value. \u00a0Compared to my beloved Salt Lick, this is a four star joint.

OK, now that I got that out the way. We are (wannabe) serious BBQ freaks that find just about any reason in the world to throw ribs on the grill. Although my country style ribs, tenderly loved and slow cooked, are the talk of family, friends and neighbors (straight southerners - which is a compliment), I have yet to get all into the \"BBQing every part of a cow and pig\" . I promise to do so this summer .... No, you are not invited. At work that morning I was going through reviews on Cuban food when for some odd reason, I ended up looking at a bunch of BBq reviews. I get home and tell my wife to pack up the lil hunie and we headed off to Smoque. I have to admit that the first reviews were given to us by my in-laws about 1 year ago. When we first walked in, I finally understood why people are always touching on the space issue. Yes, it is fairly small and thinly furnished, which is fine with me. Luckily we went around 4pm and it was pretty empty....Goood! The crew was all smiles and seemed upbeat, which is a plus when we visit a new place. Smiles make reviews like this, go up that half a star. The food - Places that get this much attention, usually worry me because they quickly forget about the quality and go for the profits. That was not the case with smoque. We ordered the full slab of baby back ribs, (sides-included) mac and cheese (of course), BBQ beans, cornbread and fries. First off , the mac and cheese is yummy. I rate my mac and cheese on crust only, which this one - had the best. The beans were good but my wife (the bean lover) did not have much of a reaction from them, so I will leave them as OK. The ribs were very tasty and cooked with just the right amount of burn to them. The ribs get a thumbs up from me. I ordered some brisket but in the rib eating frenzy, it got cold, I will leave that rating out. I asked my wife if she wanted to try the pulled pork and she gave a \"I am about to explode\" yes. The pulled pork sandwich is the best!!!! GO PULLED PORK SANDWICH! The pork melts in you mouth and the sauce (with a touch of Tabasco added by me) is killer! The only negative I have about this joint, is the serving sizes. I know what you are thinking \"he is a big guy\", but my wife is petite and thought the same thing. I can pop the serving of mac and cheese or the cornbread, into my mouth like a tic tac.

I heard about the journey the owner's took that eventually ended up as Smoque. The when I saw that they served beef brisket, my first thought was these guys have a death wish. I can tell you first hand (as many others could as well) is that brisket is VERY difficult to do properly. There isn't much margin for error, especially when working with a Packer's cut brisket (both flat and point cuts together). I've seen so many people and places try to do it and fail terribly (under/over spiced, poor blend of seasonings & overcooked being most common). They did what most people should do- go to the people and learn how to BBQ properly. The brisket was moist, properly seasons (one spice didn't overpower the other- I wasn't trying to figure it out, I just wanted to eat). If you spend a few extra dollars, you can get a nice slaw and two sides. The mac & cheese was rock solid. I decided to go with fries and they were also very good (note- I don't eat fries much anymore, so someone else finished them off for me). If you say you can make a good brisket but whiff, news will travel FAST!! So my next visit, I decided to do something else. I bought the smoky Texas sausage (actually, I wanted to just take a bite and take the rest back home). Not too spicy but smooth (it could be spicy for others with much lower tolerance for heat). I had the St Louis ribs my next visit. These ribs are fantastic!! I could say they could stack up with the legends in this area. The ribs were not fall off the bone but nice and tender (I think fall off the bone took a wrong turn from what was originally meant; I believe fall off the bone meant pulling away from the bone NOT literally falling off the bone). For the record, I'm not a pulled pork fan (when I BBQ it, I prefer to slice it; pulled pork not bad but just prefer sliced). Bottom line. The spot is pretty visible and easy to get to.

After yet another fine meal at Smoque, I had to do it some justice and give back by writing a stellar review. Summary: It is a BYOB that serves BBQ - that's it! They don't have burgers, chicken wings, gyros, or hot dogs, because that is not what they do. I am tired of reading reviews that complain about not having a steak or a burger on the menu. Its a BBQ joint, not a steak house...get over it! Anyway, back to the topic I love and know well...BBQ! Smoque caters to the traditional BBQ lover. It has pulled pork, brisket, ribs (baby back and St. Louis style), hot links, chicken, and a few simple sides that are all outstanding. \u00a0Based on what type of meat you order, they have a sauce type that is specific to each meat. While you can stray from this sauce, you should give it a try as it was specially designed to compliment the meat (not over power it). They cook and base their sauce on the geographic region that is most well known for the meat: Pulled Pork - Carolinas Brisket and Hot Links - Texas Ribs - St. Louis and Memphis They have done their home work because I have eaten at some of the best BBQ joints in all of those regions and can say that Smoque does a good, if not better, job than some of the best BBQ joints in that area. The best tell tale sign of a good BBQ is if the meat can stand alone and not require sauce. Well, I have to say, Smoque's meat stands on its own like a new graduate from the Marines. It has an outstanding rub and is smoked to perfection. The portions are very reasonable as is the price. And if you can't make up your mind on what to order, you can add a \"taste\" of any of their meats for a small charge. Food: Pulled Pork - Great! As with all of their meats, it is available as a sandwich or a platter. It is tender, smokey, and has a good mixture of juicy center pork with the crunchier, spice rubbed outer part of the shoulder. Classic pulled pork with a thin vinegar based sauce which compliments the meat well. Brisket - Smoque's most famous item and what they do best. The brisket beats almost all of the Texas BBQ places I have been to. It is available sliced or chopped. The sliced brisket is juicier and so excellent. The chopped brisket is from the end of the brisket and is much leaner and probably my favorite thing on the menu. The sauce is a thicker sauce that is pretty tangy and should be used sparingly. Ribs - The ribs are amazing. They offer both St. Louis style and Baby Back style ribs. The baby backs are a little smaller, leaner, and a tad bit more money, while the St. Louis ribs are a little larger. St. Louis ribs get a bad rap for being fatty, but not at Smoque. They are pre-trimmed and are almost as lean, if not leaner, as the Baby Backs. In fact, if you ask the owners, they will probably steer you to try the St. Louis ribs. I always order the St. Louis ribs unless they are out of them. They are meatier, tastier, and just great. The ribs are not the typical boiled/broiled Chicago style ribs that my Gramma can eat without her dentures. Rather, they have a little \"tug\" to them, as Smoque puts it, and a great texture; the way ribs ought to be. The outer part of the rib has a really nice crust to it from the rub and the smoking process. The ribs are one item I never use sauce for...I always eat them dry. If you prefer the sauce, it is a thicker tomato based sauce and is somewhat of a hybrid of Memphis style and Kansas City style. It is pretty tasty, but as I mentioned, good ribs don't need sauce. Chicken - Well, its chicken and tastes like chicken. Decent, but not great. Why go to a BBQ joint to get chicken with all of the other options. Pass on the chix and go with the beef or pork items. Sausages/Hot Links - These were ok. I am not a huge fan of sausage, but they really didn't impress me at all. They really tasted very simple. \u00a0See above regarding the my recommendation on the chicken. \u00a0If you are a big sausage fan, then you might enjoy them. Beans - To die for! \u00a0They are so good! Smoque takes pieces of chopped brisket and onion and adds them to the beans. They then smoke the beans in the smoker to perfection. I have never had BBQ beans as good as these. Hands down! They definitely aren't your standard Bush beans from the can. This is the best side dish on the menu, in my opinion. Mac and Cheese - Well done indeed. They use fresh cheese and hand make it. They top it with bread crumbs and toast the top of it. I am not a huge Mac and Cheese guy, but if you are, this one will be a hit with you. Fries: Hand cut fries that are decent. \u00a0Unless you have to have fries, consider other options. Sauce: Overall, I will say the sauce is good. \u00a0Not the best I have had, but it does its job.Finally: \u00a0If you haven't already, check these guys out. They are the real deal and have great food. If you don't believe me, check out their BBQ Manifesto on their website.

I managed to arrive a little bit after they opened and beat the crowds. \u00a0Due to a lack of breakfast, an intense desire to sample everything on the menu, and that sense of abandon you sometimes feel on vacation, I ended up with an absolutely obscene smorgasbord of food sitting in front of me (check the pics). \u00a0Despite the grueling task facing me, I totally devoured all of it like a boss. \u00a0The Meat:- \u00a01/2 rack of baby back ribs - These were pretty good - maybe B+/A-. \u00a0They had a nice smokiness and bark to them. \u00a0The texture was solid (not extremely tough or \"falling off the bone\"), but they could have been a little more tender. Overall, they were tasty, but could've been a little better. \u00a0However, they were my favorite of the three meats I sampled. \u00a0- pulled pork - The pork was decent - a B-. \u00a0It was nicely-pulled, had a nice bit of smoke and was tender. \u00a0However, it was probably cooked a little too long as some parts were borderline mushy. \u00a0It also seemed to be a little underseasoned too me. \u00a0It was also served with the sauce already on - which is a no-no (good meat should be able to stand on its own). \u00a0 - brisket - This was fairly good - a solid B. \u00a0The flavor was pretty good on the brisket, but it had what I've found to be a common problem with brisket - dryness. \u00a0The brisket was a bit on the dry side. \u00a0It was also served with the sauce already on which in nearly all circumstance I don't like but here it didn't really matter since it helped combat the dryness. \u00a0 \u00a0The Other Stuff:- sauce - Not bad, but not really memorable either. \u00a0Kinda sweet, kinda vinegary. \u00a0- mac & cheese - I love m&c that has a crumbly/crunchy top so I really liked that aspect. \u00a0The rest underneath the crust was good as well, but didn't have the smooth gooeyness that I like. \u00a0Flavor was pretty good throughout. \u00a0- fries - The bag of fries the most impressive thing I ate there. \u00a0Who would expect it, right? \u00a0But seriously, they were excellent - hot, fresh, crispy on the outside/soft in the middle, well seasoned. \u00a0I wish everyone could do fries like this. \u00a0Maybe they were just really spot on that day with them though. \u00a0Who knows. \u00a0Dare I say - maybe the best I've had in '09?- cole slaw - Kudos to them for having a non-mayo-based coleslaw (mayo sucks). \u00a0It had a lot of potential to be really good, but it was so sour/tart that I couldn't eat much of it. \u00a0Lessen the acidity (lemon juice maybe?) and it'd be solid. \u00a0- peach cobbler - I didn't get a picture since I ordered it to-go afterwards and ate it later, but there is a pic of it already up. \u00a0Anyway, it was very good though a bit non-traditional for a cobbler (crumble top, somewhat heavily spiced). \u00a0- sweet tea - It was ok - better than I would expect for a Midwestern joint.Non-food Impressions- The staff seemed top-notch: competent, friendly, & helpful. - The restaurant is certainly nice enough for a bbq joint. \u00a0I like the large menu on the wall. \u00a0- The layout of the restaurant seems problematic though. \u00a0The arrangement of the line, the drinks, the food pickup, and the layout of the tables seems poor. \u00a0You have to go all over the place and through lots of people if it's crowded. \u00a0There's no logic or flow to it. \u00a0I didn't have the problem since there was hardly anyone there when I went, but I'd bet it's pretty chaotic when there's actually a bit of a crowd. \u00a0However, I realize that they might be doing the best they can with the space they have to work with so, if that's true, you can't fault them too much. \u00a0 Overall, Smoque was pretty tasty and serves up some good bbq. \u00a0I wouldn't be surprised if it's the best bbq that Chicago has to offer. \u00a0It's better than quite a few places in the A even. \u00a0Anyway, hitting up Smoque was definitely an adventure - and a satisfying one at that. \u00a0Smoke meat everyday.4[Ed.

The first time I went I ordered the ribs and I did not like their BBQ sauce, it was too tangy and full of Smoque flavor that to be honest it was overpowering for me. Their meat was hard to come off the bone, i felt like i was fighting it off the bone and was more chewy than tender. I did like the mac and cheese I just wish they would serve bigger sides, you can literally pick it all up at once with a spoon. The second time I had it, my family who lives 3 blocks away from there and heard the great reviews on it decided to order it for Christmas dinner. \u00a0I thought hey why not lets give it another try. We called to place an order but they weren't going to be open Christmas eve so we ended up buying frozen ribs from them to try to warm them up at home. BIG MISTAKE. the already \"ok\" ribs were now awful tasting , to say the least it was not a happy Christmas. So the third time I had Smoque BBQ, my boyfriend surprised me by ordering ribs for pick up there on a Saturday night, we barely made it there before they closed their doors to pick up the food and this time the ribs were the worst i had ever had. I don't know if it was because they were about to close already and they just gave us the last ribs they had, but they were hard full of fat and muscle that you are obviously supposed to take off before you cook, I have made ribs before so I know its sucks and its hard work to take off all the fat and muscle (it also depends where you buy them obviously) We were so disappointed, AGAIN!

Also if you think you're getting your own private table to eat your meal, don't count on it. A server walks through the line and gets a count for your party and somehow by the time you get to the front of the line to order your food there is a place to sit. We were set next to a nice couple who makes Smoque a regular stop on their way through the area. Now that you understand how the place runs let me tell you the food is nothing like fast food. The who meal was amazing and I suggest you get one thing and everyone else gets something else so you can sample a little of this and a little of that. Be aware though that they run out of stuff fast due to the fact that they make bbq the way it should be made, over hours or days of cooking. So when they are out, they are out til tomorrow. The food is good but a little pricey for what you get. I'd suggest getting take out and going home with your food so you don't have to pay way too much for your drink. This place blends a very interesting contraction in my head, that is it's runs people through as quick as McDonald's but has the taste and price scale of a higher end restaurant.

Nobody told me about it, and I didn't find it on urbanspoon or yelp. To be honest, I can't remember how I stumbled upon their website. Anyways, regardless of however I found this spot- there was no way I was going to pass up on a BBQ place. It was a few minute drive from Chicago downtown, so my friend and I decided to check it out.Smoque BBQ is known for their brisket and bbq ribs- but personally, I find briskets to be a little too dry for me. Since there were only two of us....I had to think really hard as to what I wanted to order before I visited the restaurant.Once I walked in, I was surprised to see the restaurant lay out. I was expecting a full service restaurant, but it was order and pay at front and sit whereever kinda thing. There was a guy from the restaurant guiding everybody and making sure everyone had tables, which was super helpful.Keep in mind that they don't let you sit down unless all of your party is present at the restaurant.Ordered: St Louis Rib 1/2 Combo with coleslaw + 2 sides* 1/2 St Louis Rib, coleslaw, mac n cheese and fries for $14.95* You can choose between Baby Back Ribs or St. Louis* They said St. Louis is the meatier and fattier cut so I went with that* If you choose a combo, you get to choose 2 sides other than a coleslaw* Sides are BBQ beans, mac n cheese, fries, brisket chili and corn bread* For $14.95, this combo was huge and it could be shared between 2 people (girls)* Ribs were kind of on the dry side, and the sauce was more so marinated into the meat rather than dripping from it* Explains why there was a side of bbq sauce on the side for you to dip in* It wasn't fall-off-the-bone type which I prefer, it was kind of disappointing* Coleslaw was light and refreshing but nothing special* Mac n Cheese was so good! it was small in portion but had the perfect consistency of cheeseyness and the crust on top was to die for* Fries were huge in portion, it was good but again- nothing special Ordered: 1/2 Pulled pork sandwich * 1/2 pulled pork sandwich for $4.95* This was better than I thought it'd be* Most pulled pork sandwiches I find it to be dry* But the pulled pork was so tender and juicy* I didn't really like the bun since it was toasted and made it a little messy to eat* They give you some more BBQ sauce on the side to use* BBQ sauce was tangy with the just right amount of sweetness and smokynessOrdered: Cornbread* Side for 95 cents* This went well with my meal and it was well made* It's made like a corn muffin which made it easier to eat* I could feel the texture of cornmeal when I ate it (how it's suppose to be)* If you like cornbread, it's def worth 95 cents!Summary: I looked around as I was eating my ribs and it seemed like a lot of people were getting the briskets (what they are known for). And they looked pretty damn good! It wasn't dry looking like the most briskets I've seen.

\u00a0To stop wasting your time waiting in line for an hour to get a big pile of brisket? \u00a0I'm afraid not. \u00a0However, I do have some fundamental issues to address in terms of Smoque's food, identity, authenticity and ambiance. \u00a0Let's get down to brass tacks. \u00a0I mean, after several visits, i've tried a large variety of things on the menu. \u00a0Brisket, links, pulled pork, ribs, and coleslaw. \u00a0I wouldn't dare say that any of these items are horrendous or poorly prepared. \u00a0Actually, the brisket is quite tasty, albeit incredulously rich. \u00a0The ribs and links were also pretty tasty. \u00a0Nonetheless, I really have failed to have my mind blown as many reviewers on yelp have. \u00a0Like I said, I would consider all of their smoked meats good, but nothing special. \u00a0As for the sides, I will say the mac is delicious. \u00a0So identity and authenticity? \u00a0Yeah, i've got a major bone to pick (no pun intended) with Smoque's whole business plan. \u00a0I don't know about yourself, but Barbecue to me is the embodiment of cultural identities throughout America. \u00a0It is localized and unique to each state, town, neighborhood and family. \u00a0It is something that tells a story and encapsulates a particular history and identity of many people(s). \u00a0Call me crazy, but i'm just not getting that sort of atmosphere out of Smoque. \u00a0To me, it is a truly Anglicized version of \"barbecue.\" \u00a0I mean, I really feel like the place and the food is very much contrived. \u00a0From the perfect little macaroni tins to the campy metal plate that you're served on, this place is on it's way to becoming Famous Dave's and propped up in every strip mall in Schaumberg. \u00a0It's not that the food is bad, but it's the homogenizing of barbecue into one spot. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, you can get Carolina style in Chicago. \u00a0Except that the owner was originally born in South Carolina, they moved to Chicago and brought all of their recipes and traditions with them. \u00a0You see where i'm going? \u00a0Texas, St. Louis, Chicago, and Carolina styles all under one roof? \u00a0It's just not right like it should be. \u00a0The atmosphere is also very much contrived. \u00a0It's something between a poorly planned lunch room cafeteria and a Chili's. \u00a0The wanna-be 'down-home' charm of rickety tables and too-close for comfort rib sucking is lost on me in a sea of table Nazi's demanding where you sit, excruciatingly blaring audibility and an overall frenzied environment. \u00a0It always seems like nobody really knows what's going on and it's not uncommon for someone to be moving tables back and forth throughout the restaurant while you're eating. \u00a0As well, it's nice that the owner walks around checking on his customers, but I am left to wonder: Is he strolling the restaurant to check on customers or is he just hoping someone still recognizes him from chillin' with TGIF-Friday's-Sling' Guy Fieri from the Food Network? \u00a0Burn. \u00a0What can I say? \u00a0I'm a bbq purist. \u00a0With that being said, i've had better food, authenticity, atmosphere both here in Chicago and elsewhere throughout this Barbecue-laden country.", "Date": "2008-07-14", "Author_Location": "Madison, WI"}, {"Author": "Chris S.", "ReviewID": "lafINc0vWZllHSTDsejZ7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has to be some of THE BEST bar b que we have ever had here in the Chicagoland area!!!!

Texas BBQ? Profiled on Food Network? Sounded like a no-brainer and we were excited about trying it out. It was an unusually hot and muggy June day (very Texas like), so the scene was set for a little reminder of home. Or at least that was the thought process...Smoque proves that just because something is profiled on Food Network, doesn't mean it's good. Or even adequate. Food Network jumped the shark on food integrity long ago. I'd estimate somewhere between The Next Food Network Star and Cupcake Wars. Thank God for Alton Brown - perhaps their only saving grace. Anyway - the food at Smoque was barely just ok. I'm no BBQ purist, but I will say I've been to numerous good AND crappy BBQ joints during my life, and Smoque would have trouble holding their own amidst the \"crappy\" category. Very sub-par for something featured on the Food Network. The sauce - often the crown jewel of a famous BBQ joint - was forgettable. Our group of four each ordered different meats and sides so we could share and get a more comprehensive tasting. We were all disappointed to say the least. The disappointment was severe considering the journey we took to get there (because of construction on some EL lines, we had to take two trains, a bus, and eventually a cab to get there). The food was hardly worth our Odyssey. Oh, and did I mention Smoque gave me food poisoning? I was sick for 3 days after eating there, effectively ruining a long weekend with friends in town.Now, I am a fan of the CONCEPT of \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.\" This, because of my general disdain for chain restaurants and my love of great little-known mom-and-pop places. I do a fair bit of travel for my job and if I was limited to Chilis and Applebees for all my meals I would lose my mind. But Food Network really does its viewers a disservice by featuring places like Smoque. They get away with it because they figure most viewers are unlikely to actually go to most of the places featured, and you can't taste or smell food through the TV set. Guy Fiere, albeit a decent TV host, is certainly no chef of record and all he does is kiss up to these places he features. He never plays the role of true critic, automatically discounting just about everything he features. Not to mention his abortion of a Sushi/BBQ (con)fusion restaurant, Tex Wasabi. Anyone stupid enough to fuse BBQ and Sushi has respect for neither BBQ or sushi. And he should really be ashamed of himself. But the Food Network is the machine which gives people like Fiere a voice to lead us all astray in our cullinary pursuits.So to summerize: Smoque BBQ - SKIP IT.

So far, the best brisket I have liked has been home crafted by true BBQ \u00a0lovers or a couple of joints in Texas, but the brisket here is actually the best I have ever had. Pulled pork was surprisingly sub-par. With all the place had going for it, it was a bit dry and tasted only like sauce (which is tasty) but not the porky goodness that I love. Served on a giant bun of Hawaiian bread that added a nice sweetness but was too fluffy and should have probably been a bit denser. The ribs (the larger St. Louis style) I love were great. Perfectly tender. There is this disgusting love for 'fall off the bone' ribs that makes people boil ribs to cook them then throw them in a smoker or on a grill. Boiled meat, people? What, are we English? no dude, it's gotta be smoked and thiers are amazingly tender but not sodden. really good and served with the Memphis style BBQ sauce.They have 2 sauces - Memphis style: sweet, molasses-y, thick and the South Carolina: thinner and vinegar-y. I usually prefer the tangier S Carolina, but theirs is tangy, but not much smoke or spice - The fell I was with said it was good on whatever he was eating. I found it to be 'meh' I actually really enjoyed the Memphis style - well balanced, smoky and not too sweet. Good texture too; stuck to my meat but not gooey.The baked beans...that was an odd story. My first bite was heaven. They were amazing. But I couldn't take more than 2 or 3 bites at a time before I was bored with them. It's an interesting taste, but they were almost too sock it to me and didn't have much of a 'beany' flavor. \u00a0So it was nibble something, take a bite of beans. leave them alone for a while, go back to them, have a couple of bites etc. Weird, huh?mac and cheese had a delicious buttery crumb topping, but otherwise only a bit above mediocre. What most BBQ places do is make a couple of sauces and then douse everything int he sauce: all the meats, the beans, the sausages. Great if you love the sauce! This place had very unique tastes to all the food. The brisket, ribs, pork, beans, all were unique and that is a new thing to me in the BBQ world. Unfortunately some of them missed the mark - but not by enough \u00a0not to come back. \u00a0The biggest thing is that everything is a bit too much, except the noble simple coleslaw which is simple and palate cleansing.

Amazing!! \u00a0 There aren't many businesses like Smoque anymore, where customer satisfaction is truly a #1 priority. \u00a0Barry went above and beyond to correct the mistake and helped make a customer for life!

We had their sliced beef brisket sandwich, ribs, texas sausage, peach cobbler (and order of 3 of course), and their side of fries. Again, everything was great..actually their sliced beef brisket sandwich is way better than their chopped version. The texas sausage was so good, smokey and peppery. Obviously, Tamia claimed her ribs and a side of peach cobbler. Everything was made right and nothing was soggy not even the fries when we took it home. Ah, now if only they would make bigger portion size of their peach cobbler or at least topped it with a scoop of vanilla icecream. *wishful thinking*", "Date": "2009-03-12", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Katy F.", "ReviewID": "e0vNd3YUdj0wsLddTvBPUw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is there better brisket in the city? \u00a0That is a resounding NO! \u00a0This is the best bbq I have had in Chicago. \u00a0I have been to Texas, Kansas City and all over the country eating BBQ and Smoque is the best around. \u00a0I never had better St. Louis Ribs or Brisket. \u00a0Chopped is awesome, but sliced is good to. \u00a0The Baked Beans are to die for and mac n' cheese, forget it. \u00a0I will greatly miss Smoque when we move to Denver. \u00a0Get it while you can.", "Date": "2010-05-06", "Author_Location": "Denver, CO"}, {"Author": "Adam H.", "ReviewID": "1AqfvyXd3eZ5md4uz2qejQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Smoque BBQ Survival Guide1. ParkingThe restuarant is in the middle of a neighborhood with not much around but houses so street parking seems ample with no meters. The lot directly behind Smoque is for another business during most of the day but becomes available to anyone after 5:30pm for no charge.2. Times to goI arrived at 6:30pm and there was no line. Good time to go. After 7pm a line was out the door and was still there as I was leaving around 8pm. A not so good time. During the afternoon I'm not sure for I've only eaten dinner here.3. SeatingThere are no servers but as you wait in line to order your food a nice employee will walk up to you and ask how many people you are eating with. He will then try to find a place for you and your friends to sit together amongst the bustling little seating area. This is not a great place for groups. The second time I went here I was in a group of 11 and we were split up at two different tables. Not a big deal but it will happen. Whoever you go with though expect to interact with your neighbors. The tables are close to one another and the seating area is usually full. It's kind of fun but it doesn't create a great atmosphere for long coversations or a romantic evening. If you come here you should come here to eat and little else. 4. FoodThe brisket is very tender. More so than I am used to but it is meaty and delicious and I think my favorite item on the menu. Their baby back ribs took me a second try to really like them. The main issue is that their ribs are blackened more than I've seen before and come dry with a vinager based BBQ sauce on the side. Their ribs are not the sweet, sticky, saucy, ribs I have come to expect when I order baby backs. But give them a second go at another visit or eat your left overs the next day and I bet they will grow on you. I did not try a side I didn't like. The fries were fresh cut and great. The macaroni and cheese was brilliant with a nice creaminess in the middle and a crunchiness on top. The coleslaw was a tasty vinager based one that really helped cut down all the meaty, creamy, and starchy flavors I was eating. For dessert I had the peach cobbler which was great and I don't even like peach cobbler. Food here is good and of the BBQ places I've tried in Chicago: Twin Anchors, Cooper's, Ruby's, this is hands down my favorite.5. General TipsBe ready to be stared at. Because the menu is posted on a wall right behind you as you sit and eat, the people waiting in line to order have nothing to do but read that menu, stare at your food, and watch you to see if you are leaving so they can get your seat.Don't be afraid to talk to the employees. Yes, they are busy, but I had a worker get me some ketchup, answer my questions about BBQ sauce, and take my garbage. They are there to help and seem happy to do so.If you are coming to this restaurant because of the television show, \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" don't be afraid to say you are. They fully embrace their tv fame with a huge signed poster of Guy Fieri on the wall and books to buy at the cash register.

\u00a0This is actually the worse brisket I've had. \u00a0I gave it to my cat but she wouldn't eat it. \u00a0However, if you like Smoque's brisket, know that the $3 taste portion is a generous amount. \u00a0The fries were excellent! \u00a0I haven't tried the pulled pork yet, but fear it may end up in the trash to keep the scrawny ribs company. \u00a0Sadly, Smoque was just another place in a long disappointing line that proves that Northside restaurateurs should just put away the sauce, turn off the smoker and travel a few miles to the South side to learn something about the food they are mocking with their below par efforts. \u00a0If they don't want to go to the South side, then maybe a weekend trip to Jim and Nicks in Birmingham, Dinosaur in New York, Gates in Kansas or the guy with the BBQ grill in the post office parking lot in Waterloo, Iowa may help out. \u00a0These ribs are all different, but they are all good. \u00a0Just please, I beg of you...go learn something so I can get good ribs close to home!!!Still there is one meaty reason for Smoque and their ilk to ignore my review and my advice... they have great reviews and tons of customers. \u00a0This leads me to acknowledge that there is an entirely different way of preparing BBQ ribs which a whoooooole lot of people love and appreciate...the Northside way. \u00a0To everyone who enjoys Smoque and their buddies - enjoy! \u00a0Eat it up! \u00a0Sop it up! \u00a0Love it! \u00a0I truly envy you in your bliss. \u00a0Whatever you do, do NOT go to the Southside and eat real BBQ, such as at Lem's on 75th, as you will find yourself in my position...forced to drive 18 miles for enjoyable BBQ ribs.

I think Smoque does a pretty decent job of bringing good BBQ to Chicago - in my opinion, a town that sorely needs decent BBQ. The food is always fresh and inexpensive. Over four of five trips, I have tried both styles of ribs, the brisket, and the pulled pork. I think the brisket still needs work. It lacks the deep smoke ring you see at places like Ruby's or Smokey Moe's or the Salt Lick in the Austin area. It is also a little dry. The pit masters of the Hill Country seem to be able to smoke brisket for 24 hours and have it emerge with a perfect consistency of smoke, moisture, and texture. I think if Smoque continues to work on their technique, they will eventually start getting better quality brisket. The other thing I wonder is where they're getting their brisket from? The meat is good quality but it doesn't seem to be the highest quality you might find in the BBQ meccas. Lastly, I think they add a little too much brine to the brisket, therefore detracting from the smoke.What the brisket might lack, I think the pulled pork makes up for. I really love the pulled pork here and think it is their most consistent and well-done dish. The pork is succulent and moist, with just the right amount of crust. The sauce at Smoque is excellent with the pork, with the vinegar base serving as a perfect contrast for the sweetness of the pork. The large white rolls they serve their sandwiches on are perfect for soaking up a good amounts of BBQ sauce. I've tried both styles of ribs and am leaning towards the dry rub Memphis-style ribs. Just like the brisket, I still think they need a little more smoke. But, they go extremely well with the sweet sauce they serve them with.If you go, you have to try to mac n' cheese as a side, it is delicious, with a hard crust of cheese on top that opens up to a hot, creamy interior. The beans and fries are pretty good and the slaw could use a little work. All in all, I think they do a good job and will likely get better with time. A legendary pit master in Omaha, Jerry, one of the owner's of Fojay's Pit Bar-B-Que, once told me that most smokers don't develop character until you've used them for a few years. I know I'll keep on checking out Smoque, because it is by far the best I've had in Chicago.Parking at Smoque can be a challenge and it is often crowded, but we've never had to wait for more than a few minutes for a table. The decor is basic, but I'd be worried if it were anything more for a place serving BBQ.

First Hot Doug's, and now Smoque. We arrived at ~7:40 PM on a Thursday, and the line was just barely out the door, which is always a good sign. Our food was ready before 8:10; despite the sea of humanity in this establishment, you still probably eat quicker after entry than at a sit-down BBQ restaurant.Every last morsel was divine. The pulled pork was moist yet surprisingly lean, without an atom of gristle to be found. The ribs had the telltale pink ring of meat just beneath the surface that signifies an expertly-smoked rack. The texas sausage was tender and spicy. And then there's the brisket. I apologize if you have a Jewish grandmother, because this is better than hers. It is perfectly seasoned and smoked to perfection, tender while still retaining its meatiness and shape. The side dishes (fries, corn bread, BBQ baked beans, mac and cheese, corn bread) were all delectable; it was clear that effort had been put into them, which is unusual for a barbecue place, especially a good one. Halfway through the meal I was preparing this yelp review, and realized that there was one thing that would hold Smoque away from a 5 star review: the sauce. This being a Chicago establishment, it was no surprise that the sauce was too thick and saccharine, as my fellow natives have an inexplicable penchant for cloying, barely-more-than-ketchup barbecue sauces. Still, I could not forgive this very average sauce; I wanted a sauce that packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato and a heck of a lot more heat. A fellow patron overheard my gripe, and informed me that they carried a spicy sauce in addition to the regular offering; I immediately went to the counter and picked up a sauce that (surprise) packed more vinegar punch, with less tomato, and a heck of a lot more heat. There went my lone complaint. I guess I could take off a star because the woman who took my order forgot to ask me if I wanted mild or spicy, but this meal left me in such a state of ecstasy that I'd feel like a scrooge if I did so.", "Date": "2011-08-19", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Erica I.", "ReviewID": "n3ijOZ4PMH6Nh7gZOpy91g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The mac and cheese and peach cobbler were the BEST! \u00a0I'd go back just for those.", "Date": "2011-12-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Faye B.", "ReviewID": "cH5L79ky7rFDpB-LWZH0CA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been here on numerous occasions and keep coming back.

To minimize the possibility of impulse buying, I decided to eat something before then. I was motoring east on Irving Park Rd. and decided to give this venue a shot.The word here is that five barbeque-loving guys decided to pool their resources and open a 'southern-style' B-B-Q restaurant in an under-served neighborhood. I believe most of you already know about my preference to avoid pork, which generally significantly reduces my options at B-B-Q joints. But I was able to order Smoque's chopped brisket sandwich with cole slaw and brisket chili (Wednesday's special side dish) [$8.95]. Soft drinks (Coca-Cola products) are $1.25. I was here at 3:10 pm. There was no queue out the door, and lots of seating choices inside.The brisket was good. It needed the additional B-B-Q sauce (a sweet sauce - provided) to enhance it. I also thought that it seemed to get cold around the edges of the bun. The cole slaw is the vinegar-based kind, which is not my favorite, but it was fresh, and I finished it all anyway. The brisket chili was quite good. It had a meaty flavor, even before I scooped up the shredded beef which had fallen out of my sandwich and tossed that into it. Every day, there is one custom side dish. If this is available when you visit here, you should opt for it.I am giving Smoque a four-star rating because the food is quality, its prices are average, and it successfully conveys the atmosphere of a communal dining room, which is something you infrequently glimpse in metropolitan Chicago.Transit options: This is an intermodal venue. There are many ways to get here. I'll change it up this time by telling you something significant if you decide to drive here. Because Smoque is so close to the Union Pacific Northwest line, the Irving Park Blue Line \"L\" station, and the Kennedy Expressway; but is in a residential neighborhood; there are parking restrictions on Grace St. [one way westbound], and Keystone Ave. [one way northbound] Smoque's own parking lot is only six spaces. You want to approach Smoque from the northwest; either on Irving Park Rd., or off the Kennedy at Keeler. The avenue you want to wind up on is _Avondale Ave._ It is the diagonal street on the south side of the U.P. railroad tracks. _It is one way southeastbound._ After 8:00 am, there are no parking restrictions on Avondale. Cram your vehicle into any spot you can find. Then, you'll face a one-to-two block walk. Lest you perceive I am making a fuss about this; Smoque's own pamphlet illustrates the parking situation.Lucidly, transit is overwhelmingly available. The route #53 Pulaski bus stops in front of the venue. The Irving Park Blue Line \"L\" station has an auxiliary exit at Pulaski. (A 1 1/2 block walk.) Route #80 and #X80 Irving Park buses are two blocks north. The terminus of the route #54A North Cicero bus [pm rush hours only] is three blocks northwest. Even the U.P. has a train station here {for you reverse commuters entering the city on the Metra $5.00 Weekend Pass}. But make sure you don't visit here on Monday.

Basically you have to order your food first and then the host seats you. The food is so delicious that the tables turn around fairly quickly.

We also had the beans, which were strange for us but most seem to like them. The french fries were very good and the coleslaw, which is vinegar based, was alright. I prefer more of a mayo based coleslaw. Basically you're not there for the sides, you're there for the meat and the meat rocks!

Nobody was parking there b/c the sign in huge letters says no parking, but there is an exception after 5:30 in small letters.

Hey man, what about the rub man? Well, every credible place by osmosis has some kind of rub. People that BBQ put a lot of love into what they do and I'll say it, pretty much use the same stuff. Going out on a loin, I've never had a dry rub that I didn't like. It really comes down to preference, sweet, hot, salty, mild or some kind of combination. What is your quest or shall I say, Smoque's quest for a distinct rub? Salt-n-Pepa, that wouldn't be interesting enough to market. They are heavy on the pepper and must be laying down more than a ten spot of ingredients. Beyond the Dr., the additional flavors are subtle and become indistinguishable even for the light FM dippity doer. They could reduce the amount of ingredients by half and the majority wouldn't taste the difference and please, don't give me that intentional blending of flavors between the rub and a sauce. Depending on the thickness of the meat, either the pepper or the smoke dominates over the subtleties in seeking the Holy Grail, I mean Smoque's interpretation of the perfect rub. Btw, was that an African or European swallow? The Seuss on sauces, I could find at least a dozen either vinegar, molasses or tomato based bottles in the grocery condiment aisle that you'd be going lady gaga over. They offer two, neither has a real kicker that will score a goal unless you're buying off the yelp ref. Interesting, making such a big deal about the Texas style brisket without any traditional sauce. It is closer to being pastrami than having anything to do with Texas. Remind you, this is an extremely subjective area, others will praise the sauces like some fricken fine bottle of wine. They will elaborate on how extraordinary the ordinary is. Oh, I'm sorry, one from each region, how intercontinental insensitive Sam I am. Anyway, I've labeled them thick and thin as opposed to the formally known as Thing 1 and Thing 2. The thicker adds upon the already peppery rub with its own peppy glow while the thinner doesn't stray far, however mildly masked, from tasting just like vinegar. Ironic, the thicker is hiding the vinegar with pepper and then you taste more vinegar than molasses for the thinner. \u00a0Will the real vinegar sauce please stand up? Yep, heavy on the vinegar is more of an acquired taste in this region unless for the few of you that grew up on Russell's and some, not all, will be enlightened on how well it compliments select BBQ. Certainly no HFCS in these babies, good thing since your cholesterol is already shooting off the charts and you wouldn't want to add anything else that is negative. So, you really enjoy going back to places where practically everything on the menu is well over 20% in fat, 50% plus in fanny pack calories. Thumbs up, dirty sticky finger nails and all. Certainly not a fancy highfalutin steak place that has ribs, only possibly pretentious staff and owners behind the counter placing your POS on scrap yard friendly cafeteria trays. Anyway, you can at least sit down wearing your filthy grubs instead of rushing home or gobbling it up in the car. The prices are on par with the take out places, the supposed standard when getting sincere Q. Northsider, well maybe there's one in Evanston that's barely worth avoiding the southern comfort road trip. Don't be suckered into the allure of the take out being more authentic, unless you are more into the soulful Zen of white bread and fries soaking in the sauce routine. Instead of wasting your time and depleting your gas tank, take a load off and taste a couple of Popeye sized sides with your smoked protein. BYOB, maybe you might prefer that 40 oz. bottle without the brown paper bag you've grown accustomed to. I can't object to anything that they serve. Yet, nothing that I've eaten at this place has ever wowed me. A little something of this or that in the rub or sauce is not going to give me a woody. The meat and the right amount of fat from that meat put into the smoker makes it all happen, everything else is just icing on the cake. I'd tell you straight out if the BBQ is off or bad, not here. Give a lot and I mean a lot of credit to the commercial smoker, the real secret in providing practically effortless and consistent smoked flavor that is not dried out. Imagine the possibilities if every Jewel or Dominick's had a Southern Pride. Alright, the ribs are a tad on the skinny side and I can live without their sauce. As for the pulled stuff, it demands whatever sauce that is laying around to add flavor, contrast and moisture. Brisket, bring on the heat. A hodgepodge crossbreed of this and that for such a small menu, don't get me started. W-H-A-T, a mishpocha proprietor dishing out some top notch goyish BBQ.

It got me really nervous about my order. I admitted to her that a handful of people RSVP'd to the gathering later than I had wished and she managed to bring my conservative $350 order up to nearly $600. It was really more than I could spend but she said this, \"So are you only trying to feed your guests just a taste because if this was my party, I'd order a lot more than what you're ordering.\" That statement really made me nervous... I told her a lot of the guests were not big eaters... I also have catering experience having planned conferences for a living professionally... well, I should have gone with my gut.The food arrived, by one of the most helpful guys ever. The food tasted and looked great (the guests loved it) but I can't tell you how much food was wasted. We had two and half extra pans of pulled pork that went uneaten. We had three bags of buns that were never opened. And we had one extra container of slaw. I'd say, about $150 worth of extra food that didn't need to be there.

(To be fair, I love me some Neely's, some Fat Willy's and Memphis BBQ in general; not a huge fan of BBQ from the southeast...unless it is REALLY special).Bad night on the logistical front (computer/register down) so I will not hold that against them. Bus service kept pushing past me to go back and forth (this happens when the line runs thru the center of the room and there is only one set of trash cans...so that was a bit aggravating).I love BBQ...I'm not what you might call an aficionado, but I have eaten a LOT of it in a great many places. I will start with the positive...I have never had better quality in terms of cooking/texture/preparations. 5-star performance on that front.What I will hold against them is their utter inability to BBQ some meat! I had St. Louis and Baby Back ribs; both bland meat. Rub nothing special (too much of something...clove?) on taste but created a nice (carmelized?) crust. Wife had the chicken; exact same opinion. \u00a0Mac & cheese could not have set better in the mouth; if only it had tasted as good as it felt. \u00a0Slaw vinegar-y, sauce vinegar-y, cornbread an utter diappointment (and I do consider myself a bit of a cornbread expert). \u00a0Baked beans...yep, you guessed it...vinegar-y. Onions cooked to a beautiful texture and translucence, but apparently added to the beans because they certainly did nothing to help the flavor; beans were not tender enough. Sauce and everything was beautiful to look at; and I am sure a quite-qualified individual established the recipes/operations. But this is a case of a restauranteur trying to BBQ and not of a BBQ man trying to run a restaurant. I classed it as \"white men can't BBQ,\" no SOUL in this comfort food.The peach cobbler was in a different league altogether, however. My wife is a big cobbler person, and she was ga-ga. I thought the crust, while not your typical cobbler crust, was better than anything I have ever put in my mouth as part of a cobbler, and the peach stuff tasted like fresh peaches (a little tart, not too mushy); cannot ask for much more in this arena (unless it would be to make it cherry cobbler - if they had cherry cobbler to compare to the peach, I would move in...).Overall, a disappointment. I waited for years to get \u00a0in there and am pretty well aggravated that I did not instead go to my stand-by, Fat Willy's.

The line looked like it was moving quickly; I'd guess people were waiting about 20 minutes to order at 7pm on a Friday, and there were a few tables open for people to sit down. The cafeteria-style seating looked serviceable, but Smoque clearly isn't a destination for its atmosphere.I sampled the pulled pork, links, and brisket. They were out of St. Louis-style ribs. A sign over the register indicated that they had been having quality control issues. The pulled pork was excellent. Not as juicy as I would've liked, but very good nonetheless, with a deep, flavorful bark. The meat was slightly sweet, with a good amount of smoke. Not the best pulled pork I've had in the city, but definitely up there.I usually shy away from BBQ beef in Chicago; we're a pork town. However, the links and brisket were both outstanding. Honestly, the first BBQ beef I've had in Chicago that I would order again.The links had a great snap to the casing, with a spicy, peppery, floral top-note over the sweet beef. Just outstanding quality meat, very juicy. The brisket was the first I've had outside of Austin that I enjoyed. Very, very tender and juicy, with a healthy amount of smoke throughout. Not too fatty, but not nearly as mealy as some of the leaner briskets I've had before. Great bark, as well.The only real let-down was the sauce. A cloying, citrusy mess. Like a mix between OJ concentrate and molasses. The meat was good enough that I enjoyed all of it without sauce, but I was surprised by the sauce. Seemed like they were trying to do something unique instead of just making a quality complement to the meat.Summary: Not my favorite BBQ joint in the city (around 71st Street is still the standard), but definitely one of the better options out there.

After waiting about 30 minutes being jostled and pushed by people cutting the line for various reasons (usually they would get a \"line holder\" then the rest of the party would try to push their way to the front through a narrow passage).Once we got to the front a guy ask us how many were in our party so he could find us a table, we ordered and paid (they only had one register open on a Friday Night with the line going out the door) then were taken to a table.

And I love bbq. My fiance hit this dive up yesterday around 7ish pm & there was a small line one the door, but it moved pretty quickly. The place is pretty snug & is like a cafeteria style with the arrangement. It really looks like a dive.The smell was driving me insane, it smelled amazing. I scanned the menu quickly & decided upon a chopped brisket sandiwch & a half slab of st. louis ribs, my fiance (who didn't know the sandwich was going to be an acutal whole sandwich) did the half and half w/sliced brisket sandwich & pulled pork. We ordered for the sides, 2 drinks, a large macaroni and cheese, a large fry, and a large cole slaw. Total price: $46 dollars. We got seated by one the guys. It was packed inside. \u00a0We didn't wait too long for the food which was a good thing. I quickly poured the sauce over the brisket sandwich and took a bite. The brisket itself was alright, I didn't get too much flavor from it, which I was surpised because I thought the guy put like a million spices on it. I did not like the sauce at all. I know this is because I am more partial to sweet sauces more than vinegar based ones. The fries were out of this world I loved them, I think my fiance only had a handful and I had the paperbag (which by the way is a great idea because the bag soaks up the grease). The macaroni and cheese was cheesy and I love the crust on top, it just needed a little bit more salt though. The cole slaw was deliciously tangy and refreshing. The ribs were amazingly juicy, tender, full of flavor, and literally fell off the bone. Pulled pork was alright, wish it had a better kick to it and the Texas sausauge tasted like a polish sausage! The drive for us and the price was not worth it for us unfortunately. in addition, the bus boys made me feel very rushed, they kept eyeing us and asking about taking our trays, it pissed me off & made me uncomfortable, it's not my damn fault the place is small & there's a big line, WTF you want me to do!!!

While the seating arrangement was a little too cozy for my taste, they are very nice and have an efficient process of getting you seated when eating in. Didn't want to spend more than $10 so I went with the pulled pork sandwich. The pork literally melts in your mouth. The coleslaw is obviously homemade and very tasty, so I slapped some on the sandwich. As far as the meat itself, these guys know their stuff. As far as the sauce, it 's vinegar based and thin, not really my style. Don't get me wrong it was good, but it didn't exactly have my taste buds dancing. Ever since tasting Sandy's sauce at Hog Wild, nothing compares. The fresh cut fries are good, salty, and plentiful. My main beef with this place is that if you want to have anything rib -like, it'll hit you up for close to $20.

They made 2 styles of ribs 1 of which I thought was great and the other I didn't care for. The brisket I didn't care for either.

I went with a Texan and we both agreed the best thing we had was the sixpack of beer we brought in. He tried the brisket and I had the pulled pork... The pork was dry and flavorless. I tried their \"BBQ sauce\"... Well I actually mean their taco bell sauce. Seriously it really tastes like Taco Bell sauce. The owner could see I didn't like the sauce and brought me two other sauces. Still no better. Really runny and really bad flavor. The corn bread was dry and flavorless. The cole slaw was vinegary and soggy, but not a good soggy. The actual best part of the food we had was the BBQ beans. Was the only thing I cared to finish... All in all a bust.

The mac and cheese was loose, creamy and topped with a little bit of breadcrumbs. The beans were a balance of sweet and tangy, and the slaw was fresh and nice and vinegary-sweet. Their Memphis BBQ sauce was outstanding and I ordered a chopped beef-brisket sandwich to go, which lasted a few miles before I pulled over into a parking lot to devour it.
