Although I would recommend to make a reservation (especially for dinner during the weekend), you will be amazed by the food you'll get. The prices are a bit high for tapas but it is worth the money. We ordered a selection of 6 tapas and I definitely recommend to get the French onion Soup Dumplings and the Potato and Goat cheese Pierogies that were just amazing. The menu is so long that you want to order anything but also make you want to come back to try them all. The portions were large enough to share with 4 people and the service was good. On top of it, the music was not as loud as I was expecting after reading some reviews and we could actually talk to each other without screaming.

I would suggest arriving on time for this place (especially on a Saturday night). From what I can tell you would still have to wait, just not quite as long. Also, your entire party has to be there to be seated. Once seated, both the service and the food were amazing! \u00a0The food is all served family style, and if you have more people than each order comes with, you can add extra serving a la carte on many of the dishes. The french onion dumplings were so good! They are served in little trays usually reserved for escargot, and I could eat more right this second! Also something that stood out was the shrimp and grits. They are individual with two shrimp and a grit patty underneath. Definitely a treat. while the atmosphere of this place is charming it is also fairly loud. We sat upstairs so had a DJ blasting music the entire time and downstairs seemed just as boisterous. \u00a0Regardless of the wait and the loudness, I had a great time and look forward to returning to this place for round two.

We were seated promptly and at a good table. \u00a0When the waitress arrived I wanted to order only two items to start so as to pace the meal. \u00a0She specifically stated that we should order everything at once because their chefs would absolutely parse it out. \u00a0No sooner did we order than two plates arrived, followed immediately by two more. \u00a0We had four plates taking up the whole table after I especially asked not to be rushed. \u00a0Then the last two entrees arrived. \u00a0We ordered wine and drinks, as well as dessert. \u00a0While I was eating desert, literally a spoon in my mouth, a manager came by and dropped the check \u00a0on the table. Hadn't asked for it and hadn't even been asked by the waitress if we wanted anything further. Check was practically flung on the table. Upon paying the bill i wrote a comment on the card about the service/experience. \u00a0To their credit, a manager came over to discuss. \u00a0While he apologized, it didn't particularly seem sincere - especially given that when he offered to buy us a drink to end the evening on a positive note, he did not want us taking the table any longer and asked to buy us a drink in the ridiculously crowded (read fire marshall capacity), standing room only, bar upstairs. \u00a0I've been to a lot of restaurants in NYC and on a friday night no less. \u00a0I have never been as rushed as I was at Stanton. \u00a0It obvious how badly they were trying to turn over guests. \u00a0The table of two sitting next to us had paid their bill and were having a quiet chat whilel finishing their wine. \u00a0The manager came up to them and \"encouraged\" them to leave as well by inquiring what further he could do for them.

The minute we stepped inside, the place was bumpin'. It was a flurry of activity with people gabbing away at their tables and music pumpin' through the three floor space. Luckily for me, we were seated on the third floor which is a lot quieter, which suited me much better. The space definitely has a vibe and a life to it that you are not gonna get at home.To start, we ordered some Red Snapper Tacos and the Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas. They are known for the Red Snapper Tacos, and while they were good, I prefered the chicken arepas myself, which is why we ordered another round of those later. The dice on the vegetable and fruit on the red snapper tacos was so tiny and a real treat. I thought it brought a nice textural element, but the texture of the hand pulled chicken was out of control good. That little pile of chicken just melted in my mouth.We also tried another dish they are known for, the French Onion Soup Dumplings. I must agree with a previous reviewers when they said that they taste better than they smell. The smell is definitely a little off putting... must be the cheese. Though they are tasty. They weren't my favourite thing there, but they were definitely the most unique and creative.For our main we had the Fried Chicken and Maple Cheddar Waffles with louisana hot sauce butter. Because this was a main and a little more money it was a bigger bite, and you got four servings instead of three like some of the others. So don't be oftput by the price differences as you will get more bang for your buck. I thought putting the maple inside the waffle instead of syrup was a smart idea. And they were so delicious when you wiped some of that hot sauce butter on it.My favourite part of the meal though, and the best dessert I had in New York, and one of my favourites ever was the S'mores Creme Brulee. I haven't been so surprised by a plate of food in a long time. The creme brulee was cold which was surprise #1. Surprise #2 was the liquid bitter espresso like chocolate underneath. The sweetness came from the marshmellow, but the bitter came from this, and they mixed perfectly. And the textures were quite different with the marshmellow, and the liquid chocolate and the creme brulee.

I've been looking for you for some time now. If you know anything about me, you know that I'm a sucker for a good cooking competition show. Food Network, Bravo, you name it, I'm probably watching it. So when I see Chris Santos as the judge on Chopped and they talk about his restaurant on the Lower East Side, you know that I've had it bookmarked for a while.Finally, we should up last night to see what all the hype was about. I made a reservation through opentable a few weeks before as this was the destination I had picked for my fianc\u00e9s birthday dinner. We were seated right away and there seemed to be 3 men who were upper management walking along the restaurant checking in on everything constantly. Nice touch. Our waiter was very nice. We didn't see much of him as the bussers brought over our food but when he did check in he was cordial and went over the menu with us and told us about some highlights. He insisted we order the potato and goat cheese pierogis and the French onion soup dumplings. Obviously I've been scoping out the menu for quite some time so of course those were at the top of my list. Here is what we ordered: 3 oysters: 2 west coast and one east coast. My fianc\u00e9 loved them. They came with 5 accompaniments. His favorite was the marinated orange segments. Potato and goat cheese pierogis with truffled cr\u00e8me fraiche: Oh my god. Fried perfectly and the cr\u00e8me fraiche was incredible. The cracked black pepper on top was a great touch and those caramelized onions were heavenly. French onion soup dumplings: Holy crap. Excuse my profanity but holy living crap. These were PERFECTION. The French onion soup was so rich and tasted heavily of wine and the cheese was crispy and melted. The bread-vessel was delicious and I just loved them so much. If there are 4 people definitely order two orders. 3 for myself made me happy. Shrimp and \"grits\": What an incredible dish. For $22 you get 6 perfectly cooked shrimp over 3 delicious cheesy grit cakes with the most amazing creole sauce I've ever had. The shrimp were so tender it was like cutting into a scallop. I was obsessed with the little grit cake. Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Delicious. Big sexy burger: One of the best burgers I've ever had. Gooey cheese, perfectly cooked patties, delicious sauce, crazy good caramelized onion, on a soft roll. Served with BACON AND BLUE CHEESE FRIES. Need I say more? Brussels sprouts: Acidic sauce that made them sweet with pancetta that made them savory and crispy leaves with grated parmesan. I don't think I'd order these again but my fianc\u00e9 loved them.Red velvet Twinkie: I kind of regret ordering this instead of the suggested donuts. I saw pictures of this Twinkie and knew I had to have it but it was very dry. Between the two of us we barely got through half of one. I'm glad we only ordered one. Spiked milk shake shot: Tasty! You could definitely taste the bourbon. Fun end to the meal. Only negative was the food was spaced out at weird times. We'd get two dishes and wait like 20 minutes for the next few dishes to come after they cleared our plates.

At first impression, seemed like a cool, fun, trendy place with bumpin music. We arrived ~10 minutes prior to our reservation so we were told to wait at the bar upstairs and the hostess would come get us. Took them almost 45 minutes for them to get us seated, which I was quite disappointed about - what's the point of making a reservation if you can't get seated on time or at least near the time of the reservation. It also seemed as if the hostesses would pay more attention to the douchey guys trying to flirt with them who came in after us - who we saw get seated before us! At that point - after already waiting for my table for 45 minutes, I don't care who you are, you can wait to be seated.Once we sat down, the service was very good and fast. Our waiter suggested some of the small plates from the menu and we went with most of the suggestions. The food quality was pretty good, but have had better tapa style food elsewhere. I felt as if most of the items we ordered were ordinary, nothing spectacular that would make me go back for that one particular item.We had the french onion dumplings (very good - prob the only outstanding item we had), meatballs (good, but pretty regular), red snapper tacos (pretty good, but seemed as if they were pre-prepped and not fresh), \u00a0goat cheese pierogies (pretty good). For dessert we had the mini s'mores shots which were quite delicious but nothing \"different\" compared to what I've had before.Overall, pretty decent place if you're looking to bring someone to look cool in front of but in terms of having top notch small plates/tapas cuisine, this ain't it.", "Date": "2014-05-13", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Heather S.", "ReviewID": "9WQn3FrosTljyvOQoKrEcA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know if we loved Stanton Social because we had no expectations of the place before we went but it was really great. \u00a0I didn't know what to expect food wise or atmosphere wise but I would highly recommend this place.

Make a reservation a this place for a Friday nightB.) Be surprised that my table wasn't ready at said reservation time (that it would be at least 30 minutes before we'd be seated) C.) That there would be a place for my party and I to stand while we waited for our table to be ready (besides out in the rain)And D.) Expect that the service would be professional and friendlySo here's how it actually went down. A friend from out of town was visiting and we decided at 3pm on a Friday that we wanted to go somewhere good for dinner with another friend. This dinner was doomed from the beginning (and maybe this is another thing I should have known), as it was just too good to be true that there were a ton of reservations available for this place on open table. I had dined here before and the food (while a bit overhyped) was good and had lots of variety (good for our mixed group of carnivores and vegetarians) and was super surprised but very happy to snag one for 9:30 for the three of us. So, I arrive at the restaurant first and it was an absolute madhouse. The whole place was squished with people like an over-packed club. I shrug it off, it's a Friday, maybe these people are just here for drinks so I wait in line to let the hostess know that I was there. Super icy vibe from her from the beginning. Instead on making a note that I was there she tells me to come back when my party is all here. Fine. I know the drill, everyone needs to be there to be seated. She's way nicer to the dude next to me who is early with his party of 11 for their 945 seating. Maybe she knew him? She doesn't ask if his party is all there.My friends arrive two minutes later.I go back in to tell the hostess that we were all there she looks at me and says \"name? Reservation time?\" Like we hadn't spoke literally two minutes ago. Fine. Whatever. I tell her again and she says \"ok you can go have a drink up at the bar, it'll be 15-20 minutes\".So, we try to go to the bar upstairs which is literally SO packed I bet the fire department would have shut it down if they saw how many people were in there. It was crazy. We couldn't get near the bar. Instead we go back outside to wait but it's raining and, at this point I start to feel pretty terrible that this was the place I made a reservation for my friend for her Friday night in New York. At 9:45 we decide that if our table isn't in the process of being cleared, we'll find somewhere else in the area to go and start looking for alternativesSo at 9:50, I go back to the hostess and ask how much longer it will be. Again she pretends like she didn't \u00a0remember me and proceeds to tell me that the table has the check but there's no way she can know how long it's going to be. Yea, I've played this game before. That's codeword for at least another 15-20 minutes (Btw forgot to mention that the dude with the reservation for 11 was seated 5 minutes after he got in) and there wasn't even a hint of an apologetic tone in her voice. So I say thanks but there's no place for us to wait and it's raining outside so we're going to go somewhere else and start to leave. The lady actually tries to argue with me about me leaving!! She starts telling me that I only told her 10 minutes ago that I was there (false) and that we can wait inside if we want to (false) and just won't let it goI'm sorry but that's ridiculous. I get it that these restaurants build in a buffer for people to drink at the bar before there meal but if that is not possible, I'm facing a 30 minute wait for my reservation AND there's no place for me and my party to stand expect in the rain why on earth would you argue with me about my deciding to go somewhere else where my party and I can actually eat/drink???? How could you be anything but apologetic about the fact that you cannot honor my reservation in the first place??? SO unprofessional.we finally left went to a casa fox down the street and were treated like actual human beings and had a great dinner.So yea TLTR: this place is way over hyped, unprofessional and super scene-y. They also don't honor reservations and fully expect you to wait without apology. The food is good (from my prior experiences there) but not good enough to have to deal with their crappy attitude.

There were mushrooms and carrots, fish and chips, a taquito, oysters, some other things I can't remember...the beauty of a tapas place is that there is a lot to order and eat, without being ridiculously full. The drink menu is creative (albeit a bit complicated for my simple tastes), and everything comes out in a progressive fashion that is not rushed, nor overwhelming.

However, it wasn't until we sat down that we were told the menu was small plates and that a table of four (us) should order 9-11 plates. Uh... what? I've never had to order ELEVEN small plates to feed four people. But we did as we were told and got ten plates, because service was really slow and the restaurant was full and we didn't want to have to wait forever we decided we wanted more.

Like none. And it was a hot mess. French Onion Soup Dumplings $12- Just... no. They were difficult to get out their little pots, they were extremely potent (think of the smell of rotten onions) and they were quite soggy. If you have a texture thing, this dish is not for you.Red Snapper Tacos -creamy avocado, spicy mango $10- The fish genuinely smelled spoiled. I couldn't eat half of my taco.

But overall review, I take off a few for icy hostess and ridiculously loud obnoxious music. We were a party of 8 on Saturday evening. Half our party was late for the reservation and half sent up to the bar. When the late party arrived we weren't seated until our friends came down from the bar, the hostess was adamant we all had to be present to be seated. Okay, I get it, I do. But they were squaring a check and on their way down. And we were staring at our set table that obviously was for us (the place is pretty small) and we couldn't sit down why? It just seemed weird. So when our friends finally came down the hostess then asked us if we would be finished dinner by 7:45, presumably because that's when that table was next reserved. Ummmm, I guess it depends how fast your kitchen cooks the food--wth kind of question is that? Like you're not sending that party up to the bar first?? I mean, just weird. Thankfully when we were seated we had a very friendly waitress. She also recommended a number of dishes based on the number of people at our table and at first this sounded like a lot but once you get rolling (and eating) everything is delicious and you'll gladly order more. Everything we had was delicious--everything. No low notes here. Even the boring sounding spinach salad was to die for. Drinks were STRONG! Very nice, especially for what they cost. Most of us were too full for dessert but we had the donuts and they were good but the red velvet \"twinkie\" was a bit of a disappointment. Otherwise the food was good and we would go back based on food (and drinks!) alone. The music is crazy loud. Why do trendy places insist on loud music? If I want to go to the club I'll go after dinner. I mean, seriously? You can barely hear the person next to you. One woman in our group barely talked, she didn't even bother, till we hit a bar later.

So instead we went with just 5 main dishes and saved room for dessertsRed Snapper Taco - I was expecting red snapper sashimi/poke in these tacos. Nevertheless, loved the combo of guac, mango, spicy mayo. Very similar to the tacos we got in Zengo. French onion soup dumplings - their signature dish - each order came with 6 in a escargot plate- delicious but wished the cheese was melted - it was somewhat lukewarm by the time it was served.Beef Wellington - the puff pastry was buttery and rich, the filet mignon + foie gras mousse however - lack of seasoning and no sign of the mousse. \u00a0Salmon - This was my favorite dish - I loved the pesto, sriracha crust - lots of unique flavor + texture, along with the cold soba noodle salad - was very refreshing. Surprised this wasn't a more popular dish. I really wished we had just ordered 5 of this dish.Scallop - my fav seafood on a bed of creamy risotto - can never go wrong.

Overall, not the most pleasant experience. One of our starters were snapper tacos that had a drop of a sauce on the side. I wanted to deep my taco into this sauce to have a full experience of the dish the way it was served, but as soon as we picked up tacos from the main serving plate, the stuff just grabbed this plate because I assume they thought we were finished with it. There was another little dish on our table I wasn't finished with and the stuff came to us 4 times asking, \"Are finished?\" I was still chewing my food when they came up and it bothered me because I was thinking to myself why would they ask me that if I was still chewing my food and my mouth was full to even respond? I couldn't relax and enjoy because I had to constantly protect the plates from being cleaned off the table too fast. When you spend roughly $80-$100 per person, the last thing you want is to be rushed. The food was good, but not amazing. I would give 5 stars on the presentation and 4 stars on the flavors and quality. We shared 5 dishes among 2 people + a desert and everything was so rich and heavy that we had a hard time digesting it after.

The concept itself is worth ordering.- Tuna poke wontons. These were presented in mini fried taco shells but the tuna was absolutely amazing. I don't think I've had tastier marinated raw tuna anywhere. - Sriracha and pea-crusted salmon. Very light and the beet and cold salad pairing was refreshing.- Spaghettini carbonara. So cute! Little individual mounds of spaghetti topped with pork belly and a quail egg. Absolutely delicious.Just OK:- Crabcake corn dogs. Awesome to try because I love crab cakes (yay Maryland) and corn dogs separately but these weren't mind blowing.- Beef Wellington. My first time trying anything with foie gras and I just don't think it was meant for me :/ the beef was cooked perfectly though. As for dessert, definitely get the bourbon hot chocolate shooters. We heard great things about the donuts but opted for salted caramel mousse with popcorn (!!) flavored ice cream.

It's a really nice place for birthdays, date nights and even an engagement. A guy proposed to his girlfriend and the whole restaurant cheered him on! Woohoo! One thing that I noticed during the night was that the person at the next table was literally sitting 5 inches next to me. You don't really get privacy and you basically know everyone's business (Didn't really bother me much, but I know it might be annoying for others). However, it's a small place so I get that they're trying to pack as many table in as possible. The upstair lounge area was a lot less crowded and quieter. I suggest you head up there if you're only going for a drinks. Now on to the food:1) We started off with some cocktails and wine. I ordered a Selbach German Riesling (which was delicious) and he ordered the Summer Centennial (and they did not cheap out on the whiskey). 2) We had complimentary celery root soup. I'm not a fan of celery, so it was a bit off for me. 3) Red Snapper Tacos were amazing! They sprinkled avocado and mango salsa on top. Just FYI: The next table told us that the Braised Short Rib Soft Tacos was not a very good option. (Like I mentioned, everyone knew each other's business...haha)4) Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies were DELICIOUS! The truffle creme fraiche really made my day! It had a cool and refreshing taste to it. I wanted to dip that sauce in everything. 5) Butternut Squash Ravioli was probably the best dish of the night. The butternut squash puree had so much flavor to it. 6) Kobe Beef Burger was cooked medium rare was very juicy and tender. But for $8 for a single mini burger was ridiculously priced. 7) Same goes for the Rhode Island Lobster Roll was $10 for a little roll. Although it was delicious, I could have gone to Luke's Lobster and gotten a gigantic roll (with 4x the lobster meat) for $15. 8) Spaghettini Carbonara was okay. The pork belly was very crispy and flavorful and the quail egg was really adorable on the dish. However, pasta is just pasta at the end of the day. They were sticking to each other like glue. I think if they used spaghetti squash it would have been more unique.9) Chicken n' Waffles was decent. The waffle was made with a thick and heavily dense dough. It was fluffy and I wanted a lighter batch, but that's all based on preference. Parts of the chicken was dry and bland and the other part was salty. 10) Cider & Bourbon Heritage: This was probably my least favorite dish. I felt like the sauce overpowered the taste of the spare ribs. Last but not least, DESSERTS! I had asked the waiter if he could put a little candle on our dessert since it was a birthday surprise. As he was taking our order for dessert, I looked up to stare at him (as a reminder for the candle) and he just winked back at me letting me know everything was taken care of (cutest waiter ever!!!!!). 11) Milk Chocolate Salted Caramel Mousse was not bad. It felt more like a chocolate sandwich, but the salted caramel popcorn they used were delicious. I would have been satisfied with the popcorn itself. Everyone else was ordering the Warm Doughnuts and that looked AWESOME! 12) Our lovely waiter sent the birthday boy a chocolate cupcake with a little candle (just like I asked for) and that just ended our night beautifully! I was happy with the result. **Just a note: Overall, the dinner was amazing and I wouldn't have changed it one bit. However, just a note, I came here a month ago to make reservations and this asian hostess gave me the nastiest attitude when making reservations. Also, you have to make reservations in advance. I originally wanted a dinner reservations for 2 at 7pm on Thursday, Dec 19 and they were all full and only had a 10:30pm opening (and this was a month in advance. I didn't think thursday was such a hot night).", "Date": "2013-12-22", "Author_Location": "Fresh Meadows, NY"}, {"Author": "Krista J.", "ReviewID": "7RSC1OqvOQo15kCTuJhYvg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My expectations for The Stanton Social were both high and low...the legend of this restaurant, and the outstanding Yelp reviews got me really excited for my book club holiday party. But at the same time, how can a restaurant really live up to all this hype, years after opening?Well, The Stanton Social exceeded even my highest expectations! Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I knew that the space overall would be pretty small and that we'd be sitting pretty much on top of each other, as well as our neighboring tables. This was indeed the case...we were packed in like sardines, but somehow it was OK. The two story high ceilings really open up the space, and the low lighting and banquet tables make things feel intimate. Though a few from our group of seven had been to the restaurant before, a couple of us, myself included, were newbies. So the waitress took us through the menu and explained how everything is small plates. She also said that though some dishes come with just 4 or 5 items, she could make sure that we got 7 of each thing so we could all taste every dish. What a brilliant policy!We started with some yummy cocktails...I loved the Strawberry Fields ($13) cocktail of Grey Goose Citron and strawberries. Then we dove into the menu ordering the following:--French Onion Soup Dumplings (AMAZING!)--Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies --Old School Meatballs --Butternut Squash Ravioli--Chicken and Waffles (my fave of the night)--Crabcake Corn Dogs--Mac & Cheese with Chorizo--Tuna Poke Wonton TacosEverything was delicious, unique and fun! The whole meal was well-paced, since the dishes are served as they become available. I absolutely loved the French Onion Soup Dumplings and the Chicken and Waffles. And I had three helpings of the Mac & Cheese. After dinner, we did our gift exchange and samples the Warm Donuts with Dipping Sauces (chocolate, caramel, strawberry). So good!And if you can believe it...our bill came to just $60 a person...this is a great place for a group of fun people who like good food, good drinks and good conversation!

Rhode Island Lobster Roll- I like lobster, so I was curious what this would this was like. It was okay, maybe above average tasting Lobster Roll. 7. Cider & Bourbon Heritage Baby Back Ribs- my friend said it was burnt, but it tasted alright. Not crazy about this dish. 8. Chicken and Waffles- brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle,corn pudding, balsamic spiked maple syrup. The Chicken tasted good, but the waffle was definitely the best part of this dish. 9.

Spaghettini Carbonara- braised pork belly, sunny-side up quail egg. Not bad. If they could have done something with the spaghetti or use something else, it probably would have tasted better.

However, dining at The Stanton Social is absolutely a memorable experience and is a great choice if you want to do something a little different.

So definitely something to keep in mind when choosing your weekend dinner location.I was pleasantly surprised by the portions of the dishes since SS markets itself as a \"tapas\" restaurant. There are tons of options on the menu -- too many, in my opinion, as it's clear this place has no discernible expertise or focus...but my friends loved the variety so guess you just have to know your audience beforehand. We shared the below offerings (with ros\u00e9 in hand) over the course of the evening:- 2 orders of goat cheese pirogues- 2 orders of french onion soup dumplings - lobster roll- crab cake corn dogs- 2 orders of herbed fries- pulled chicken open-faced arepas- mac and cheeseAll dishes were satisfying (and all were heart-stoppingly caloric), and the service was fine once we were seated. My final complaint is that the music was playing at such a death defying decibel that we found ourselves shouting at each other like old folks at a bingo tournament. I'm usually a huge proponent of bumping the mealtime jams, but this was too much. Also I think I heard some Flo Rida.

We had the French onion soup dumplings (a must get), red snapper tacos, social Mac and cheese, Kobe beef sliders, ribs which were really tender and easily fell off the bones, crab cakes, and mini doughnuts.Overall experience: I would come back for the food but not if this type of service continues.

The best I had was the Pork belly tacos and the carbonara spagettini which has pork belly with crispy skin on top of noodels and small raw egg on top. This was probably the best I had. My favorite too. The rest of the dishes were okay like the chicken and waffles, pea crusted salmon and crab cake corn dogs. We also ordered red velvet twinkies which was very dry and the cream cheese icing was super salty. \u00a0My friend said the donuts were good and worth ordering.I gave this place a 1 star because I think our server = who was the super tall white guy with shaggy straight hair ( Friday night, Feb 28th shift)was playing favoritism and a RACIST.. First of all he suggested for us to get 5 dishes to try which I think was too much because I barely ate my share of the chicken waffles and the salmon. I sincerely thintk that he TOOK ADVANTAGE of us once he found out it was our first time here. \u00a0He barely checked up on us on how we were doing and if our dishes tasted good. And I think he was playing favoritism. There were two ladies next to us who did not order drinks and ordered only 2 dishes and 2 desserts which he only charged them for one because I overheard him say that if you don't like the first dessert I give you, just take one bite and if you don't like it, I will take it off your tab and give you a different dessert. WELL, we didnt like the red velvet twinkies and he didn't even bother to ask us if we liked it or not. He just charged us anyway. Is this because we were ASIANS and the two laides next to us where WHITE??? This is completey unfair. I didnt say anything at that time, because I did not want my experience here to ruin my beautiful Friday night.Chris Santos, if you're reading this, please take care of this.

The mini muffins were not too sweet, perfect little pumpkiny bites, with a tender crumb. \u00a0I didn't try any of the lobster dishes, not because I didn't want to, but because I was actually eating with other people and trying to restrain myself.

It's incredible smooth and just fabulous. We were considering ordering a second round of this!2. Chicken arepas: 3.75/5: Pretty good. A good heap of shredded chicken that was flavorful but not out of this world good. 3. Crab Cake Corn Dogs: 2/5: Disappointment! There was so much potential here, but unfortunately, it tasted mostly like the corn cake and not much crab. definitely could pass on this. 4. Lamb soulvakis: 4.25/5: Surprisingly good! Didn't think it would be as good as it was. Almost like a taco with a good amount of meat that's nicely flavored and spiced. I would definitely recommend this, especially if you like lamb!5. Ahi Tuna Poke: 4/5: This was really good. Chopped up pieces of ahi tuna on a crispy wonton. Would def get this again. 6. Popcorn Shrimp: 3/5: You get a good amount of shrimp, but unfortunately, they were a tad salty on the outside. Otherwise, they were very crispy. I would have preferred a spicier dipping sauce, though. 7. Chicken n Waffles: 1/5: YES YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY! 1/5! THIS WAS THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE NIGHT. The chicken wasn't fried. And it was almost crunchy in a way you don't want chicken to be because its borderline raw. And the waffle was totally soggy and didn't have any flavor. The sauce was also equally depressing. do not get this!!!!8. Herbed Fries: 4/5: but then again, can you really mess up fried potatoes? I would suggest getting this earlier in the night, though.9. baked spanikopita: 3/5: i could've passed on this dish, but maybe its because i am not the biggest spanikopita fan. I thought it lacked salt, but it may have been because the shrimp I was also eating at the time were too salty. 10. Doughnuts: 4/5: We were so stuffed but still managed to sneak in room for dessert. They're fluffy and light and made for the perfect ending to our meal. I'm a huge chocolate fan, but thought the caramal dipping sauce was the best. Overall, we all had \u00a0great impression of this place. We ordered 5-6 drinks and paid roughly $65/person. Definitely on the pricier side, however, it was nice place to celebrate something special!

We ended up ordering 12 dishes and boy were we stuffed!French Onion Soup Dumplings - I was excited to try this out since everyone recommended it on \u00a0yelp but when I had it, it wasn't what I expected. It was too salty and I did not enjoy it one bit.Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogi - DISGUSTING! Again, I ordered this because of the rave on yelp and because our waitress told us it was one of their most popular dishes. I'm sorry but I couldn't take a second bite of this. I took one bite of this and had to rinse my mouth with water/cocktail and the taste of the goat cheese was still there. So if you're not a fan of goat cheese, do not order this! :(Chicken & Waffles - Comes in an order of 4 or 8. I didn't get to try this out because i was too stuffed by the time it came. I'm assuming it was good because it was gone in 2 minutes! Red Snapper Tacos - I liked this but couldn't really taste the fish.Spinach & Corn Salad - I liked this very much. Their dressing was delicious and that bit of spiciness to it definitely helped. Kobe Sliders & Lobster Slider - I liked the kobe slider, it was cooked very nicely and my friends enjoyed it as well. As for the lobster roll, I did not like it one bit. The lobster were \u00a0under dressed and it was bland. Popcorn Shrimp - Shrimp was cripsy and delicious. The spicy mayo dipping sauce was delicious as well. Mac & Cheese - YUMMY! We finished the whole dish within 5 minutes and this was when we were so full that our belles are about to pop!Ribs - Comes in an order of 5-6 Ribs. The meat was tender and the flavor was good. We couldn't finish it though because we were stuffed so we took the rest to go.Meatballs - HUGE meatballs on top of ravioli. The flavor of the meatballs were delicious and paired well with the ravioli.

I've been on a dumpling kick lately (Buddakan, Huong Viet and Veselka (counting pierogies as a form of \u00a0dumpling), and The Stanton Social fits right in with that theme. They are known for their French Onion Soup Dumplings. I first heard about these on The Best Thing I Ever Ate. Like Claire Robinson says in the video, this appetizer \"rocks the appetizer WORLD\". With each bite, you get the crispy texture of the dumpling, filled with french onion soup made with four types of onions caramelized in butter, red wine, chicken and beef broth that simmers for hours, that is then topped and baked with nutty gruyere cheese and a garlic crouton. B A M. The Kobe Beef Burger, Grilled Cheddar Jalape\u00f1o and Bacon Slider, and Eggplant Parmesan are among a few of my favorite dishes here. They also offer a mouth-watering, bangin' looking brunch and lots of cocktail and wine choices. No matter what, save room for dessert. The Warm Doughnuts served with caramel, chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces are delish. Not quite as good as the one's at Flex Mussels, but still awesome. And if doughnuts aren't your thing, their entire Dessert menu looks incredible from the S'Mores Creme Brulee... to the Blueberry Olive Oil Cake... to the Mocha Sundae with coffee ice cream, brownies and espresso meringue.

I understand restaurants want to fill their seats as often as possible, but there are more gracious ways to go about it, and this was downright rude. And we hadn't even been lingering. We ordered our food ten minutes after we arrived, and we ordered desserts pretty much as soon as we finished our mains. That alone is a reason to never go back.But the other one is the food. It's just mediocre overall, and for that it's really overpriced. A few dishes like the lamb souvlaki and the pierogi were excellent. But the French onion soup dumplings, one of their signature dishes, were a disappointment: Dry and not very flavorful. And some of the dishes were simply terrible: The fish tacos tasted very, very fishy and were also almost comically small. The crab cake corn dogs had basically no flavor at all.

This is my stamp of approval for best chicken and waffles. They do a cheddar waffle with fried chicken, a corn pudding with a balsamic glaze. Holy Jesus, this is an excellent dish. The Stanton Social Beef Wellington- This is another great dish but some might find the slight livery taste to be off putting. It's a cooked filet with a foie gras mousse and mushrooms wrapped in puff pastry. I like this dish some much because I love every element of the dish. The filet, the foie gras, mushroom and puff pastry all work to make a great end product. French Onion Soup Dumplings- This dish is very unique, I think it's a good dish but not amazing. And it is so freakin hot when it's served, so wait a few minutes. It's served in the dish escargots are usually served in. It a deconstructed version of french onion soup, it has a dumpling with the french onion soup with a crouton on top with melted cheese covering the entire dish.Kobe Philly- I don't know why I liked this dish so much, it was also barely the size of a hot dog bun, so don't expect to get full. The truffle and goat cheese fondue are excellent with the beef, it's only a few bites but they are a very good few bites.Warm Doughnuts- This dish, depending who you ask, is either good or wet dream good.

Some of the higher points were those French Onion Soup dumplings -- I don't care what anyone says, if you like French onion soup and you like perfectly-caramelized onions, cheese and uber-flavor, you need these things in your life -- as well as the Huevos Rancheros, the Croque Monsier, etc. Foodwise I think our only criticism was the Chicken and Waffles which was simply (albeit definitely) above-average.Can't speak to the impressive cocktails -- we knocked back champagne and straight vodka tonics so that didn't come into play, but the drink menu is varied and creative and worth a peek or three.The real problem at Stanton isn't the food -- it's the 45-minute wait for a table despite having a reservation. It's the ear-splitting disco dance party that invades your personal and aural space while you're trying to decide what to order from the small plates tasting menu.It's the overflowing upstairs bathroom that requires bleach and janitorial services while you're enjoying an otherwise tasty, odor-free brunch.We really enjoyed brunch -- despite the silly wait and the sillier noise -- and we might even go back.

Personally I find that one of the most unreasonable policies especially for a restaurant that's more of a place for socializing than eating. It is meant for groups, and as common sense and logic dictate, the bigger the group is the more likely it is that people won't be arriving at the same time.

It should be called Sorority Palace or something.. no joke. It might have been just that particular Friday me and my (female- ha!) friends went, but I am pretty sure 80% of the clientele consisted of groups of girls. 3) Food was okay.

I have to start with the drinks, I ordered the strawberry fields, it contained the only two types of alcohol I actually like, grey goose and Riesling together? with strawberries? Yum oh Yum... I was already happy and not one tapa hit the table. One of my friends had the proseco Bellini, and the guys settled on beer and black magic which consisted of Guinness with champagne.

We were three girls, young professionals, trendily dressed, and we fit right into the scene here. It's a great place for cocktails and small plates. We were there on a weeknight, but it would be a perfect place to begin a night out (the cocktails are strong, the food is delicious but the small plates won't leave you stuffed, and the music gets you pumped up and wanting to go dancing).Drinks:Amazing. I love good cocktails. I had the Brooklyn Lemonade (gin), the Cranberry Flower (gin) and the Strawberry Fields (vodka). The gin drinks were best, but that is likely because I just prefer gin to vodka. My friends ordered other drinks (I don't remember which), but they enjoyed them. All the drinks were very tasty and packed a punch even though they didn't taste overly boozy. The combination of being boozy without tasting like it is the reason I'm willing to shell out $14/drink for a good cocktail. Food:Some menu items are good, and some are LIFE-CHANGING!! The potato-goat cheese pierogies and the French onion soup dumplings are two of the top 10 dishes I've ever had (and I'm a bit of a foodie). The Grilled Apple and Brie Quesadilla was great but nothing special (i can't image a quesadilla being bad haha), The chicken arepas were fine but not as good as Caracas (aka don't come here for the arepas, though they're certainly not bad if you're here and craving them). I think we also had the Oven-dried Tomato Pizzetta. Clearly, it was not memorable. Service:Great service, very attentive. We got a bit buzzed and silly, and our server was patient (I'm sure they're used to that, considering the strength and drinkability of their cocktails). After we'd paid our bill, we were still hanging out at the table, and the manager came over, wished me happy birthday, and invited us to the bar for a round of drinks on her. \u00a0Obviously, she wanted to turn the table over, which is annoying, but that was a classy and effective way to do so. She's been trained well. Summary:Amazing place. Fun for girl groups (can't speak for all men, but I know my boyfriend would have been annoyed to spend a lot of money on small plates). Great place to start a night out. Perfect for impressing out-of-town guests. Classy servers. Perfect cocktails. Get the Pierogies and the French Onion Soup Dumplings.

I absolutely loved every single thing we ordered. I made reservations at 8.30 to meet a couple of friends who were visiting from California. Due to the crappy weather, we only made it there by 9:00. The host just ignored us for about a couple of minutes but was nice enough to offer us a table in 30 minutes while we waited at the bar upstairs.

I had figured this place would be hip, but that was the understatement of the year. Owned by bad-boy chef Chris Santos of \"Chopped\" fame, this is the quintessential \"scene.\" \u00a0Holy crap, everyone was dressed to kill - this was one of the most attractive crowds I've ever seen, anywhere. These people take going out quite seriously. We arrived for our 9:30 reservation, and the place was just heaving, nearly bursting at the seams. Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait for some time. The hostess suggested we go upstairs and have a cocktail, which I gladly would have done, but for the fact that upon reaching the top of the stairwell, the bar area was packed, to the point of inducing claustrophobia. We headed back downstairs and informed the people up front we'd be waiting outside. The minutes pass. We look at the menu and decide what we want. More minutes pass. Uh-oh. This was not looking good. Am I too ugly to eat at this lounge/restaurant/nightclub? Nah, have faith. Finally, they came outside to get us, and led us back up the stairs to a row of small tables across from the bar. It needs to be said, this place is loud. The music, an excellent eclectic mix of indie, hip-hop, even micro-house, pumps from the speakers. If you want a chill, quiet dinner, this is so not the best option. Come prepared to get swept away with the madness. We had to squeeze into our table, with the tables left and right close enough for me to jab a fork over and grab someone else's food. I didn't, but trust me, I wanted to, because the plates here are well-presented and very tasty. Chef Santos is known for his whimsical, fun approach to tasty \"small plates\"-style dining, and that was in evidence on our visit, the kitchen having executed each dish to near-perfection. Our server told us that we should probably order anywhere from 4-6 plates - and she was accurate. We ordered 4, figuring we could always order more. As it turned out, 4 was enough. Just a quick note about the service - I was a little worried that it'd be snooty, but no, once we were seated, it was efficient and friendly all the way. They started us off with an amuse-bouche - that always puts me in a good mood. We first ordered red snapper tacos with avocado. Bright and flavorful, these were a great start, the briny snapper matching perfectly with the avocado and a splash of lime. Crab cake corn dogs were equally enjoyable, the classic carnival treat given the gourmet treatment with succulent crab. While those two plates were excellent, it was the French Onion Soup Dumplings that threw the meal over the top. The experience of eating these dumplings was quite literally like taking \"bites\" of French onion soup, drenched with cheese. Really good French onion soup.....and I don't even typically like it all that much. Eating these dumplings is almost pornographic - take a bite, and the soup just kinda bursts onto your palate with massive flavor. Another item I don't usually order at restaurants is chicken & waffles, but here they sounded too good to resist, with an aged cheddar waffle, corn pudding, and balsamic maple syrup. Many iterations of this dish are on the sweet side, but this was all savory, with perfectly cooked chicken and the cheddar waffles with just the right amount of salt - this could have easily gone in an overly salty direction, but it was kept under control. The balsamic maple syrup was awesome - both intensely tart and sweet at the same time. My ONLY criticism here - really my only criticism of the whole meal - was that I could have stood just a little bit more of the syrup. Admittedly, this stuff *is* potent, so I understand the restraint - but I would have liked to soak the waffles with a tiny bit more. I should also mention the cocktails. We only ordered one apiece, in an attempt to keep the bill under control. I ordered a variant of an Old Fashioned, \"fashioned\" with tequila and blueberry. Very interesting, layered cocktail. It came as no surprise that the cocktails here are well-crafted. I could have easily enjoyed cocktails, but then again, I was trying to minimize the damage somewhat. Dessert was Guinness toffee cake with toffee sauce and Bailey's ice cream. That was decadent. A cake made from Guinness plus ice cream made from Bailey's? Are you kidding me? Sold. It was every bit as great as it sounds - not the least bit ham-handed as some rich desserts like this can be. Oh, and we also had to have a gingerbread Twinkie with pumpkin cream cheese filling. It tasted like fall - and again, by no means overbearing and cloying as one would expect of a \"Twinkie.\" In summary, be prepared to party, and eat great food. Based on what I saw, while I'm not sure if a reservation is theoretically necessary - if you want to come here on a Friday night, I'd strongly recommend making one.", "Date": "2012-10-09", "Author_Location": "Miami, FL"}, {"Author": "Derrick T.", "ReviewID": "tAgB5wbkHR_IsKHn4n_DAw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As you can see from researching the rest of their reviews and their website, they serve small plates or tapas.

Full of fixing and a good amount of fish, this makes a great start to your meal. \u00a0The snapper itself was mild (as snapper should be), so this was light and enjoyable.The Edamame was deeeeelcioso! \u00a0It's covered in a fish oil, but don't let that fool you, it does not taste like fish on the least. \u00a0It tastes like grilled heaven trapped in a pea pod!But from here, it gets worse.Chicken and Waffles were a nice idea but I found this dish to be poorly executed. \u00a0Anyone can fry a chicken wing and put it on top of an Eggo waffle, which is essentially what this was. The Kobe Beef Sliders were good if not run of the mill. \u00a0They tasted like any one of a million burgers with nothing to make it stand out. \u00a0Boring ingredients, boring presentation, served with boring fries. \u00a0The deserts were all overly sweet. \u00a0The mousse, the doughnuts, the cookies... None of it was balanced so I can't say I would recommend any of it. \u00a0In fact, the doughnuts came with caramel dipping sauce, in case two tablespoons of sugar wasn't sweet enough... You're better off walking up to Little Italy for desert.To elaborate on the \"mediocre service\", we were left waiting for drinks countless times. \u00a0It would take 15 minutes to get a beer, and at one point we went to the bar, ordered drinks, brought them back to the table, and finished... BEFORE the waitress brought the round we ordered through her! \u00a0Management seemed to care less when we complained, typical of this type of restaurant that cares more about being hip than their service.", "Date": "2013-05-21", "Author_Location": "New Fairfield, CT"}, {"Author": "John C.", "ReviewID": "15ykc203EwE89km8KKaktQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The food was original and delicious but the service was absolutely terrible.

I came here on two very different occasions. The first time was a Friday night dinner with the BF. Reservations were easy enough to make and I had no trouble changing the time of my reservation even a few hours beforehand, but we still ended up waiting about 45 minutes after our 10:30 reservation for our table to be ready. The waiting area is the upstairs bar. I say \"bar\" but it's more like a club/lounge - excessively loud music and scantily dressed girls with fancy cocktails in hand. On the weekends, the upstairs area is probably perfect for a ladies' night out, but it's not really my type of scene so I was glad when we were finally ushered downstairs.The dining style is small plates so the waitress recommended about 2-3 items per person. I ordered the red snapper tacos and lobster roll. The tacos were amazing - the fish itself was cooked just right, and the spicy mango and avocado created a wonderful mixture that went really well with the fish. The lobster roll was also delicious. The lobster was cold, which was unexpected, and I usually don't like my seafood cold, but the sauce that the lobster was mixed with was so perfect that I didn't even mind. The roll managed to be crispy and buttery - amazing!The BF is a vegetarian and unfortunately, there aren't that many vegetarian options on the menu. He ordered the potato & goat cheese pierogies, the baked spanakopita, and the grilled ovendried tomato pizzeta. He doesn't eat anything that's been cooked in a meat broth either so that ruled out the French onion soup dumplings. I had a few bites of his food, and they didn't seem nearly as good as what I had ordered, although he seemed to have enjoyed his meal very much.We also each ordered a cocktail. I had the strawberry fields, which was a tad too sweet for my taste. The BF had the blood orange-jalapeno margarita, which seemed like a daring choice, but it turned out to be pretty good!The second time I was here was for a social event for work. It was a Monday evening so there weren't many people. We sat on the couches in the upstairs lounge area, which was comparably much more pleasant in atmosphere than the Friday night scene. We ordered an assortment of dishes to share and all were good. I finally got to try the French onion soup dumplings that so many Yelpers have recommended and it was indeed quite delicious. We also had these amazing donuts for dessert, and it came with three types of dip - chocolate, caramel, and raspberry. I think the donuts were by consensus the best items of the night.Overall, I'd give 3 stars for my Friday night experience and 5 stars for my Monday evening experience.", "Date": "2013-06-30", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Leslie C.", "ReviewID": "zauM4zLUrFCtLkCQ_YT0jw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "On my first night in NYC, my friend suggested happy hour at the Stanton Social. \u00a0We arrived right when they opened at 5pm and sat at their bar upstairs. \u00a0We ordered the brisket sliders and pierogies and washed them down with the Strawberry Fields cocktail (I believe- since this review is pretty late and the bartender suggested it). \u00a0The food was rich, maybe slightly heavy but great after a long flight. \u00a0instagram.com/p/WiH2k-OF\u2026The place is sophisticated yet casual and the staff was very friendly. \u00a0I can imagine taking a date there or just happy hour with co-workers at the bar.", "Date": "2013-05-16", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Rahul P.", "ReviewID": "o9FiN02dXoIeRNLrnpaMxA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came on a Friday night with 9:30 reservations. As with what seemed to be everyone else, we were told to head upstairs to the bar and grab a drink until our table was ready. A little after 10:00, we managed to get seated. From other reviews here, I guess this is just their practice to send people to the bar and squeeze more out of them, so come with the right set of mind. Beyond that, I can't complain about the service level. Everything was served promptly, and our waitress was pretty regular in checking in on us and being patient. The Stanton features great, trendy decor and fantastic music, the atmosphere is borderline nightclub so I don't recommend this place for an intimate, quiet night out at all. From what I could see all around me, this is the place to be for groups of women having girls' night out. The food is a mixed bag, I'd rate it a 3-3.5 Yelp-wise. We went with the French Onion Soup Dumplings, the Crab Cake Corndogs, the Mac and Cheese, the Chicken and Waffles and the Souvkali. Soup Dumpings - Overhyped;; Loved the cheese melted all over them, but otherwise I don't love French Onion soup anyhow and the chewy texture was not my thing, but I could see people loving it. The Macaroni and Cheese was out of this world, excellent crunchy texture and seasoning and of course rich and served in a small cast iron pan - delicious! The Souvlaki was also excellent, the cuts of lamb were perfect even if the portion size was quite small for this one. The Crab Cake Corn Dogs were a unique twist and I also highly recommend these as part of your tapas picks. The big disappointment was the Chicken and Waffles. The chicken could have been any generic grilled chicken, and it was served on top of soggy, not-so-tasty waffle pieces. This one was a major fail - I'd steer clear of it. Bottom line, this is a great place for a girls' night out where the goal isn't the finest food ever but just some small and creative small plates to get the night started in a trendy atmosphere.", "Date": "2013-06-16", "Author_Location": "Jersey City, NJ"}, {"Author": "Christine C.", "ReviewID": "ZqIvnJ-EJl-7HG__ps1mDA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Came here for dinner before a show at Bowery Ballroom.

Eh problem was I didn't really care for the sauce, then again in not a humongous fan of lamb so there is also that.

I have been wanting to try this place for months, but I just kept putting it off. So glad we came last night. Tranny - Our reservation is for 9pm. Me - I'm starving and it's 8pm. It IS a Monday, so I'm sure we can just go and they'll seat us early. 8:10pm - Walk through the door. PACKED HOUSE...... Um... It is Monday right??? So we actually had to wait until 9pm. We went upstairs to the bar to have a drink while we waited. I had the Oregon Riesling. Medium body, sweet and juicy. Very good... Amstel Light for Tranny. Around 9pm, we mosey on down stairs and we're promptly seated in the 1/2 circle, highbacked velvet booth. I LOVE this type of seating. Even though the place was loud, we could sit close to each other and actually have a conversation... Ok.. Ok... On to the food.

SO FUCKIN GOOD***Herb Dusted Frites - i love how they call them frites, but they are just normal french fries. Good, but nothing special ***Social Mac & Cheese - fuckin a... This was my favorite. Chunks of chorizo... The mini penne noodles... the cheese... Ahhh... Orgasm #9The music was awesome. A few times, I almost got up and started dancing...

Too well, in fact: The pre-dominantly twenty-something, manifest hip n well-heeled, commitment phobic crowd. Stanton Social delivers exceptionally well on that. Starting from the name: \"Social\" - crowded before 9 pm with \"girlfriends\", the girl:guy ratio in the dining hall is probably 7:3. The format, Tapas, also encourages conversation and socialization over dainty morsels of food as opposed to gastronomic indulgence. And, the eclectic menu spares the dining patrons from committing to a particular cuisine. Why opt for nearby Italian ('Inoteca) when you can choose sassy fusion offerings from diverse cuisines spanning Vietnamese, Japanese, Mexican, European, to the Plain Jane Mac & Cheese (gussied up with Chorizo)?\"You MUST try the French Onion Soup dumplings, they are the best I've ever had\", said our friendly neighbor. He was having dinner on the upper level of the restaurant, while throwing a birthday party for his daughter and her friends (celebrating in a separate room). Inspired no doubt from the likes of Mayor Bloomberg, and such others.I smiled back politely at him, while leaning across the table to whisper to my companion, \"See, I am not the only one who's a legend in his own mind\". The cynic in me had already decided that the man had read reports about diners \"sharing plates with each other\", and \"making lifelong friends\", as a result of being forced by the seating arrangement to invade each other's personal space. Dammit, I am the exact opposite of what this place aspires for - the anti (Stanton) social :) I don't suffer pretense gladly. That said, I can appreciate that their format works for me, IF I am in the LES. The Kobe beef sliders are the perfect size, given their richness and greasiness. {The word \"Sliders\" is also re-assuring for the B&T crowd that they aren't too far from home (White Castle)}. The potato and goat cheese pierogies, lamb souvlaki, spring rolls, red snapper tacos, frites - were all excellent! The Tapas were served two at a time, and the kitchen operates efficiently to make sure that you're ready to be social at the earliest (highlighting the inherent tension between their desire to churn tables and the invitation for people to socialize over cocktails and bites). I did say earlier that SS knows it market well, and the loud music encourages alcohol consumption (scientific research), borrowing a page from Murray Hill bars.The annoying neighbor was having his own Meg Ryan moment (from When Harry Met Sally) over the doughnut holes, but as we know better, we chose to skip the dessert at SS and instead went to SSS (Sugar Sweet Sunshine) nearby. The night was young, and what better way to fuel ourselves than with some Banana pudding, and peanut butter icebox pie at S3B. The contrast in warmth and contentedness was like night and day.

After all, its concept -well-rendered, delicious, not-atrociously-priced share plates for groups- transformed me into the type of girl who could discover and adore my current paramour, Traif (with the metaphysical ecstasy that I do). Don't let that early-millennium, Sex-and-the-City aesthetic that's a bit dated (but no less fascinating for out-of-towners) turn you off: the food is delicious. Unpretentious high-brow renderings of familiar favorites (e.g.: red snapper tacos, the droolsy French onion soup-dumplings, truffle-laced goat-cheese pierogies) are served at the palatable rate of one per diner, allowing you to custom-create a tasting menu of French-ish brunch or dinner for your party. The cocktail menu is accordingly SingleFabulousFemale-tastic, which is to say it's going to exasperate and bore some, but really, really appeal to the type that's been excited about commercial New York before. Even though I haven't been that girl for some time now, no hindsight bias or bitterness here - the SS gets my thumbs up any day of the week.", "Date": "2010-10-11", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Kathy V.", "ReviewID": "bRpxWzhVoV1QH0oGorDquA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Reservations needed, credit card hold and turn out to be MEH....

The truffle creme fraiche was beautiful. French Onion Soup Dumplings- These puppies come out nice and hot with loads of melted cheese on top. Each dumpling is bursting with flavor.

We perused the menu, I ordered another Manhattan Sidecar and we were off to the races. Theo and I rarely agree on dishes to share, but finally chose four that would make us both happy:1. French Onion Soup Dumplings - These were at the suggestion of our waiter, and he was right, they are incredible.2. Sweet & Sour Chicken and Cashew Spring Rolls - Not my favorite, but pretty good anyway, I would eat them again.3. Zucchini Tempura - YES PLEASE. Probably the best zucchini anything I have ever eaten. Yep, ever. 4. Spicy Lamb Souvlakis - I saved the best for last. How do you fit so much goodness in one tiny lamb bite? Clever chefs, always leave me wanting more. After licking my fingers clean (again, trying to be sexy...but I just don't think I am very good at that) and ordering another Sidecar, I was full and happy and frankly very tired. The excitement really got to me. Well, the excitement and the noise. Stanton Social had only one negative that I can see - it was crazy, headache inducing, ballpark-after-a-homerun-loud. I could barely hear Theo across our tiny table and when I did, I was keeping the conversation light, since I didn't want to scream personal information to him since the tables on either side of us were packed in really close.Once we left and my full and no longer sexy self dropped into a cab for the ride back to the UES, Theo and I agreed that The Stanton Social is perfect for girls night out, but a hot date? We will try something a little quieter next time, but hopefully the food is equally good.

I get it, they want to make money... but it was midnight, it wasn't crowded and I offered to pay the difference. I've never felt so crappy after visiting a restaurant. I came in at 11:30/12PM on a Fridayy night with my GF and asked to get dessert... the maitre de said we can eat dessert upstairs at the lounge... so we walked upstairs into the loud and over crowded bar scene. We walked back down because it was too crowded upstairs, and \u00a0we were hoping they would just sit us in the dining room, there were clearly tables available. The maitre de refused to sit us because we only wanted dessert, I even said I would pay 50 dollars just for desserts to make up for the fact that we weren't getting an \"appetizer, entree, and dessert\"... apparently if you don't get all three you can't eat there. What makes things worse, an elderly couple (mid 60's) walked down from the lounge at the same time we did, and the maitre de sat them, knowing they were only going to get desserts! Look I don't usual get mad about this kind of stuff... but a serious restaurant like Stanton Social, a place I've been a bunch of times, can't possibly think it's acceptable to treat customers like that. Honestly, I love chef Santos, and I am really sad that someone under his helm would treat a returning customer like this. It's just really bad business....I've been to a bunch of restaurants, waited hours for meals, had bad service... but this was just the worst.

\u00a0we even kept the dipping sauce - it was so GOOD!2) ricotta fritters with raspberry jamalso great, but after one of those doughnuts, it just doesn't compare. \u00a0not an overly cheesey flavor. \u00a0nicely sweetened by the raspberry jam.3) lemon blackberry silver dollar pancakesthese are probably great, but i'm never really in the mood for pancakes, so when i have one when i don't want them, i just eat them to eat them - which was the case here. \u00a0nothing to write home about, but the blackberries tasted fresh...4) breakfast bruschettascrambled eggs on crusty bread with ovendried tomatoes and asiago cheese. \u00a0these were yummy! \u00a0the ovendried tomatoes were not overpowering.5) fancy benedictthe lobster benedict was a bit difficult to share. \u00a0it was okay. \u00a0i thought the lobster was a bit overcooked though...6) bistro saladthis salad was great! \u00a0we all loved it. \u00a0it had huge chunks of bacon (lardons) which i originally mistook for a crouton - but it was a pleasant surprise...7) monte christo sliderthis was the only thing that we didn't like. \u00a0apparently the bread and/or accompanying sauce was sweet. \u00a0i didn't partake after the initial \"ew!\" that was uttered. \u00a0from what a remember, a monte christo is not sweet, but who knows?!8) rhode island lobster roll sliderbeing the b-day girl, i was gonna hog this little goodie all to myself, but i shared. \u00a0it was the perfect mixture of lobster, mayo and celery shoved into a roll and dusted with what i think was paprika. \u00a0it was delectable!**the sliders are not meant to be shared, but we all love each other, so we shared nibbles!9) potato and goat cheese pierogiesi was sure i was going to hate these, but they were quite surprising. \u00a0i'm not a fan of goat cheese, but sometimes i'll take a nibble. \u00a0these were the perfect combination of potato and goat cheese. \u00a0not too overpowering with goat cheese flavor. \u00a0the caramelized onions on top and the truffled creme fraiche dip were perfect!

I enjoyed the candles, low-lighting and the decor upstairs with the hand mirrors. \u00a0It definitely proved to be the perfect joint for a group gathering (like a birthday or a bachelor/ette party), date (especially if you snagged a spot in the lounge-y area by the upstairs bar) or a business type dinner.

My highlights, however, were the truffled cr\u00e8me fraiche that accompanied the pierogies -heavenly. They should consider selling it by the pint. The red snapper tacos were also outstanding. There was a nice crunch to the taco shell and the fish filling was perfectly paired with creamy avocado and spicy mango but didn't feel mushy. The tuna sashimi was incredibly light and fresh; a nice change from the heaviness/richness of the soup dumplings, ribs and chicken/waffles.We were able to find room to share some dessert. The donuts were hot-and-fresh-from-the-fryer-but-not-too-heavy and topped with sugar. Paired with chocolate, caramel and raspberry dipping sauces - they were pretty much like crack to a dessert whore. All in all, it was an amazing meal with great service.

$18 seems to be a great deal. \u00a0Until you find out the portions are no bigger than tapas sizes. \u00a0The idea here is shared plates, ideal for the non-committed. \u00a0You create your own meal and get a little sample of everything. \u00a0That can quickly add up.The order: 1) Goat cheese Perogies w/ caramelized onions and truffle creme fraiche. \u00a0Perogies (fried dumplings of unleavened dough) filled w/ herb infused goat cheese was delectable. \u00a0I'm no connoisseur of this Russian dish, but I like it. \u00a0Crispy fried outershell and creamy cheese worked perfectly together with just a dab of the smooth dipping sauce (truffle creme fraiche).2) Crabcake corndogs. \u00a0Juicy, lump crabmeat from Maryland encased in a blue corn meal batter, and skewered into wooden sticks. \u00a0It's a fun dish. \u00a0Nicely fried, the batter was hot and fluffy. \u00a0The interior is a flavorful mixture of crabmeat, Tabasco, chives and panko. \u00a0There's a corn-spiked dip to add a little more kick.3) Kobe Philly: thinly sliced kobe beef with truffle and goat cheese fondue. \u00a0This dish was yummy and gooey. \u00a0Only two bites worth. \u00a0The meat was very tender, while the truffle oil resonated through the cheesy sauce. \u00a0You can smell it.4) Rhode Island Style Lobster Roll: \u00a0Chunks of lobster w/ celery and mayo on a small brioche roll. \u00a0Another two bite roll. \u00a0It was light on the mayonnaise, but just too much celery for my liking. \u00a0It kinda dulled out the sweetness from the lobster meat.5) French Onion Soup Dumplings: \u00a0Their signature dish, this was our favorite of the night. \u00a0It has also appeared on an episode of \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\". \u00a0Served in a escargot tray, each dumpling was like a spoonful of soup. \u00a0Tooth-picked in a buttery dough, the stewed onions generally found at the bottom of the soup was captured in this fried dough. \u00a0Nice balance of sweetness from the caramelized onions and savoriness from the beef broth. \u00a0The baked Gruyere and Parmesan formed a beautiful crust on top. \u00a0Once you hoist that sucker and place it in your mouth... the explosion of flavors is wonderful. \u00a0They really nailed the French Onion soup flavor!I have to deduct a star for the long wait and the background music... it was loud, maybe too loud. \u00a0You can't really have a conversation without shouting to the other person. \u00a0Other than that the whimsical, innovative, and fun offerings truly make this place unique. \u00a0With sex appeal oozing inside, this place will always be a draw with the young crowd. \u00a0It never fails to see groups of girls dining here on Weekends. \u00a0I admit, I sneaked quick glances at several tables... checking out the \"hot dishes\" not produced from Stanton's Kitchen. \u00a0Sorry Honey!", "Date": "2011-05-12", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Billy C.", "ReviewID": "9uRuAb70L4G_MlMVWj0a1g", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wednesday, 7:30pm, we had reservations for 10 but only 5 eventually made it. \u00a0Checked in with the hostess and explained to her that the person in our party originally reserved for 10 but we only had 5 that evening. \u00a0She said it was 'Ok' and she asked us to go upstairs and she would call us when the table was ready. \u00a0I had a suspicious feeling that they were gonna make us wait for this and sure enough we did. \u00a0After waiting for 30 minutes upstairs, I head back down and the hostess said the table was ready. \u00a0Coincidence you ask? \u00a0Moving right along I say.The place itself is very nice. \u00a0High ceilings, 2 floors, well decorated. \u00a0Very cool. \u00a0Hip music playing in the background, a bit loud for conversations but still cool.Service was very good and attentive.As a rule, I try to research on Yelp before venturing to a restaurant, especially if it is going to be a pricey event. \u00a0So I already had prepared a list of this evening. \u00a0(Which we pretty much ordered everything on my list and then some)After perusing the menu we decided we would each order 2 dishes.- 4 Kobe Beef Sliders ($7 each, I thought it was $7 for 2 mini-burgers, how naive of me. \u00a0Good but will not re-order, cannot justify that it is over 6 times the price of a White Castle cheese burger)- French Onion Soup Dumplings ($11 for 6.

I was whisked away by the good grace of a few subway trains and arrived to find this, the most glorious restaurant that I have ever had the pleasure of dining at.Although the seating arrangement was rather cosy this only served to contribute to the ethos of the establishment - the dining here (as I'm sure most of you guys know) is designed for sharing. I *love* sharing food. If nothing else it means that one can try a touch of everything and there is oh-so-much-of-everything going on here. I have yet to find a better restaurant for this very purpose. There were several of us partaking in the food orgy and so we ordered around seven or eight dishes. Man they just kept coming! It was bloomin' awesome - the squid rolls (which have a much more delightful name than that, which I forget) were just delicious. The mini burgers (also with a better name) literally melted in my mouth and Mac and Cheese was unlike anything I've ever tried in my life. The food here simply put my entire history of cuisine experience to shame. Don't even get me started on the chocolate tasting session dessert and *ahem* red *velvet* twinky. That's the kind of twinky I want if the world is coming to an end. Or just the kind I want always and forever now. I dream in red velvet twinky.Yeah, so I've been a tad on the verbose side about this one, but it was \u00a0utterly amazing. Thank you world for making this happen.

First of all, I like the small plates idea. As someone who takes the entree decision very seriously, I like the option of not needing to commit to just one.

To be fair, we did not order dessert, but it still seemed fast to me. The waiter recommended a nice Beaujolais. It started off very dry, but opened up nicely over the course of the meal. I would recommend it. For plates we got:Red Snapper Tacos: These could have been SO much better. They weren't bad, but they needed a big boost of flavor. They came with a chipotle mayonnaise that was just a big ball of heat, no real flavor. French Onion Soup Dumplings: These were great. Different. Great Flavor, made me want an actual bowl of the soup. Kobe Beef Sliders: Very good, a little too much ketchup for my taste, but cooked perfectly. I would say these are the standout item from the ones we chose. Pickle Guy Pickles: Good, as usualChicken N' waffles: The chicken part was a little weak, but the waffles were good, as was the funky soy- molasses tasting \"syrup\". All in all, I think it was a good experience. For two of us, including the bottle of wine, we were just over \u00a0$100, which I think is a good value.

This is provably the most overhyped, overpriced place i've experienced in Manhattan. Let me qualify that a bit further by saying you should not go here hungry looking to eat dinner. The service is fine. the dishes are okay. The prices are beyond exorbitant. The words \"small portion sizes\" do not begin to properly describe the servings. The portions are tiny. i went there in a group of 6, around 10p on a Friday night. We sat upstairs because they had a table available right away in a cozy nook towards the front. We shared our area with a 2 other girls who were already there. I, for one, don't mind being seated near people I don't know; i'm a social creature like that. The crowd was made up primarily of people in their early to mid 20's. The decor itself was nothing special.The food was okay. Given the size of our group, we sampled a pretty extensive portion of the menu. Be warned, the portions are insanely small. The French Onion Dumplings were a hit; they also provably the most healthy portions of any item on the menu. However, each dumpling was no more than an inch in diameter, about the size of your thumb from the knuckle to the tip. The Kobe Beef Burger sliders were okay, nothing insanely special. The sashimi was low grade. The red snapper tacos were very nice. My favorite dish was a bruschetta with goat cheese and piquillo pepper. I had 2 servings because I knew I would not be returning. \u00a0I was still hungry after everything. Most of us only had 1 drink with dinner, as we were going out after. Our grand total was a little over $300. My biggest complaint about this place is the portion size. It's simply not worth it. For example (i've used this one before), I can go to Buddakan and get healthier portions on more creative dishes in a far more stylish environment for less. If your aim is to party in the Lower East Side, just catch a cab after your meal. It's not that far.

The Gruyere cheese and the red wine based beef broth made this a revelatory experience. One of the few hyped dishes that I've eaten that earned their reputation. Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies with Black Truffle Creme Fraiche - Oh...my...gah. Crispy potato dumplings with tangy goat cheese served with the absolute best creme fraiche. The star of the meal. Chicken and Waffles - Boo yah. Perfection on a plate. The corn and balsamic vinegar sauce really took this dish to another level. Kobe Beef Slider - Very good. Not great. Good beef, but slightly underwhelming considering the cost ($7 for a slider...). Brie and Apple Quesadilla - Absolutely scrumptious. Crispy and tangy - bar food perfected. Spinach and Goat Cheese Ravioli - Thin, tender ravioli casing containing a truly perfect filling. So good. Old Fashioned Meatballs - Tasty, but slightly rare for my liking. Strawberry Shortcake - Delicious as expected. Red Velvet Twinkie - Slightly dry and overly sweet. The one misstep in the meal. Sugared Donuts - Reminiscent of Chinese take-out donuts.

There's a bar upstairs that your group can grab drinks at before you sit down for dinner.

Your group gets to try 11 different items - 7 tapas, 2 sides, and 2 desserts - \u00a0that you select from a set menu that includes many of their most popular items.

The flavor was good, but the presentation was a bummer-spinach salad; I wish that I'd requested a substitution for this on the prix fixe menu, because it was just a downer after the other glorious food.I really recommend this place for large parties, because they have service down cold and I observed no lapses.

Two things we did not order, or anticipate having to deal with when we booked the reservation 31 calendar days in advance. When we arrived we were welcomed by a slightly overwhelmed Matire'D who told us we couldn't be seated until our entire party had arrived, which is totally understandable, so we decided to go upstairs to the bar and have a drink and wait. When the hostess came to tell us our table was ready, she told us a minimum of three times in a very short time frame, tapping on different members of the party trying to rush \u00a0them to our table. When we finally did get our drinks at the bar, we were rushed off to our \"table\" In the \u00a0lofted area of restaurant. The only reason I even gave this second star is because, I want to take this time to say that the restaurant is beautiful. The set up is great, and if you have a smaller party, then I am sure you can not relate to this review. The drinks were great, the food was delicious (some meals better than others, but that is to be expected) \u00a0but this next part is what ruined the entire dining experience, and if you are contemplating bringing a large party here, please read this part carefully. There is somewhat of a lofted platform seating where there is one long bench and two half tables so that it can accommodate two large parties, or attempt too. One table is underneath a staircase. Then there is another table off to the side for larger parties as well. On the back wall is a display of wine bottles that is in an illuminated casing. When our party was seated we were wedged into the table that was underneath the staircase up against the illuminated display. To add to the discomfort of squeezing seven people at a small table, the air conditioning wasn't working on our level. So our two guests in our party that were up against the casing were literally hotter than the food being served. When we asked if we could move to another table our waitress, who was possibly the rudest woman I have ever encountered in an industry that is based on service , told us no because the other party that was going to sit there was a larger party. When we mentioned the heat she replied \"it's hot everywhere, I'm hot, I know\". I am not complaining at all about the fact that we couldn't be moved. I understand that there was a larger party. However, they were not larger than our party, \u00a0until we were about 80% finished with our meal, which is interesting because when we arrived it was \"policy\" that they needed everyone present, prior to seating. I could go on and on about how horrible the service was, that they basically left us to cook in a lofted hot box, while our server clearly displayed her lack of knowledge towards the industry, and how to have simple manners. Or I could address the fact that when we finally did speak with a manager she fed us a list of excuses. Such as the ac is broken, (which would have been an acceptable response, had the waitress stated that when we initially asked), Or that the Matire'D made mistakes with the other party, why was our party punished for that? This place literally has no loyalty towards customers who make reservations so far in advance with large parties. My main issue is as follows, and I am sorry it has taken so long to get here,. The Stanton Social is so greedy, they literally do not care about the customers, the dining experience, or the word of mouth that will follow. You can not comfortably pack three large parties into a space that would accommodate, maybe one large party, and a 5/6 top AT MOST. It was so obvious to the three parties that we were there to pay the bill, not to enjoy the food, atmosphere, or company. \u00a0My party, was celebrating a birthday we planned to go out after and have a night to remember, NOT sweat off our make up, have our curls unravel, stick to the chair, and listen to our waitress' disgusting attitude.The manager's way to rectify the situation, was to give us her card for next time? Which completely solidifies the fact that this restaurant does not value customer service, or proper staff training, but only values the settling of the check. You can live in NYC the rest of your life and dine at a new place every night. Why would you go back to a place that ruined a celebratory dinner and didn't care enough to rectify the situation, when they had the chance? I could have had this experience for free if I put on the heat in my house, served my friends in a closet, and hired a disgruntled teenager to drop in every once in a while.

Sure, you will still feel like a mere mortal as you wait to be seated for 30-40 minutes, even though you arrived for your reservation on time; perhaps you'll feel a little less than human when the doorman asks to see your ID twice in the span of 5 minutes because he doesn't remember checking it already; and maybe you'll feel a little insignificant when you are seated in a tiny space in an overly deep bench seat/table type seating arrangement, with your date seemingly miles away. But then you order your food and it all changes. As you look down on the plates of food that are presented, you'll feel like the Giant looking down on a miniscule Jack. You'll wonder if you have just been transported to a trendy restaurant in a modern age Gulliver's Travels. The bite size morsels, as delicious as they are, will pop into your mouth and disappear, like magic, seemingly without even needing you to chew. You will order and order, eat and eat, like a leviathan at a feast for leprechauns. Finally, you will be full and call for the check. When you see the bill, you will be transported back to reality, and realize that you are just another average sized person in the big city.

I always enjoy taps in a large group because you can just order a bunch of stuff for the table and try almost the entire menu in some cases.That being said, there are many restaurants who see tapas as a way to essentially charge more money per ounce of food. While an entree might start around $25 at a typical nice restaurant, a tapas restaurant, like Stanton Social, can get away with charging $19 for a much smaller amount of food. This would be fine, if the food were actually worth that price.Out of the five dishes we ordered, not one was remarkable, and two were downright terrible. First up, we had the Chipotle Grilled Shrimp and the Red Snapper Tacos. The shrimp was a little tough and rubbery, but the flavor was decent. The tacos were on par with the shrimp--nothing stellar, but an OK way to start a meal, assuming what's to follow is even better.Next came the Beef Carpaccio, which was slightly bland and had an overly wet texture. I've had better at steakhouse chains that do most of their business at lunch during the work week. Finally, the last two, and most potentially exciting dishes, arrived. Squash and Pumpkin Ravioli, and Chicken & Waffles. The ravioli had a desserty sweetness about it, and wasn't bad, although it was unevenly heated with parts of it warm, and other parts room temperature. The Chicken & Waffles. What can I say other than this was the worst plate of food I've had in a restaurant in years. The chicken was dry, tough, rubbery, and tasteless. The waffle was...well, see the adjectives I used to describe the chicken. The experience was like eating sand. Maybe if they didn't use frozen waffles and actually made them fresh, they wouldn't taste like an old, dried up sponge. With cocktails, which were cloying and unremarkable, this meal ran $150 plus tip, and was barely worth half of that.

Sure, the food and cocktails are delicious, but it'd all be even more appetizing if you didn't have to stare at people's back sweat and pit stains while sipping your $13 cocktail tinged with your own salty upper lip sweat. However, the place is trendy-hot for a reason: the food. Here's my take:- French onion dumplings: yes, they're worth the hype. Try 'em. If you're health conscious, try a little of 'em. Very creative dish you can't find elsewhere, and the cheesy, french onion flavor is spot-on.- Red snapper tacos: really good. These crunchy baby tacos are packed to the rim with really flavorful fish and fresh mango (that's not spicy, despite the description). Loved that the \"miso mayo\" is on the side.- Pierogies: recommended by many people (and the staff) for a reason - they're packed with deliciousness. Not the light, boiled/steamed variety, but the richness makes them great for sharing.- Tuna sashimi: fuggedaboudit. I ordered this because I wanted at least one healthy, light dish, but not worth it. Fresh, but completely passable and overpriced at $15.- Kobe beef and Philly cheesesteak sliders: flavorful and not skimpy on the meat. Philly's the one to go with here - mostly beef with only a light drizzle of white cheese and not your typical greasy, tough cheesesteak.- Zucchini and goat cheese pizzette: not very memorable or necessarily any better than similar dishes served elsewhere, but definitely tasty and a good balance to many of the other menu options.- Complimentary tequila gazpacho shots: AMAZING!!!! These were brought to our table by another waitress without a word, so we're not entirely sure they were meant for us, but dayamn - they were refreshing and unique.- \u00a0Strawberry Fields: great cocktail - the strawberries are actually \"real\" and not some sugary, syrupy compote. Perfect summer drink. FYI: the graham cracker rimmed glass is no more.The arrival of all of the dishes was timed very well - we never waited long, and we weren't overwhelmed by too many dishes at once.

But everything in life is about timing and it just happened that it took this long for me and Stanton Social to cross paths. We arrived early for our reservations, was asked to have a drink in the upstairs bar. No problem, the lounge was loungey and the bartender was attentive. It was a Tuesday night and the crowd was light which I was glad for since I was actually able to hear my date. We didn't have to wait long and was escorted to the first level where our table was waiting for us. It was a bit crowded where we sat but the place itself is just cozy. If you are the type that likes your conversations private, I suggest you ask specifically for a booth ahead of time, or else the party next to you will hear your arguments. The food is tapas style and the menu was a good size. The good thing about it is that there is absolutely something for everyone on that menu. The tried and true safe people, like myself and the more adventurous ones like my husband. We each found something we loved and something we both wouldn't touch again.

Disclaimer: this place is more like a rowdy, snobby club (at least on a Friday night) than it is a fine-dining restaurant or a cute tapas bar. So don't come here expecting an intimate type of setting -- unless by \"intimate\" you mean literally pushing, squeezing, and shoving the huge crowd gathered around the front of the restaurant to find the over stressed and overwhelmed, yet careless and snotty hostess. Let me explain: Not one, but at least two or three different waitresses and hostesses gathered upfront at different times over almost a two hour period, who only acknowledged European white boys or to a lesser extent, club-attired (i.e. revealing clothed) white girls (so yes, dress fancy or at least, non-conservative)...everyone else, you'll have a particularly hard time getting her attention to enter -- even if you've made a reservation. She condescendingly eyed me, stared me down, with a curt, snappy retort and acted as if I was the impatient rude one when I've been politely standing next to her for at least 30 minutes while she ignored me (among some others). I am not exaggerating, and the moment the friend who I was meeting up with went inside to see if she could be more effective (as in, finally get her attention or whatnot), she realized what I meant, and we left. A LOT of girls and couples were leaving, especially once they realized how rude the workers were...some of us just glancing each other in misery before leaving. Honestly, reservations mean NOTHING here...they'll call you beforehand to confirm, and tell you to be on time, and you'll think oh wow, this must mean they will actually take into account a reservation and go by it...but NO, once you finally get a hold of the hostess and yell over the noise, you realize she's sending you upstairs to the dingy (and yes, crowded to the brim so that you're dangling off the stairs) bar. What's the point of a reservation if you overbook and make would-be customers wait for over an hour? It's a really flawed, frustrating system.Anyway, I was really excited to try this place after my mom had seen it on TV and wanted me to take photos of the tiny dishes...but that's not something I'll be doing any time soon...in fact, don't bother attempting photos during dinner because it is again, like a club, dark inside.", "Date": "2013-11-05", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Jen L.", "ReviewID": "YdkQefBJO3l1sJKNtaHzRQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fun, social place with great tasting food!

I couldn't resist. The brunch menu sounded amazing. I was struck. I needed to go to The Stanton Social. I love Brunch with a passion. It's the perfect grouping of items, in portions small enough to eat, and at a time when our minds are sober enough to appreciate the food that enters our mouth. It's the perfect meal, the morning after... The brunch items at The Stanton are small in portion, like a Tapas style meal of sorts. It is designed to encourage sharing among friends. Since we were sharing, that meant we could eat more right? Oh, how I love to delude myself to justify my gluttony. Isn't it interesting how we make up excuses to justify our incorrigible behavior, just because we don't want to accept the truth? :oPMy friend and I toasted our meal with blushing Pomegranate-Peach Bellinis which were tart and fruity. Then we went hog wild with our pickin's. I love Eggs Benedict and was immediately drawn to the Fancy Benedict, which I had to order. It consisted of Lobster and grilled Asparagus served over toasted Brioche, topped with a poached egg and drizzled with Bernaise Sauce. On the side was a pile of perfectly dressed baby greens. The Lobster tail was moist, the asparagus sweet, the toast buttery, and the egg...ah, the yolk was oozy and perfect, coating everything that laid beneath it and further enrichening the Bernaise. The dish was amazing. It was sooo good. I was in love.Our meal proceeded on with the Breakfast Bruschetta, which consisted of slabs of crusty bread, toasted and topped with oven dried diced tomatoes, soft scrambled eggs, and shavings of Asiago cheese. It was a nice, light intercession before the courses ahead. Next came the Brie and Apple Quesadillas, drizzled with Honey and dusted with chile powder. Sweet but not too sweet, counterbalanced by the savory Brie. It was really good.And then came the Sliders. Maybe it's because I'm small, but I love dishes that are little. They're so cute. Ok, as a self-proclaimed foodie, I'm aware that it's blasphemy to describe food as cute. The cute factor should be reserved for rating the boys, i.e. Bobby Dean...oh he's so dreamy! Anyhow, getting back :oP... I just think that little burgers and sandwiches are adorable. They fit in one hand and can be devoured instantly. It's all about instant gratification I say.We ordered two sliders: The first was the Kobe Beef Burger and the second was the Monte Christo. The Kobe was cooked to medium rare, which is how I like my meat. Only downside was that the outside was underseasoned and too charred, which imparted a bitter taste that overpowered the sweetness of the meat. Quite umimpressive. As for the Monte Christo, it was a hit. The sandwich was filled with slices of ham, turkey, and swiss, soaked in a an egg custard and cooked until set. What made it extra luxurious was that it was steeped in a bath of lightly sweetened maple syrup and honey. The eggy bread was soft and succulent, dripping with maple and perfectly balanced with the savory, oozing filling. A sandwich this perfect has now set the bar for all the sandwiches that is to come. I just can't go back to a standard sandwich after this one. I'm spoiled! To round out the meal, my friend wanted to try the Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies, which I let her have full reign over. I'm a sucker for pierogies, especially fried ones like these. I could only sample a bite, but It was really good from what I can tell. My friend loved them. I think these were her faves. The pierogies were served with a pile of caramelized onions and a pool of Truffle Creme Fraiche. It's one thing about not eating the pierogies, but it's another thing when it comes to the creme fraiche. I dipped my finger, my spoon, and any other food item I had on my plate into that creme because it was wickedly just...that...good. How can you go wrong with truffles and creme fraiche? You just can't. It's perfection. Perhaps some may beg to differ, but I thought the brunch at The Stanton was amazing. The food was good, the service quick and attentive, and the setting lovely. I would definitely return back for another round of brunch.

The Staton Social is a big place with top notch decor and pretty good service. As far as brunch goes the menu consists of small plates (most of them meant for sharing), they're brought to your table continuously so nothing gets cold and you can pace your experience. Plan on getting a couple to share and a couple to selfishly keep to yourself (plates are around $6-12). Portions are small but that's so you can order more plates and try new things. The quality of the food is nearly perfect. Out of everything we tried the best and most memorable were the... -Pancakes (Caramelized Banana w/ candied pecans) ($8): these were tiny (think silver dollar pancakes) but were packed with flavor and were the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. -Warm Donuts w/ caramel ($8): These were a pile of a few soft warm cinnamon and sugar donut holes served with a warm caramel dipping sauce -Sausage Biscuit and Gravy ($6): This was sadly another small portioned plate but was one of the only good biscuits and gravy I've yet to have in the city.

Not all the time and not black tie, but I like dressing up a bit and indulging. Especially on special occasions and Stanton Social is a good place for this. Even as you walk in you get an instant impression of its vibe: cool, low-lit, trendy. To start, their specialty cocktails, served both in the cozy second floor bar-lounge and the high ceilinged first floor restaurant, are very well mixed and more varied than \"this is our special margarita because we use [insert liquor here].\" \u00a0When we were brought to our table (we scored one of the cozy circular booths) we were given a complimentary glass of champagne to begin our celebration, a very nice gesture.Food is served \"family style,\" though I prefer to think of it as American-tapas. Family style always makes me think of large plates sitting in the middle of the table with large spoons dangling out of piles of pasta. These are small-plates with anywhere from 2 to 8 bites each. We shared the warm piquillo pepper bruschetta (2 servings), wild mushroom risotto cakes (3 servings), pulled chicken arepas (3 servings), short rib tacos (3 servings), yellowfin tuna sashimi (6 or 8 servings), and lobster rolls (1 per order). It seems like so much food, but the plates are quite small... small and delicious.Initially I had selected a bottle of bordeaux but they were sold out of it and we chose a rioja instead. Our waitress, who I'd like to add was just darling, commented that it was one of her favorite wines and that it was a better selection. Granted, this could be just something wait-staff is supposed to say but she wasn't wrong. This wine was delicious: spicy and just the right amount of dry. My fellow celebrant ordered a glass of ice wine at the end of our meal to go with our shared desserts of \u00a0warm donuts that come with dipping sauces (caramel, bittersweet chocolate, and raspberry) and the apple pie sundae (warm apple bites, pie crust crumbs, and cinnamon ice cream). I left feeling full, happy, and sated.The negatives? It's pretty loud in there. Granted, after a little you adjust to the noise level and start talking louder or get closer to your dining partners (depending on who you eat with this could be good or bad). Speaking of getting closer, it's also pretty crowded in here. We visited on a Wednesday night and it was busy, I can only imagine a Saturday night and a Sunday brunch.

Came here with another Mrs. T on a weeknight. We got here at 6:15 and it was empty which was lovely because we got to enjoy the serene ambiance. Hard to see dim lighting and candles is the setting. We got a booth at the back of the restaurant which gave a 180 degree awesome view of the restaurant. The downside of being seated of this this booth was being close to the only restroom which happens to be unisex, eeww. We ordered way much tapas for just two people! The tapas summary: -potato and goat cheese perogies, very delish. If u love cheese get this, goat cheese is very creamy fill. This is a must try. -french onion soup dumplings, as the other yelpers noted, this is overrated. The other Mrs. T liked the crouton better that came with the dumpling. The dumpling was delish, good amount of onions in a bite size dumpling. The melted cheese that coated the top was very stiff, chewy texture and no longer warm as we ate it. The idea of a soup dumpling may sound creative, but the soup is better being served in a bowl. -Crab corn dogs: delish. This concept I like, crab meat in a corn dog. -Kobe beef burger: very good, meat is very tender. This burger is not a must have, even if it is Kobe beef, not worth the $7 per slider. -Chicken n waffles: this was good, but forgettable. There are four pieces. This one was also a not must have. -Mac n cheese with chorizo, \"can I have some more, sir?!\" There was a top layer of panko bread crumbs that were sprinkled generously all over mac and cheese in mini little pan. The panko bread crumbs and chorizo gave this mac and cheese a more unique twist. This was our favorite as it was the winner. -dessert: the chocolate tasting. It came with chocolate ice cream, mini peppermint patties, chocolate mousse, mini oreos, and panna cotta. Ice cream, peppermint patties, are oreos are very delish for that chocolate addict. The mousse is good, had that bittersweet flavor. The panna cotta looked like it had chocolate flavor but it did not taste like chocolate and had a lemon flavor to it. We enjoyed our evening here. Service here is attentive. Plates cleared right away and provide new plates for you after receiving new tapas. The one little mishap was the waitress spilled hot water from our teacups as she was setting down. She was very apologetic. The wait staff cleaned it up right away. The serene atmosphere turned into a loud and lively social event. The music is blasting into your ears over you from the hanging speakers. Where I was sitting, my ears were protected under the overhead that housed the loft like bar area. It wasn't til I was walking through the restaurant that I felt I was in a concert. You have to shout at the person sitting next to you. As we left, the long line for the bathroom was similar to the long line at the DMV. As noted earlier, only one restroom for all. Me thinks they should invest in separate restrooms that have at least two stalls. They are making lots of $$$ off the $7/sliders and $13/cocktail. I would come here again to have a socially good time and try other tapas. This place is great with a group of friends.

How did everyone disregard the smell? I know it has Onion in the name but it smelled like cheetos and old feet. Nevertheless I ate it because everyone RAVED about it. It was ok, but not as delectable as i had imagined it would be. We also had some spring roll thing- it was good.chipotle shrimp- TO. DIE. FOR. Potato Ravioli- Gooddonuts- warm little munchkins of goodnessAnd some other things I cant remember. Overall the food was good, But most of the really popular dishes disappointed me. It must have been around 1030/11 pm and within 40 mins all the food was consumed. Considering I havent eaten anything all day, The amount of food we consumed at the stanton left me pretty full.It became insanely busy, and maybe thats why our waitress had forgotten about us? We were ready for more drinks, and finding the waitress or summoning her was incredibly difficult. The lounge was SO loud. Conversation was near impossible! That could also be because the over the top stevie nicks/madonna/ montell jordan that was blasting on the speakers or someones 36th birthday party was happening behind us...Waitress came FINALLY after one of us had to physically get up and find her, we ordered final round of drinks.

It was cooked and shredded to tender perfection in an absolutely delicious sweet and tangy BBQ sauce.

These were good but were overshadowed by their Beef Wellington which was as good as any I've had anywhere. Grilled filet mignon with foie gras mousse and mushroom duxelles, wrapped in puff pastry.

The food here was of very high quality and the wait staff was able to, for the large part, time the dishes coming out of the kitchen so when we were done with one dish the next was ready.

The donuts we had for dessert were fresh and hot and plentiful, I found it a challenge to get through 2 of them, that's how rich they are!.

They were extremely accommodating and gave us no attitude when we brought in a pie from Billy's Bakery to serve as dessert (there is a plating fee). We were seated upstairs in a very nice long table/booth. Dark, loud, but really quite swanky without being tacky, it was the perfect atmosphere: our table was neither too crowded nor too removed from the rest of the buzz of the restaurant. Ordering is extremely easy. Come with a large group and you can order family-style, and they will customize the dishes so that everyone gets a taste. Everything was delicious: quality ingredients, innovative dishes, really just perfect execution. The amount of alcohol we imbibed prevents me from recalling everything we ate, but the french onion soup dumplings, and red snapper tacos were among my favorites. Cocktails are smooth and delicious, though I'm not positive about the wine list. Took the recommendation of our waitress and was slightly disappointed with the bottle of white wine she chose, but she kept it coming and our glasses were never empty.Such a great night, and we really felt pampered.

You got me. I can't stay away from the lower east side and its hipster chic hotspots. While visiting NYC a wise coworker (Christy B.) recommended Stanton Social to me. After seeing the yelp hype, including that of Nish who I tend to trust, I hit it up late night on a Friday and was able to grab a spot at the bar.Good music playing and a young stylish crowd was in attendance. Not douche-y at all. :)First up was a peach margarita that the bartender convinced me I had to order. Very strong, with a hint of sweet and a delightful lollipop. Not a bad first pick. I asked what was a must order since they had a lot of tapas, and I was dining solo. Based on the bartender favs I selected the Red Snapper tacos, grilled apple and brie quesadilla, and duck empanadas. All three were utterly amazing. I would for sure bring my foodie husband here next time we're in town.Another tasty cocktail treat was the 1940s champagne julep: like a mint julep with a tasty champagne floater.

Red Snapper tacos, five flavor ribs, the quesadillas, chicken and waffles (Yes! they have chicken and waffles), and more. All these dishes despite their mundane names were full of flavor and texture.

The waiter told us to choose 2 small dishes (left side of the menu) and 2 large dishes (right side of the menu). We ended up choosing 3 small and 2 large --Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies - Amazing!Sweet & Sour Chicken & Cashew Spring Rolls \u00a0- Not bad at allPumpkin And Goat Cheese Croquettes - How can you go wrong with this combination?Chicken & Waffles - Very tasty combination - the balsamic maple syrup is amazing!Kobe Beef Slider (me), Lobster Roll (friend) - Both pretty good, nothing out of this world though.Of course we were hungry after that, so we ordered the chicken sausage pizzetta and some kind of duck confit dumpling. The pizzetta was pretty good but the duck confit was just alright, although the blood orange sauce was tasty. Oh, we also had drinks at the beginning of the meal - just \u00a0a few of the house cocktails, which were extremely small and expensive so we stayed away from those. Dessert was the apple pie sundae (my friend doesn't like chocolate!) and that was good and definitely plenty to share.The only thing I didn't like was that the bill was $70 per person. But ah, probably won't be back there anytime soon, at least until I save up some more money :-P. I would say that it was worth the money - a lot of fun sharing different dishes and the service was good too.", "Date": "2008-01-29", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Randi H.", "ReviewID": "P3KO1Gvg-fVVnIspJk3NNg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upon first glance I thought this place seemed like a typical Manhattan place...overpriced, so-so food, pretentious crowd. Let's just say I couldn't have been more wrong.Met some friends here for dinner on a Friday night around 9. It was full, but didn't feel overly packed. Everyone was really nice (hostess, coat check lady, a bartender and our waitress) and suprisingly friendly and made our experience really fun. The atmosphere was great - mood lighting, big wooden tables, overly large chairs. More formal downstairs, more loungish upstairs.I would definitely recommend starting with a fun cocktail - they weren't too expensive and all the ones we sampled were delicious and unique. The tapas menu was extensive - for 4 of us we split 10 choices. We were satisfied by course 8, definitely full by 10. I would recommend listening to the waitress when they recommend how many entrees to pick for the number of people you have! \u00a0The service was quick but not rushed, and they only give you one plate at a time so you never really just sit there waiting. The busboys were great at giving fresh plates & making sure your table was clear too which was a plus.Personally, I loved the menu selections - everything is a twist on a classic. Some of my favorite twists were (with amazing ingredients): Wings, PBJ, french onion soup, grilled cheese, fish and chips, etc all made with really high end ingredients (a \"quesadilla\" with goat cheese, apples, truffle oil, etc). \u00a0I felt like I was on Top Chef sampling their creations.

Very dimly-lit, contemporarily styled, loud as hell, and filled with a melting pot of young professionals and Euro-trash foreigners.I went with a friend around 8pm on a Wednesday and it was a 45 minute wait (or so the hostess said). So instead of going to the main room, we decided to head upstairs to the bar/lounge area, which was much smaller but definitely had the same vibe. After getting a couple drinks at the bar (and over an hour later), we realize that the hostess still hasn't called us and after talking to her, it seemed like we had to wait another 30 minutes. What happened to the original 45 mins? I hate when restaurants do that.Anyways, so because we're impatient, we just ate at the bar, which still serves the full menu. We got the: (1) Kobe beef sliders, (2) French onion soup dumplings, (3) Flank steak and tater tots, (4) Chicken wings, and (5) French fries. The kobe beef sliders were awesome -- very flavorful and the meat tasted really fresh. I also loved the french onion soup dumplings -- very unique dish (I've never had anything like this before) where there's 6 holes on a plate and each hole holds a dumpling that's soaked in french onion soup. Only wish the cheese on top didn't dry up so fast. But otherwise, it was delicious.I wasn't too impressed with their flank steak and tater tots. I felt like the steak was a bit tougher than I expected and the tater tots had the texture of liver. The flavor wasn't that great either. The chicken wings were good, but nothing worth recommending. The fries were decent -- probably a little too overpriced for what it was though.So yeah, definitely the food was a hit or miss. Each dish is small, but I didn't find it to be as overpriced as everyone says (granted you stick with the good dishes). I mean I would definitely pay $7 for those kobe beef sliders.What I did like about this place, though, are the drinks. Very experienced, skilled bartenders who make awesome drinks. They're all really personable and professional, so I was really impressed with that. Initially, I would have expected them to be douchebags, but I'm glad to see they aren't.All in all, I have mixed feelings about Stanton Social. Great ambiance, nice NYC vibe, with awesome drinks and some phenomenal dishes.

Unfortunately I don't think everyone else that was at the restaurant got the hint that the restaurant was a little less casual than a TGI Fridays...That got me a little irritated. It's always great to see people in a t-shirt and sweats, or whatever the case may be, at a place like the Stanton Social.Nevertheless, as I was distracted by the casual diners, I also was distracted by the fact that the food was just average. The menu definitely was great for vegetarians, but it didn't have that wow factor I thought it would. We had the gnocchi, asparagus, sliders and some other dishes, finishing off with the massive chocolate plate. My bf seems to think the best thing we had that night was the variety chocolate plate, I disagree, but, whatever. I like the ambiance of the place, however, if you're looking to have a chat with the people you're dining with, that might be tough. It can get loud and it is dark, but that's not too bad.

One member of the party was 10 mins late, but we were not seated for another 30 minutes, despite a table of 8 being empty. It was broken down to accommodate other guests just after our last friend arrived (we watched as our full party was present). I found it completely unacceptable since we clearly had reservations and were told to wait at the bar. But we were NEVER informed that our table was being given away until we re-approached the hostess ourselves, and found out the empty table we were staring at was supposed to be ours. I've found a 5-10 min grace period common with other places in the city, so I'm not clear why this place would be an exception. Not to mention the hostess was clearly snide and made no attempt to be apologetic or even feign an attempt at helping us.We were waiting around in the crowded coat check area 45 mins after our original reservation time, and finally escorted to a tiny booth that typically accommodates 6, and asked to squeeze in. (Yes, many of my friends and I are small, but we are still adults, and it felt quite insulting!) One of my friends was seated by the hostess in the aisle, blocking the poor waiters the whole night.The food was passable, but definitely not as hyped. The french onion soup dumpling were way too salty. Tacos small, pretty tasty but not satisfying. A few other forgettable dishes. I'll just conclude by saying the table next to us was a group of high school girls celebrating some event or another and I realized that reflected the entire experience.

Im not usually a fan of the EV but I had wanted to try the Meatball Shop for some time. We showed up at 830 on a Sunday night and to my dismay at the the time there was a 90 minute wait.... So i pulled out my handy Yelp app on my phone and searched for near by restaurants. As I scrolled down the list I saw Stanton Social. I had heard of the SS before, but didnt know anything about it.I was immediately impressed with the decor and ambiance of SS. When I spoke to the hostess she asked if we had a reservation, we didnt, but they sat us immediately in the dinning room. Our waiter was rather helpful walking us through the menu and suggesting dishes that sounded amazing. OBetween three people we ended up settling on 7 dishes: Wok Charred Edamame Spicy Miso Glaze (added amazing flavor to a usually bland dish), Warm Piquillo Pepper 'Bruschetta (Stuffed with garlic goat cheese), Red Snapper Tacos (came garnished with a creamy avacado sauce and had a sweet mango glaze), \u00a0Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake 'Corn Dogs' (a simple yet new twist to spice up a boring crab cake), Chipotle Grilled Shrimp (absolutely divine), Grilled Apple & Brie Quesadilla ( stuffed with mustard maple syrup sauce and bacon bits) and finally Old School Meatballs (because I was craving meatballs all day).Although all the dishes were small i felt like I had consumed a 4 course meal! After our meal the waiter came by with the dessert menu. I thought I had nothing left but as soon as I saw the Hot Chocolate Mudslide Shot i knew I could never turn down a shot especially one that came with Patron, Baileys and a homemade marshmallow! Once it hit the table the warm chocolate and tequila warmed my core and got me ready for the rest of the night.The finally bill for the night was $142 that we split three ways. While that might sounds high, the quality of the food was amazing, I didnt feel like I was sitting right on top of the table next to us and was able to enjoy the conversation at the table.

We figure if he's good enough to be a regular judge, then his own restaurant should live up to its popularity. Bottom line: we weren't disappointed (although we were jealous of some of the tables next to us).Spicy Lobster Benedict [$13] -- Overall, delicious. A big, juicy piece of lobster meat on each mini English muffin half with wilted spinach, a quail egg, and chipotle hollandaise. The small spinach salad with a light vinaigrette helped to cut the fattiness of the dish, but was definitely only there for texture. The spice in the hollandaise with the texture of the lobster absolutely made this dish.Croque Monsieur Satays [$9] -- As good as any croque monsieur I've ever tasted (can you go that wrong with ham, gruyere, bechamel, and toast?), but here's the problem: making one huge ooey, gooey, cheesy, melty sandwich into four 1 inch x 1 inch squares (with 3 slices of bread, mind you) didn't make it any better. The flavor was there, but if you're going to put these itty bitty squares on a stick, shouldn't it taste even better than the original? Our advice- if you're craving it, get it. Otherwise, order something more innovative and interesting flavor wise.French Onion Soup Dumplings [$12] -- If you read any of the reviews on Yelp, you'll notice right away that this is one of the Stanton Social's claims to fame. It lives up to its reputation. In the words of Rachael Ray, YUM. O. Nuff said.Kobe Beef Burger/Slider [$7] -- Yes, this was delicious, with some sort of sweet barbecue-like sauce with a little bit of cooked onion, but way too small for $7. Really? One slider? I mean, I know it's Kobe Beef, but even the Cheesecake factory down in Jersey is giving them away for 10 bucks and it's adult sized. Skip this one and try something else on this eclectic menu.Chicken and Waffles [$18] -- So so good... We were hesitant about the balsamic maple drizzle, but the chicken was juicy and the skin was crispy, and the corn waffle underneath was great. There was also what we think was a corn puree underneath the chicken, which had great flavor. \u00a0Our only unfulfilled desire was this: a crispy waffle! It's possible this was done on purpose, but every waffle I've ever had was crispy on the outside and pillow soft on the inside. Worth $18? Probably not, but it's worth trying.If we could have sampled these small, almost tapas like plates ahead of time, we would have nixed the Kobe burger and Croque monsieur satays right away for taste and value. But the 2 tables next to us had the right idea. They had both ordered the Huevos Rancheros [$12] and Red Snapper Tacos [$10]. The smell of these mini tacos wafted their way to our table from both sides (it was almost cruel)- not to mention they both were popular dishes throughout the restaurant. \u00a0The tables next to us seemed VERY happy with their choices. If we come back in the near future, we would try these in addition to the Potato Latkes with sour cream and apple sauce [3 per order for $6] in a heartbeat.We're saving this comment for last because we didn't want it to interfere with your first impression of the food, but it needs to be said. We find that no one on the internet has commented on this, maybe because it's embraced or appreciated? Or maybe because people thought they were imagining it? Or maybe because it's not that big of a deal? But there was... a strong smell of... cheese! \u00a0It's pretty smelly cheese. It's DAMN GOOD, especially in the soup dumplings, but if you're not a super duper cheese lover or you stray away from the cheese counter at Whole Foods because the smell suffocates you, just be prepared. It caught us off guard at first, but it shouldn't interfere with your dining experience.Great space, great atmosphere, and ORDER 5-6 DISHES for 2 people.

Thank god. The upstairs space is really cool, a few small tables for eating, a set of lounges for reclining and gentle lighting courtesy of the skylight and the rustic metal lamps above the bar.We happily settled in, content in the privacy of our thoughts and low key discussion. The bloody marys were good, although were a victim of too much ice and vodka in a short glass, leaving the consistency a little thin and watery.

We tried the french onion soup dumplings that everybody is raving about and I found them to be a bit too salty. That all said, I'm going with 3 stars because the food is not quite good enough to justify the price. Some of the small plates are reasonably priced, but some are $14/$15 for a couple of pieces. Worse still - they charge $3 for a cup of tea or drip coffee!! (and no, it's regular old drip coffee, not Jamaican Blue Mountain or anything like that)Last thing: \"designed for sharing\". This is an obnoxious euphemism I've seen popping up at a lot of places. Dear restaurant owners: unless it comes in a huge bowl and is served with tongs or an enormous spoon, it's not \"designed\" for sharing. This is akin to calling those tiny chocolate bars \"fun sized\". It's all just covering up the fact that these portions are too small to be enjoyed on their own.", "Date": "2010-08-02", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Leah M.", "ReviewID": "3kT4MFO8WV32tdu6pnZOPA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came here with a group of 5, 3 of those people being out-of towners looking for a NY experience...enter SS!I love small plates, love cute boys, love a good cocktail. \u00a0SS gives me all of those things....but.....the food is sooo spendy and not....that.....great.

The food is very good - I'm awful fond of the chef. But the atmosphere often kills it for me. I understand that loungy, Euro-trash vibe brings in a certain kind of clientele, the kind who spend a lot on cocktails trying to impress their dates or each other while pretending to make deals on their annoying little bluetooth earpieces. But I don't want to hear it or be around it, personally.The seating downstairs is fine - normal tables and whatnot - though it's a bit sterile. And in the bar/lounge upstairs (where the \"cool people\" are, I guess) it's just not conducive to eating, but to - well, lounging. Deep-seated couches are never good for dining - it's hard to lean over to the tables. Fine for sipping cocktails and maybe a small bite or two, something to pick at alongside the drinks, but not for a meal.The service could be a little better. It can be tough to get the attention of waitstaff sometimes, and when you do some of them can come off a bit indifferent. I wonder, maybe, if the've just developed hard exteriors from having to deal with the d-bag crowds. Can't say I blame them if they have.The food is good, though, like I said, and by and large price-appropriate. There are a few items that seem to be marked up more than usual, but you'll find that nearly anywhere.

Stanton stands out as one of the new luxe establishments popping up across the formerly grungy areas of the Lower East Side. A bilevel restaurant-bar-lounge, it's sleek and sexy. For our victuals, we ordered the spicy lobster benedict, chicken n' waffles, chicken taquitos, french onion soup dumplings, lamb souvlakis, ricotta fritters, and caramelized banana pancakes. I will start by saying that one must prepare themselves to order a good chunk of the brunch menu if they seek physical fulfillment from Stanton; the portions are quite small. The benedict was delicious (especially the accompanying spinach); the lobster was fresh and perfectly prepared. The chicken n' waffles was just ok; the flavors were all there waiting to let out cries of exuberance that were, unfortunately, stifled by the lack of texture as both the chicken and the waffle were far too soggy. The \"taquitos\" should be renamed to \"one long taquito.\" I thought it was far too ridiculous what Stanton charges for something that could be put in the microwave and cut up into five bits to be shared. Admittedly, the flavors were better than a market brand alternative, but for $12 I think it would have been only far to AT LEAST serve two taquitos to make the dish worthy of its name. The dumplings were amazing and I'm not even a huge fan of french onion soup; the deliciously moist bread dumpling mixed with the sweetness of the broth and the savory cheese globs makes this dish a decadent luxury. The lamb souvlaki was the star of the meal; though one of the more simpler dishes that Stanton offers, it is one of THE best plates of lamb I have ever had. For our \"dessert,\" we enjoyed the zesty lemon-flavored ricotta fritters which, although tasty, were a bit more battered than expected. The pancakes were also delicious, especially when you consume them with the candied blackberries that join the flapjacks!

We came here at 6pm on a Friday night which was good because it was not crowded and previous reviews have mentioned that tables of 2 are usually on top of each other. We left at about 7:30 and the restaurant was beginning to fill up. So come here early!The waitress was nice and helpful. She asked if it was our first time there and let us know that they recommend 2-3 plates per person. A bus boy then came with a complementary tasting of the caesar salad bites. A single, minuscule bite of caesar salad sandwiched between 2 circular pieces of crouton. If this was ever offered on the full menu, it'd be the biggest rip off ever! But we appreciated the free tasting because who doesn't love free stuff??We ordered to french onion soup dumplings, crab cake corn dogs, thai baby back ribs, and the red snapper tacos. Despite all the talk about the soup dumplings, they were just ALRIGHT. I was expecting more \"soup\" in them, like with xiao long baos. The star of the show were the red snapper tacos (each consisting of about 1.5 bites) but were absolutely amazing! The thai baby back ribs were surprisingly yummy. The meat was falling off the bone and extremely tender and juicy. The crab cake corn dogs sounded very innovative but upon tasting, the flavors were not as interested as they sounded. So my recommendations - red snapper fish tacos and thai baby back ribs!!! We ordered the warm doughnuts for dessert. These sugar coated fried doughs of perfection came 6 to an order, and with chocolate, raspberry and caramel dipping sauces. An excellent way to end your meal :]The meal was $120 including tip for 2 drinks, 4 plates, 1 dessert and 2 dessert shots.

Lets just start it off with the fact that EVERYTHIGN was good and full of flavor. While the kobe beef burger was good, it didn't wow me as much as everything else and I'd recommend passing on this and getting something else. The pulled pork was a little better and served on a biscuit. The one thing that was absolutely the best was the nori tuna. It was the BEST tuna I've ever had and just thinking about it makes my mouth water. This is a MUST have and the next time I go, I'm ordering two. You don't taste it right away, but after that first bite, it all makes sense. Top notch tuna that I would die for.The service was great and I have no complaints with that.

I was thinking this might be actual french onion soup with dumplings in it, but instead the dish consisted of several dumplings smothered in onions and cheese on toothpicks. Interesting concept and not bad in execution, but I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to eat this again.Red Snapper Tacos: Incredible. Three tiny tacos with so much flavour packed into them. I could've eaten three more plates of these.Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies: Pretty good, but too heavy on the cream. Not sure why it's considered one of their signature dishes.Grilled Pizzetta: We technically didn't order this. We meant to order the bruschetta, but they brought this out to us instead, and we didn't realise it until we got our check (although I did wonder the whole time while our bruschetta was more like flatbread).

I was looking forward most to the soup dumplings (of course) but I thought that it was too doughy. But I think making french onion soup into a dumpling is a genius idea.I'm such a sucker for the Food Network, its embarrassing.

Not worthwhile (this place isn't grimy enough to serve REAL chicken & waffles. Gotta go to LA for that). The drinks and atmosphere bring this place up another notch. The Social Tea is deceivingly delicious, and I was drunk by my 2nd one (disclaimer: lightweight). The people here are pretty but not snooty, and the aura is fun without trying too hard.

So airy and wen so well with the caramel and raspberry sauces. Drinks were pretty good - probably sounded better on paper than they tasted though.

By far both of us favored this plate!!- Baby spinach salad: Very enjoyable dish... the corn must have had a little bit of chili powder because there was a bit of a kick to it... very tasty!- Red snapper tacos: Neither of us had tried red snapper before.. was good, but a bit fishy for both of our tastes. - Pizzetta: Very good; tasted like bruschetta on flat bread... fairly standard. Small wine menu, but the pinot grigiot was very good (and dry).The dislikes: VERY loud atmosphere.... you need to speak up a bit to hear over the loud music... and the 2-seater tables were very close together so you can hear other tables' conversations.On the whole, would definitely return for another meal....

Since the boyfriend made the reservation online, he had let the restaurant know I'm advance it was our anniversary...we surprised and pleased that the manager came out with 2 flutes of champagne and congratulated us. So enough of the back story and sappy crap,on to the main reason I'm writing this, the food lol. :pWe received our free Caesar Salad bites that we gobbled up instantly. I was tempted to see if we could order those because they were refreshingly yummy, and I normally don't like Caesar salads.The rest of the meal:French Onion soup dumplings aka \"little pockets of mouth happiness\": The large amount of hype was true. These ARE a must to order. Granted, my excitement to try the dumplings nearly had me burn my mouth because of the hot, tasty, burgundy brothed onion soup (yea, I do know how to eat soup dumplings..I had a hard time slurping the broth so I slowly bit into it...um dumb move on my part) so..pro-tip: Hot onion soup balls in your mouth all at once =BAD. Eat with tasty caution.Grilled Cheese Sliders: YUCK, do not want. The lemon and green tomato aioli was gross..add cilantro to the mix and you have a icky combination with what could have been good if they stuck with just the plain aged cheddar and jalapeno bacon. It tasted slimy, gooey (in a non good way) and gross. We ended up picking out the bacon and eating it separately.RI Lobster Roll: I'm from Rhode Island...I know Lobster Rolls. It tasted like a regular lobster roll to me minus overly mayoed ickness some lobster rolls are. It was good..not sure if it means the Lobster is from Rhode Island or they picked Rhode Island because it's the coolest state in New England lol. Chicken 'n Waffles: My new moto is Balsamic Maple Syrup makes everything better! The cheddar waffle was a little soggy from too much corn pudding and syrup, but it was edible and tasty. The corn pudding was creamy and sweet. The rosemary pressed chicken was juicy, tender, and flavorful. Overall, I liked it.The Stanton Social Beef Wellington: Ah, the 2nd main reason I chose Stanton Social as my anniversary dinner location. I'm a Hell's Kitchen fan and after years of listening to Gordon Ramsay scream at aspiring head chefs for f****ing up Beef Wellingtons, I have always had an interest of eating one.The filet was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth along with the foie gras \u00a0mushroom filling. The pastry was golden brown and flaky and everything was tied together with a delicious red wine reduction glaze. Love, Love Love...best dish of the night.Honey Glazed and Rosemary Parsnips: They were good..nothing to write home about. It's a basic side dish to me.Hot Chocolate shots: Mmmm....rich hot chocolate with Patron, Bailey's and homemade marshmallow. I had 2..I should have had more.Apple Pie Sundae: It tasted like the apples were brandied..mixed with caramel, it was a great take on a classic. It was creamy sticky apple goodness.Red Velvet Twinkie:...a very sad disappointment due to dry cake. Dry cake is yucky. The creme fraiche filling was perfect, but ruined by dry, tasteless red velvet cake. If the cake was moist and had some flavor, it would have been perfect.I defiantly would come back to try other things I wanted to try on \u00a0the menu and eat the things I gave good reviews for. My advice is make reservations if you go on a Saturday because this place gets slammed fast. Avoid the Twinkies and Grilled Cheese Sliders. Dry cake is yucky cake and some things can ruin a good grilled cheese.3 out of 5 stars: The red velvet twinkie massacre and slimy grilled cheese slider killed 2 stars. The service was good, not outstanding, but good. The manager was very pleasant. :) I won't write The Stanton Social off though..I mean this is my first visit and I had some very amazing tasty things.

Deciding where to go can be difficult, tastebuds can vary, but Stanton Social is one place where you can whet your appetite with a varied selection of tapas. The scene is small and cozy, tables slightly squished, decor is classy and hip. White painted brick walls, half-circled booth tables, dark wood-lacquered furniture, black tablecloth napkins. It's a great place to celebrate with a group of friends. If your group is large enough, there is a private room that you can reserve.I recently celebrated my surprise birthday party here. And I was treated to a very tasty selection of dishes:- Warm Doughnuts - These warm doughnuts were served fresh without a hint of staleness to it. Biting into all that airy and sugary goodness was delicious, but the caramel dipping sauce definitely heightened the sweet flavor just enough to make it a very enjoyable dish. - Croque Monsieur 'Satays' - definitely one of the better dishes of the bunch, maybe even my favorite. Inside these little bite-sized brioche bites were country ham, gruyere and meunster cheese, each served on a toothpick. It was almost like a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich, cheese nice and melty, ham warm and salty along with a subtle crunchy bread. Yum!- Potato Latkes with sour cream and apple sauce - These little fried fritters were crispy on the outside, potatoey on the inside. It was perfectly fried at the right temperature so oil was not absorbed into it. Light and flavorful with a healthy dollop of sour cream sauce and apple sauce made it almost refreshing. Fried food refreshing? Go figure, but definitely a crowd pleaser. It sort of reminds me of a tater tot.- Huevos Rancheros Soft Tacos - scrambled chorizo & eggs, black beans, 'salsa fresca', aged cheddar. It was a solid taco but fell short of amazing. It made for some sloppy eating as the ingredients kept falling out. There was a little too much egg in each taco, which overpowered the scant portions of chorizo. It could have also used some more salsa to give it a refreshing flavor. But, overall, an enjoyable dish but probably one of my least favorites.- Kobe Beef Burgers - These bite-sized slider type burgers filled with a plump and juicy kobe beef patty. Very pink on the inside cooked to about medium-rare, topped with a melty cheese (that I cannot recall). The bread bun was slightly buttered, making for a very tasty beef burger that I wouldn't mind eating a few of these. The side of salt & vinegar chips definitely helped to give the burger some crunchy texture.- Chicken n' Waffles - brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle, corn pudding, and balsamic spiked maple syrup. I wasn't too particularly fond of this dish, maybe because this was the last dish and my stomach was about to burst. The white meat chicken was tender though could have been juicier by using the darker meat variation. The waffle was subpar, not really adding much to the dish, making it feel more like an afterthought, rather than a compliment to the chicken and sweet syrup.Stanton Social does, for the most part, serve some delicious dishes. The ambiance and good food make for a very enjoyable dining experience.

First let me start with the french onion dumpling sound. The cheese is gooey and melty and delicious. The soup itself comes out extremely hot, and the flavor is out of this world. Just perfectly seasoned, and absolutely mouth watering! The second favorite is the The Stanton Social Beef Wellington - HOLY WOW! The fois \u00a0gras mousse (I'm sure it was a mousse) with delicious mushrooms all surrounded by a delicious pastry make me want to book a flight just for dinner here.The sliders are all delicious. I love the lobster roll, and of course the kobe slider was to die for. For starters we always have the edamame, beef carpaccio, the sashimi of choice that week. Always amazing, and they do a really good time split between the apps and main dishes. I appreciate that attention to detail.

We ordered:Warm piquillo pepper bruschetta- comes with roasted garlic goat cheese. It's INCREDIBLY creamy, so it's good that they only served it in small quantities, which also keeps you wanting more. Taste: 4/5Red snapper tacos- comes with avocado and spicy mango. One of my personal favorites out of everything that I ordered! Too bad the portions are only bite sized! Taste: 5/5 French onion soup dumplings- also one of my favorites! there's a REASON why all the other yelpers have recommended this! It's smothered with cheese all over the top; definitely not like your average dumpling in which all the goodies are wrapped on the inside. Advice: eat the dumpling WHOLE. That way you can get a taste of all the juices inside, which is one of the best part! Taste: 5/5.Butternut squash and sweet potato ravioli- topped with vanilla brown butter and candied pecans, so don't be fooled, this ravioli is SWEET! More like a warm dessert rather than a savory dinner-type dish. Probably a reason why they served this dish last. Taste: 3/5.Foie gras- on top of toasted brioche topped with pistachios and spiced kumquat jam. I would have liked it better withOUT the kumquat jam. The tangy zing from the jam tasted like sweet, sour orange peels. But on top of my savory foie gras, it just didn't go well together. I praise their creativity and boldness, but taste: 3/5.Crabcake slider- with BBQed onion & mango slaw. The onion taste may have been a bit overbearing on the crabcake, but overall taste: 4/5Lobster roll- like a hot dog but instead of a wiener in the middle, you have savory bits of lobster in creamy form. Okok, ALSO one of my favorites. Taste: 5/5. \u00a0Note: these dishes ranged from $7-$14 each. Super pricey!Lastly, if you like fruity drinks, definitely get the pineapple martini! In fact, all their drinks are beautifully made. I could understand why they were $13 each!The service wasn't incredibly good. The waiter lacked eye contact, as if his mind was always elsewhere.

The rest was good, but not sure if I would be willing to pay the price for it without the deal. The famed French Onion Soup Dumplings were not that soupy. I was expecting it to be Asian dumplings style. But the gruyere on top was yummy. For brunch, we were recommended the banana pancakes, which were delicious. I also loved the lobster benedict, which had a huge chunk of lobster. They did not skimp. \u00a0Attire is fairly casual and the ambiance is laid back. You would feel comfortable here in jeans. Just like with Beauty and Essex, they are REALLY quick with bussing the tables. I guess this moves the diners along more? For brunch we got seated by the bar area in the highest floor, which was great because that is really the only part of the restaurant that gets good light, and the day we went was a beautiful day. Not my favorite brunch space but will recommend as a fun place to try for brunch if you're feeling like small plates.", "Date": "2012-05-07", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Gloria K.", "ReviewID": "mMvu_IASG8Ecm7BxhtvK6Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Def a hot spot.Stanton Teas, Chicken and Waffles, and pretty people.", "Date": "2012-09-09", "Author_Location": "Fairfield County, CT"}, {"Author": "Emilia L.", "ReviewID": "o-Eh9lTXAZWjU5Dwkj4QsQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A friend recommended this tapas restaurant for dinner, so I made reservations for us for my birthday dinner. We arrived a bit early for the 7:15 reservation and were promptly seated upstairs, near the bar area. The server recommended we choose about two dishes per person, but we stuck with five because six or seven dishes would have been way too much.We got:- Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies: caramelized onions, truffle creme fraiche ($9)- Ahi Tuna Poke: crispy wonton, avocado, fresno chili ($15)- Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas: jalapeno salsa verde ($10)- Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake 'Corn Dogs' ($13)- 'Chicken n' Waffles': brick pressed chicken, aged cheddar waffle, corn pudding, balsamic spiked maple syrup ($19)The pierogies were deep fried, which was interesting. I thought pierogies are normally boiled potato dumplings. I loved it though. The ahi tuna poke was also delicious. Little mounds of tuna tartare placed upon wonton chips with a slice of chili pepper and a bit of avocado to glue the morsel to the plate. The arepas were also good, though tricky to eat. There was a pile of hand pulled chicken on each arepa, so I essentially started eating half the chicken by itself so the pile wasn't so high. The crabcake corn dogs were probably my least favorite. I didn't see anything that special about them and the corn meal covering was soft and not crispy like a traditional corn dog. The chicken n' waffles were good, though that was my second to least favorite. The chicken alone was not that flavorful -- you definitely needed to coat it a bit with the balsamic syrup. The waffle definitely had the corn taste, but I didn't get too much aged cheddar from it. Service was incredibly fast. I think we were in and out of the place in 35 minutes. Pretty impressive for a restaurant like that. I later found out that we were part of the early dining crew.

I know. 2 out of the 8 tapas are actually worth commending.Warm Piquillo Pepper 'Bruschetta' stuffed with roasted garlic-goat cheese $7. Two pieces of sad bread. Sad? The foundation of Bruschetta (to me) comes from quality bread with great texture and density. Plus, a crunchy bite. It was dabbled with garlic-goat cheese and whole roasted red pepper. My taste buds weren't dazzled from the combination.Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies with caramelized onions & truffle creme fraiche $9. This dish consist of three pierogies that was recommended by our server. A fried outer shelf filled with creamy cheese. I enjoyed this and was content. And I'm not big on pierogies.Beef Carpaccio- pickled shallot, fried capers, wholegrain mustard-cr\u00e8me fraiche $13. Thinly sliced beef and overly salted. Pickled shallot, capers and sea salt; all in one dish is asking for your blood pressure to please go up higher. Nevertheless it was nicely presently, and the plate was cleaned up in minutes.Sweet & Sour Chicken & Cashew Spring Rolls $9. Four rolls for 9 bucks, REALLY? Not the most memorable and least tastiest. Served piping hot, wrappers weren't as crunchy as I would liked and filling was not bold as I hoped. Sprinkled with lots of bits of cashews.Nori Spiced Tuna Tartare Roll $13. Can you go wrong with Tartare? Nicely executed dish. Seasoned tuna wrapped in a light crispy nori. Enjoyable.Social Mac & Cheese - chorizo, ovendried tomato $12. Literally a serving cup of mac and cheese. Nicely plated. Well done crusty cheese and creamy cheese center. But not for $12. That's just robbery.Grilled Ovendried Tomato Pizzetta fresh mozzarella, grana, roasted garlic, chile oil $14. The most expensive tapas and biggest dish turned out to be the most ridiculously disappointing. Mama Celeste will be so proud, she might jump out of the box and kill this dish. The Pizzetta has an ultra thin crust without the consistency of a pizza dough but very similar to a large stale cracker. The toppings didn't shine, with mediocre ingredients. For me, pizza is about the dough and fresh ingredients. Neither were executed properly. Thumbs down. Super down.Rhode Island Style Lobster Roll $9. One lobster roll, and the server makes it very clear. Miniature bun in refreshing blend of celery and spices. (If you're willing to dish a little more money out for a lobster roll, I recommend Pearl Oyster Bar, yes its pricey but if you got yourself a couple more of these minis, it'd cost you more and be a big mistake. Trust me.Out of respect for food blogging, I mentioned all 8. There are many more dishes on the menu. I'm sure there are great ones but in conclusion I'd opt out on this place if I was famished and impatient. I am most of the time. These are tapas, so definitely don't hope to be stuffed if you're willing to pay a big premium. Very Appropriate to go with friends to catch up and have drinks and people watch. If you don't mind the crowd and noise, give this a try. Decor is invitingly trendy and busy.After dinner, we had to stop at a Thai restaurant for some more grub...

My husband & I along with 2 other couples, came here about 3-4 weeks ago over Labor Day weekend. We had been trying to get reservations for weeks & figured on a slower NYC weekend, while everyone was out of town, we would be able to get a table. We had 10pm reservations. We arrived at 9:45pm. Our party was 2 people short than the original reservation. When we originally called the day before to book a table, we were told it would be better to say we were more people as it is easier to remove people from a table than add. When I arrived, I let the male host know that our party was here in full & we were two people short. Prior to my arrival, our friend also let him know we would be 2 short. We were told to go upstairs to the bar & the table would be ready shortly & someone would come get us. About 45 minutes later, my husband went downstairs to see why we had not been seated. We were told that we never checked in so they gave our table away. When I came downstairs see what was going on & the host realized I did check in he said we were not here in full so they were waiting for the other 2 people to arrive. He had a very bad attitude, basically making us feel like we were nobody special & since this is the \"it\" restaurant of the moment, he didn't care. After a little bit of arguing, he told us our table would be ready soon. Another 30 minutes passed with no table. Finally another hostess came out to seat us apologizing for the mess & as soon as we were seated, a manager came over with 2 appetizers for us to eat - she apologized for the miscommunication & said she could imagine how hungry we were. We were squeezed into a table that was obviously meant for 4 people, even though we were 6. The restaurant was insanely packed & the tables are so close together that the waiters have to maneuver through the chairs to serve each table. We ordered about 10 different dishes off the menu along with drinks. The food was okay. Nothing FANTASTIC. Our friends & I travel to the city frequently to dine at all types of restaurants.

The ambiance was cute, although the tables were WAY too close together, as was proven by the woman sliding in beside me who spilled a drink that was on the table to the other side of her. Our waitress was lovely, helpful and attentive. She had suggestions and recommendations so that was nice. However, several times when others would come by they poured water with such urgency that it spilled all over our food, and they dropped plates so quickly they almost slid off the table.

We also had the Red Snapper Tacos which were very fresh. The Baby Spinach Salad was a nice zesty break in our meal. It was a good portion and easy to split. The salad had little pieces of corn to make it sweeter. Lastly, the Hudson Valley Foie Gras came out. I really like Foie Gras, so these bite sized morsels left me wanting more. To finish off a nice meal, we ordered the warm doughnuts with various dipping sauce. These were a nice touch, as they were warm, soft, and sugary without being too sweet.

The variety of tapas at this place is great and the portion sizes are just perfect for 2 people to try 4-5 tapas and still have some room left for the desert (you will have to hit the gym the next day). The Arepas and the Beef burger were my fav but the others were really good too. \u00a0 The desert: We had the warm doughnuts that come with 3 types of sauces - the doughnuts were warm and fluffy (yum).

I'm a huge Food Network fan and picked this restaurant after watching Chris Santos as a judge on Chopped. Checked out the menu before hand and was pretty stoked! I was really anticipating a different atmosphere though, and that was a big push on knocking my review down to a three star. Here's the breakdown:Food: Was absolutely delicious. We got quite a spread - the pierogies, french onion dumplings, sashimi, quesadillas, bruschetta, snapper tacos, mac n cheese, philly slider, kobe beef slider, pulled pork slider, donuts, red velvet twinkie, and milkshake shot. Favorites: pierogies, french onion dumplings, and philly slider. I would pass on the red velvet twinkie, bruschetta, and fish tacos. They weren't bad, but to me they just weren't as great as the other choices. Booze: Skip the wine - the pours seemed so small - not worth $12. Get a beer instead, or if you're going to spend $12, get a cocktail, I'm sure it's a better value.Atmosphere: Holy smokes - the other reviews weren't kidding when they said it was loud in there. I thought people were exaggerating, but oh boy they weren't. It was difficult to maintain a conversation without practically yelling at each other. I felt very out of place for the crowd that was there. I feel like the population was mostly 20s and 30s, which is okay there, but it felt like one huge glorified cocktail party and such a big party scene. I'm not saying that's bad - I just wasn't expecting it for this restaurant, and it didn't match the experience I was having with my food.Service: We had an 11pm reservation, got seated about 11:10pm, so not too bad. Our server was friendly - nothing memorable, but we got our food in a timely manner.Would I go back - with all of the choices for incredible food in NYC, I would say not by first choice.

French Onion is one of the greatest things ever created, so to imagine it in a dumpling - what could be better?!?!Since 2010 I have waited patiently, so very very patiently for these dumplings and finally this past February I had the chance to go and finally taste this culinary delight. Of course I also sampled other offerings as well. Since it is tapas style, you can easily order many different items and sample small bits with friends, and boy oh boy did we ever. Some of the highlights of our meal was the kobe slider, short rib tacos, obviously the french onion dumplings and beef wellington. The slider - perfectly juicy - out of the park, enough said - try it. The short rib tacos - the short ribs were so tender and well sauced and I loved every bite. The French Onion dumplings - HOLY COW!!! talk about a perfect bite. The onion was sweet, the cheese perfectly tangy and amazing, and then theres the crouton - just thinking about it gives me fond memories. The beef wellington was also wonderful, so wonderful we ordered a second one afterwards. The crust was perfectly crusty and the meat very tender and nice and pink inside just the way I like it.Dessert was not quite up to the same caliber as the meal, but still quite good. We had a cookie platter, the guiness cake, and so many other things that I can't keep track cause our table was so full!

Our waiter was attentive at first, graciously taking our drink and then our dinner orders. However, once the food started arriving, he was nowhere to be found. We wanted another round of drinks and to order an additional dish (after seeing it served to the table next to us). We had to ask another waiter to flag him down. When we wanted to order dessert, our waiter was again nowhere to be found. Another waiter ended up giving us dessert menus and our waiter seemed reluctant to take our dessert orders. He was, however, very prompt with dropping off the check (before we even asked for it). He dropped it off immediately after our dessert came (before we could even take a bite of it). He came back several times while we were eating out dessert to check to see if we had looked at the check yet. He was very obvious he wanted to turn over the table even though we had only been there for an hour at that point. One of the busboys started taking our drinks away even though we were not finished with them yet, and we had to tell him to put them back. The host even came over to tell us he needed the table. The behavior of the staff was not very tasteful and completely unexpected for a meal at $75 a person.I was very displeased with being treated in such a manner....", "Date": "2013-12-19", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Justin K.", "ReviewID": "lKOGbzdq9S9R3qdildHwGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in the city.

It had been bookmarked on my To Try list ever since I had moved to NY. Praised as one of the hot spots with its unique small plates creations, delicious cocktails and beautiful decor, I was eager to soak it all in.I finally made reservations for myself and three of my girlfriends on a Tuesday night. We didn't want to deal with waiting for a table so we made the reservation for 7pm. Having worked close by, N. and I got there early and we were directed to their upstairs bar where we assumed we would wait until the rest of our party arrived. The upstairs dining area isn't nearly as nice as the downstairs so if possible, try to get a table downstairs! We decided to order some cocktails at the bar while we waited. We decided on the Manhattan sidecar and the Basil lime gimlet. Low and behold, they were hardly memorable. The bartender barely spent any time making the drinks. I guess I was expecting a drink that is over $12 to be made with a lil more TLC. Should I ever go back, I'll stick with the beer and wine. We ended up being seated upstairs. Ugh. Perhaps that added to our average experience. So on to the food. One of my friends had heard a lot about their french onion soup dumplings which sounded very interesting. The server suggested that we each choose 2 items in order to be satisfied. A few of us were still skeptical about the food so we told him we would each order one item first. I think he was a little offended but still graciously accepted the fact that we had disregarded his recommendation. We ordered the french onion soup dumplings, grilled apple and brie quesadilla, Hudson valley foie gras and the potato and goat cheese pierogies. The only thing we fully enjoyed were the pierogies but that was mostly due to the truffle creme fraiche. You really can't screw up a dish when you have creme fraiche that tastes like truffles. I literally covered my pierogi in the heavenly creme and would have done the same with all the other items but one of the servers came and whisked it away when it looked empty. Clearly, he did not understand the joys of life. The presentation of the french onion soup dumplings was very clever. I appreciated that much. They were placed in a bowl similar to the ones used to present escargot but in this case, the entire top of the bowl was covered in stinky gruyere cheese. I think it was gruyere, since that is the cheese typically found in french onion soup. Anyway, one of my girlfriends thought it smelled awful and looked very annoyed. *shrug* The rest of us being cheese lovers, we made sure that was all out of her sight in no time. The soup dumplings themselves were nothing fantastic. I think it was more of a concept that sounds ingenious but once executed, falls short of expectations. And the foie gras? The foie gras tasted like butter. Not quite the taste I had in mind and probably would never order it here again. Do I need to talk about the quesadilla? It's a frikken quesadilla. We all know what that tastes like. Sadly, none of us were excited to order a second round of plates. We all sat there staring at the menu for what seemed like eternity (the server came by twice). Finally, after a lot of beating around the bush, we all agreed that we were no longer hungry and asked the poor server for the check. The plus side was that I was expecting to spend $$$$ on dinner but ended up only spending $15 haha I guess that is a good feeling...Note:: Why does it say that Stanton Social has a happy hour? I asked a server if they indeed do have HH and she replied in the negative.", "Date": "2012-09-08", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Aaron M.

All caveats and tomfoolery aside, we ordered french onion soup dumplings which I'd actually had someplace else - maybe WD50 but these were phenomenal.

Next was the duck salad. Delicious smoked duck and outstanding kale. Very good salad. The pirogues are also phenomenal and a great dish to start with. I liked the fish tacos and thai ribs but they weren't \u00a0my favorite. Lastly, I got the Spaghetti Carbonara with quail egg and pork belly that was outta control good.

We were 4 people in the table. The couple in front of us, lets say \"Ari\" \u00a0and \"Suzie\" ordered 2 drinks and the Grilled Pizzetta which I didn't try but that smelled delicious and it didn't produce other that a pleasant gesture on them. Suzie and Ari were trying to find out if we were having a second date, since they could detect high attraction and certain seduction game (Ari), or a third date (Suzie) since it looked to her that there was also a lot of confidence and complicity between us, a sign of more frequent encounters. \"I think they have even been together for 1 month already\" is what she said when we all were talking about it a bit later. Yes, I met Suzie and Ari that night at the table since they were seated there right after us .. and we socialize with them and we had a pleasant and funny conversation about gender differences and in fact a correspondence between each one ideas and gender; with me being agree with Suzie and my friend being agree with Ari. That you will be seated with others at the same table looks to be the regular behaviour at Stanton Social since it happen to me a few months later when I was back with a friend, a girl this time, to have again a drink since I liked the ones that I had that day back when I met Ari and Suzie . If you like this or not depends of different factors; you, your mood, who is your companion, how are the others (remember that you don't choose them.. they are imposed). \u00a0I have to say that I liked both times. Even the first one; it was really funny. \u00a0You can always stay in the bar area, tho; which it was my intention the second time but we couldn't get an spot. \u00a0The crowd at Stanton Social was in a range from middle twenties to late thirties; it was older during the week. It was always nice and is easy to socialize if you want. Either the hostess, which I never could find out her name, as well as Nikki, our waitress was extremely nice and professionals. Designed by AvroKo, the team that some of you already know I'm crazy about, you can't other than expect a beautiful space. Stanton Social is sexy, trendy, soft lights but not dark, more like glowing in gold, with botanical painted in the walls, and leather sofas. The tables can easily accommodate groups of 6 to 8 people. There is groups of female/male friends playing gender games. Its also a place to bring a date. The drinks menu offer from wines to cocktails that was always my selection. The combinations are interesting. Among the ones that I tried, I highly recommend the Pineapple 75 Martini and mostly the Basil-Lime Gimlet a mix of \u00a0Belvedere vodka, muddled basil leaves, lemon syrup and fresh lime juice. I also tried the Cranberry Flower and the Bea's Gin-Lemon Mojito. It wasn't as good but still I enjoyed it as well. Fresh ingredients/herbs is a characteristic in all the drinks. Said this and having clear that I enjoyed the ambiance, somehow I'm not very excited about the place. Its loud, the music wasn't very good, not bad either, and I didn't feel like socializing with the groups I saw. But it could be that particular night. Also, they are too generous with the ice in the drinks and so it gets cold and the flavor gets diluted soon which I really don't like. But still; if I'm in the area I'll definitely come back. And I'll order again the Basil-Lime Gimlet. I still remember the scents of the fresh basil. I also wanna try the food at the restaurant, downstairs.

Onion. Soup. Dumplings. \u00a0Yes, that's right. \u00a0A traditional Asian-style dumpling filled with deeply caramelized onions fortified with stock and seasonings to taste like soup without being overly brothy (that would make it much more difficult to eat). \u00a0These dumplings are served in an escargots dish, topped with melted Gruyere cheese and skewered with croutons. \u00a0It's the complete French onion soup experience in the form of a dumpling! \u00a0This is the main reason for going to The Stanton Social. \u00a0But let me share a few more reasons... It's fun and hip, in the too-cool-for-school Lower East Side. \u00a0I hear it's great for birthdays and bachelorette parties, and I can totally see why! \u00a0It's hard to find (no big sign), which means it must be good, right? \u00a0It has a room filled with vodka bottles, and lots of other fun alcohol bottles in the upstairs dining area lining the walls. \u00a0Service was impeccable, our empty dishes were cleared almost instantly, making room for more food! \u00a0Our waiter was cute. \u00a0Very cute ;-) The other foods we ate were delicious too, and so were our drinks! \u00a0I honestly think I may plan my next birthday here :)The Stanton Social features small plates intended for sharing, much like tapas. \u00a0I appreciate the variety, as I get to eat many different things. \u00a0This makes Victoria happy. \u00a0Another thing that makes Victoria happy is free food. \u00a0Free food like these complimentary pumpkin puree and ricotta crostini. \u00a0They were lightly sweet and creamy with a delicately crisp round of bread beneath. \u00a0Me likey.We each selected a cocktail to compliment our meal. \u00a0I chose the Pineapple 75 Martini (Pineapple infused Ketel One, pineapple juice, lemon syrup, splash of Chambord) while my sister had the Strawberry Fields (Grey Goose Citron, muddled fresh strawberries, lemon syrup, fresh lemon and a Riesling floater). \u00a0Both drinks were refreshing, perfectly balanced, and just strong enough without tasting like straight alcohol. Mine was topped with a dehydrated pineapple chip, while the Strawberry Fields was garnished with a lemon crisp.The first of our plates to arrive were the Red Snapper Tacos and the Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies. \u00a0The tacos were served with mango and avocado, and a lime wedge and small dollop of spicy sauce by each mini taco. \u00a0I love how each taco came with its own accompaniments directly alongside, so no one would have to share their lime wedge, and no taco would feel neglected or unloved. \u00a0These were good, but my fish tacos are in a league of their own :) Meanwhile, the potato and goat cheese pierogies were my second favorite dish we tried! \u00a0They were tiny little packages filled with the traditional mashed potato component and replacing the more common farmer's or cottage cheese with their tangier cousin... goat cheese. \u00a0Topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by truffle creme fraiche, these were simply crescent-shaped bits of Heaven. \u00a0Highly recommend!The next wave of dishes included Barbecue Duck Confit and Black Bean Empanadas with Smoked Tomato and Blood Orange Jam, and of course the main event, the heavyweight champion of the world, the French Onion Soup Dumplings. \u00a0The empanadas each sat in their own little compartment, resting atop a spoonful of sauce, while the dish was served with a bowl of extra sauce. \u00a0The sauce alone tasted like bacon. \u00a0That is to say, it was very smoky. \u00a0Alone, the smoky flavor overpowered the other flavors in the sauce, but along with the empanadas, the sauce worked much better (though you could have fooled me about the contents of blood orange, as I didn't note any citrus flavors). \u00a0The filling was tender, juicy, and flavorful, with a spicy veil. \u00a0These were fun, and I'd enjoy having them again.The French Onion Soup dumplings were everything I thought they'd be. \u00a0I'm really glad I finally got to try them myself, because I really imagined the filling would be more soupy. \u00a0It was more like really wet fortified caramelized onions. \u00a0I had wanted to create this dish in my own kitchen for a long time, and definitely have a better perspective on the dish now. \u00a0I loved the combination of chewy dumpling dough, sweet and meaty melt-in-your-mouth onions, nutty and gooey melted Gruyere, and finally the crunchy crouton to top it all off. \u00a0These are a must have! \u00a0Even if I hadn't seen the episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate, or had these personally recommended to me by a former co-worker, or just happened to love French Onion Soup, our waiter made a point to suggest them to us. \u00a0I'm sure every person who walks through these doors will LOOOOOVE this dish.", "Date": "2011-01-06", "Author_Location": "Cranston, RI"}, {"Author": "Yosh H.", "ReviewID": "jh2Rn6WvvmCMlHZtwseDbw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have 50-50 feels about the Stanton Social. \u00a0It's a beautiful restaurant with great ambiance but it's also very popular (which isn't a bad thing for the owner/staff) which doesn't make a great dining experience. \u00a0I like eating and having a good conversation with my dining partners without the need to shout. \u00a0From my experience, it cannot happen at Stanton Social. \u00a0But what makes a restaurant should first and foremost be the food. \u00a0The Stanton Social's menu is primarily served tapas-style which means you order lots of little dishes for sharing. \u00a0Expensive little dishes. \u00a0During the course of dinner, my friend and I ordered the following:~ Maine Crabcake Corn Dogs - really delicious and creative. \u00a0Well-seasoned and really flavorful. \u00a0It was arguably the highlight of all the dishes we sampled with the exception of the dessert.~ Red Snapper Tacos (w/ creamy avocado & spicy mango) - Delicious as well. \u00a0Having the corn dogs and the tacos come as the first 2 dishes made my outlook for the meal very positive.~ Yellowfin Tuna Sashimi (w/ pickled jalapeno, avocado, & yuzu ginger dipping sauce) - not a huge fan of this dish. \u00a02 reasons. \u00a0One, I wasn't really in the mood for sashimi and two, this is a dish you can get any sushi restaurant in NY. \u00a0Why eat it here? \u00a0An obvious mistake on our ordering.~ Rhode Island Style Lobster Roll Slider & a Kobe Philly Slider (w/ truffle & goat cheese fondue) - buttered bread, bite-sized. \u00a0I think the concept of sliders are great 'cause you get a little sampling and it doesn't fill you up too fast. ~ Charred Squid Lettuce Wraps (w/ spicy papaya kimchi, miso mayo & jalapeno-soy) - the charred squid trumped the entire dish. \u00a0I think the dish got too complicated with the jalapeno-soy and the miso mayo. \u00a0It is worth getting once but definitely not my favorite of the meal.~ Hanger Steak & Tots (w/ tater tots, bleu cheese fondue & housemade cherry tomato ketchup) - I love tater tots and I love steak but again, this is a dish you can get at any other restaurant as well. \u00a0Why eat it here? \u00a0BUT, it was YUMMY so my tummy didn't complain.~ Pumpkin Profiteroles (w/ pumpkin pie pastry cream) - I want a tub of pumpkin profiteroles and candied currants now. \u00a0So good, so good, so good!!!!Overall, I had a good time. \u00a0I think it's grossly priced but hey, it was worth trying once. \u00a0And the service was good with an attentive staff. \u00a0But a restaurant with a uni-sex bathroom annoys me. \u00a04 stars (I liked the food but not the dining experience).", "Date": "2007-12-16", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Regina F.", "ReviewID": "dZ7BkoOJxu-B_DrV8m_O1g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Stanton Social has left me speechless.

This proved to be an exercise in futility as the waitstaff was far too cool to take orders, a reasonable disposition considering they had probably never met someone in whose gelled-up hair they couldn't see their reflection. \u00a0They likely passed me off as a homeless drifter who was setting up camp for the night in a dark corner of their trendy 'nightspot.' \u00a0Fortunately, I soon discovered that I could navigate my way to the bar by crawling under the bridges of the sequined 30-inch heels worn by the hoard of tweens forming a mosh-pit at the bar. \u00a0Delightful. \u00a0Aghast at the very concept of ordering a glow-in-the-dark cocktail mixed by some wannabe model, I ordered an overpriced Bud Light and a shot. \u00a0When it finally came time to order my meal, I craned my neck up at what millions years of evolution have deemed the perfect female prototype. \u00a0I didn't bother asking any questions about the menu as (a.) I couldn't read the menu in the dark, and (b.) it was clear our waitress had never eaten anything in her life and would only regurgitate whatever description was already written on the menu just like she had regurgitated everything else that may have accidentally wound up in her mouth over her precious twenty years of hating her father. \u00a0I got the damn dumplings and some pizza. The Stanton Social does have a few things going for it. They play bumpin' club music with killer bass and (probably) have some self-loathing, tattooed celebrity chef manning the kitchen, hating the fact that his bite-sized creations become frat-boy upchuck hours after being made. \u00a0If that's your thing, this is your place.

I looked around and found \"no bar\". I thought this was odd and perhaps I was not in the right \"Stanton Social\". Quickly, I asked the coat woman \"do you have a bar\"? She smiled (as if she had been asked this by many first timers) and pointed upstairs. Going back out and up, I found a well built gathering place, filled on this Friday night, with a centerpiece bar and seating at both ends of the room. Wine humidor in the back, showed a well stocked cellar and I \"chinned up\" for my first taste. The bartender greeted me and made the usual offerings, \"what can I get you\"? I, feeling comfortable, asked for a beer and menu. People on both sides of me were relaxed and either had food or empty plates in front of them (this is a good sign from my point of view). I ordered Piquillo Pepper Bruschetta, Chicken Caesar Bites and Red Snapper Tacos. Food came out quickly but it was \"oh so good\" (stole that expression from a TV celebrity chef)! For those who have read my reviews might realize I do not delve into long food descriptions; the menu should do this for you leaving out any mystery. My reviews are not about teaching a \"Master Chef Class\" on what is that criterion. No, I want it simple. I want people to get out and try the food, drink and social scene. Most restaurants have a hard working chef with hard working staff who may only get your respect for that moment. This place is solid. Food looked and tasted great.

She recommended we trek to the Lower East Side, so after finding the place, we made our way to the upstairs lounge where the crowd was social and lively! The atmosphere was very swanky, along with its patrons. We ended up sharing a couch with another couple. Interesting story about them; the guy must have been 45 years old but 25 at heart, while his date, aka his \"arm candy\", had to be 25 or younger. At first we were a bit shy in socializing with them but after a few drinks, the 4 of us were laughing it up together! We started buying eachother rounds and my date got so drunk, at one point she asked him \"so are you her dad or something?\" lol, but he laughed and said that would be incestuous if he was lol. I had to buy them another drink just to maintain our drunk diplomacy and it was a good evening for all.Anyway, getting back to this review about Stanton Social (sorry I have a tendency to digress), the upstairs lounge is pretty hip, yet can be a bit claustrophobic once it starts filling up in the later hours. Make sure you claim a couch as soon as you can! The cocktails on the menu were delicious and creative, certainly able to get you on a good buzz. Defintely try the following:Black MagicPear-Ginger Sake MartiniChampagne JulepBasil-Lime GimletThe second time I went to Stanton Social, me and my usual group of friends were able to get reservations for dinner and were seated in the dining area downstairs. The crowd was especially beautiful, while the atmosphere was effortlessly hip and sleek. The dim-lighting was just right, and each time we came, we were able to get their booth seating which was great because the booth setup provided us a good level of intimacy and privacy while still allowing us to watch the crowd. The food menu is just as good and worth going back for. My group and I have gone to Stanton Social a few more times and this is what we usually order and share amongst the group, brought to us in a specific order:Potato & Goat Cheese PierogiesGrilled Pizzeta with the chicken-apple sausageKobe Beef BurgerMeatballsLobster RollBeef WellingtonThe service was attentive, really had no complaints about it. We usually ask for them to bring us our plates in a specific order and pace, and they have always obliged with no problems. If there were any complaints about Stanton Social, is that sometimes the upstairs can get very crowded and there's a wait list to go at times. Also, to no fault of Stanton Social, my group and I sometimes go overboard on the amount of drinks and food we order and can get preeeeetty pricey lol.If you go to Stanton Social for the first time, you shouldn't be disappointed! Just make sure to bring your 'A' game, a nice set of clothes, and your credit card hehe.N.B. - Usually the downstairs dining area is saved for parties with reservations, but if you happen to be in the area around 12am or 1am, you have a good chance of getting a seat downstairs for some late night dining.", "Date": "2008-10-08", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Victoria G.", "ReviewID": "MSJuEAqjixU0KolIhJFSCw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've died and gone to flawless food heaven(ok a bit of an overstatement, but after reading a bazillion reviews and having enjoyed many a delicious strawberry fields cocktail in the bar sans food...it was time to get my hands on all SS had to offer)It was the perfect choice for a 5-girl birthday extravaganza...not only did they portion out most of the small plates to feed 5, but in the end, after ordering most of the menu and sucking down two cocktails each plus the INCREDIBLE DESSERT SHOT mmmmm, we each got outta there decently south of $100.The food:(and we were also catering to the vegetarian-leaning bday girl for some of these options)--Edamame with spicy miso glaze & Miso glazed mushrooms...Delicious. we couldn't keep our hands out of the bowl of the former and the latter was to die for--the miso was spot on--not too salty, not to sweet. Just mmmm. Simple yet satisfying.--Baby spinach salad. It's always nice i think to have at least one 'fresh' dish on the table--the greens and nuts were a perfect palette cleanser and the fresh spinach cut the heavier, more oily dishes abound.--Piquillo pepper bruschetta was fantastic. A perfect combination of textures and a play on warm and cool; it was assertive without being overwhelming. Delicious.--Soup Dumplings. I don't need to say a thing about these babies...we ordered 2 and they're hefty enough to leave you pregnant-bellied and happy. They are mortal opposites of Anita Lo's delicate foie gras dumpling, but they're density is delicious...and also accounts for the lingering scent of onions and truffles that hangs in the air of the dimly lit three story restaurant. --Red snapper tacos. One of the favorites. Sweet meets sour meets a delicate understated fish. Mmmm.Spicy lamb souvlakis. A bit overcooked and I have to say the harissa aoli was a bit over-spiced, but the plate was still cleaned!Chipotle Grilled Shrimp w feta and tomatillo. Simple. Delicious. We wanted more. Grilled shrimp is a staple and while this dish didn't blow us away, it was a great fresh meaty (in so far as shrimp has a pleasant mouthfeel and lets you know it's there) accompaniment to the other players on the table.-Hudson Valley foie gras. A. MAZE. BALLS. sorry, scuse my french but holy hell this was divine. Again, it's not that hard to mess up foie but this was like foie donning a sequined party dress. Mmmmm.--Grilled eggplant parm. So So So good. Like, I could be a vegetarian if this was what I was 'made' to eat. Not over oily in the least and was perfectly filling and kept our forks poking. --KObe sliders. OMFG. I could've had 12 of these. Perfectly cooked, with or without cheese you can't lose. The best mini burger I've ever had, hands down.--Social mac and cheese was pretty standard. It was god don't get me wrong, i mean it is mac and cheese, but it pales in comparison with Cafeteria's mac attack.--Pierogies. &. Short rib tacos. My least favorites of the evening. The pierogies were far too dense in an unappealing way--the potato and pastry crust ratio was a bit off. With the tacos, they were just very eeh. There were far more appealing options on the table.I am dying to try the octopus, tuna sashimi, crusted salmon, scallops, meatballs...droolingnowall over myselfIt was truly a memorable evening..not only because i was surrounded by amazing company, but the food really was an event in itself and along with strong and plentiful cocktails...Stanton Social gets a bonafide A+ and I will be back...often", "Date": "2011-03-31", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Katie M.", "ReviewID": "GUnrqCKbAHa51m6BokDWBw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In attendance for a birthday party. \u00a0Expected an over-hyped, played out restaurant. \u00a0The atmosphere was a bit seen-be-seen, but the food was amazing. \u00a0I mean, every bite delicious goodness. \u00a0Every bite, yum. \u00a0Not one bad plate. \u00a0Those spare ribs - I could live in the sauce. \u00a0The miso glazed sea bass had a butter like texture. \u00a0The steak frites perfectly proportioned. \u00a0I was in love with the pork tacos. \u00a0I'm making a return trip very soon.", "Date": "2008-07-24", "Author_Location": "Oakland, CA"}, {"Author": "Albert L.", "ReviewID": "fLDy6_MmtsY4mCloI0TSig", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took my girlfriend here on her birthday with a couple of her friends.

Welcome to the land of power lunches and happy hour.Step in Stanton Social.The lower East Side's choice for the sexiest two-story lounge and restaurant. Modeled after the 1940's era, you will see the demure influence in everything from the waitstaff's attire to the herringbone pattern of the 2,000 bottles of wine on display on the main floor, to the fringe and hand mirrors decorating the walls.The upstairs bartender at Stanton was a doll and concocted several drinks for me including The Social Tea (Ketel One Citron, gunpowder green tea and orange-honey marmalade), Strawberry Fields ( Grey Goose Citron, fresh strawberries muddled with lemon-lime syrup, fresh lemon juice and a Riesling floater), and my person favorite, The Basil-Lime Gimlet (Belvedere Vodka, muddled basil leaves, lemon syrup and fresh lime juice.) If you are hungry, I would highly recommend the Grilled Cheese Slider. The size of a golf ball, the mini-sandwich is Jasper Hills Farms Cheddar, house cured jalapeno bacon, fried green tomatoes and lemon aioli. Another option I tried was the Old School Meatballs, with basil and manicotti. Hearty but light, these meatballs literally melted in your mouth. The menu at Stanton is all small-plates-multi-orgin-emphasis-on-comfort-food, so their is something for everyone. Other mouth-watering items included: an array of sliders, grilled pizzette, french onion soup dumplings, braised short rib tacos, crab cake corn dogs and foie gras PB & J. One thing I have to say is that the food is not consistent. The grilled cheese is different every time I show up now, and I've had some great meals here...and some very unmemorable ones.

Seriously, I'm only 20 years old and this place had me feeling like a middle aged person wishing for an aspirin from the loudness of the music. The food was really good, all were very creative interpretations of the original dishes and were good for sharing. I love tapas style eating because you can sample as many dishes as you want. I would recommend the French onion soup dumplings, the duck empanadas, the passionfruit cheesecake with basil sorbet (so refreshing), and the 90 proof milkshake shots. But the music was way too loud. I understand that it's trying to be hip and stylish, but really. When I'm eating I want to be able to talk to my dining companions. I would return here for brunch, but not for dinner. The wait was also awful even though I'd made reservations before hand. The hostess was also terrible, possibly the most vapid, dull-eyed creature I have ever met in my life. If she wasn't a size zero, there is no way that she would ever be in the working world. I went up no less than 5 times to inquire after my table and each time she would ask for every single piece of information all over again, then sort of wander around lifelessly without seeming to be actively looking for a table before telling me it would be a while longer. She even had the nerve to cut me off midway through me telling her my name, to 'HOLD ON A SECOND!' Seriously? I have been holding on for thirty minutes!! Ugh, I hate incompetent people. Anyway, good food, not too ridiculous prices, would return for lunch/brunch.July 28, 2008So I did return for brunch, and this time I was somewhat underwhelmed. Thankfully, the music was softer, providing a nicer atmosphere and I was seated almost immediately. I guess the incompetent hostess only works the night shift. The brunch offerings are pretty much the same with the addition of a few breakfast foods (pancakes, eggs benny, etc). This time however, I found the food a little unsatisfying.

One star may seem a harsh, but \"Eek! Methinks not\" is a pretty good way to sum it up. If you are reading reviews to help you decide whether to go or not, I'd strongly recommend you read the low star reviews and take note, because they hit the nail on the head. I was floored to see that so many people have rated this place so highly on Yelp -- they must be impressed with the scene more than the food. The best thing I can say is that some of the food was tasty (but nothing memorable,) and clearly it's a trendy place where people come to see and be seen. If you are coming for the food or for the overall dining experience, save yourself a wad of cash and go elsewhere. Why? The food is uber expensive and the portions are so small (even the items that are around $20!) that you basically need tweezers instead of a fork. My favorite quote from another Yelper: \"I felt like my little niece was serving us play food from her Barbie oven. \u00a0I love Tapas but these were hors d'oeurves at best!\" \u00a0So do not to go there hungry, and know that you will not leave full, even if you spend $50 each. My friend was really enthusiastic about trying this place and made a reservation. I have to admit, I didn't like the vibe or the decor from the moment we arrived. We went for lunch and although it was a beautiful, sunny day outside, the restaurant was dark and dimly lit, making it seem like it was nighttime. Not only that, but the music was definitely \"night\" as well - some sort of loud and annoying techno lounge music. We waited about 20 minutes after we were seated for a waiter to appear. He finally showed after we told the busboy we wanted to order. After that, the service was perfunctory and not at all personal. The food was just OK - some was pretty good, but nothing was memorable. The menu looked like it had a lot of creative dishes but I can honestly say that it was a lot better on paper than on the plate. Chicken with waffles - meh. Lobster Eggs Benedict - tiny (as in two pieces that were 2 bites each) and needed salt (but none to be found on the table.) We asked for bread -- tiny! \u00a0 The couple next to us ordered the croque monsieur satay (there's a photo posted if you want to see) and it was literally 4 small cubes, each about the size of a piece of Russell Stover's chocolate, or maybe a walnut. And they let the busboy clear 2 of them, as well as some waffles - I would have eaten them! \u00a0That's how hungry I was, and not looking forward to dropping another $5 per bite!! My friend said the Bloody Mary was spicy and good, but my pomegranate champagne cocktail was just so so. I was dying when we walked around the 'hood and saw all the great looking places advertising $15 (and less) prix fixe brunches. \u00a0Do yourself a favor and check them out.

It was 3 of us and we fit comfortably and with pIenty \u00a0was all very dimly lit with both lamps and candle all around the dining area. The waitress came over and took our drink orders and the drinks promptly arrived a few minutes later. The staff overall was excellent . They were uber friendly and attentive is an understatement between each serving of the various plates a waitres came over and gave us new clean plates. Someone was constantly cleanin or clearing our plates as we finished or filling our water or folding our unsused napkins. The french onion soup dumplings are a MUST try!! They have to be one of your plates. Sometimes I debate just ordering 4 plates of the dumplings because they are just that fantastic. Everything else is pretty good too. It is all seasoned well, well-cooked \u00a0and tastes fresh. \u00a0I have tried \u00a0the red snapper tacos, the Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies, Sweet & Sour Chicken & Cashew Spring Roll, hand pulled chicken arepas,Maryland Jumbo Lump Crabcake 'Corn Dogs,Chipotle Grilled Shrimp \u00a0- tomatillo & feta relish, and the Spicy Lamb Souvlakis - tzatziki, lime, harissa aioli. Out of all those my least favorite were the pierogies only because I did not realized they were fried and I don't really like them fried. They are a bit too oily. The hand pulled arepas are so small they are very crispy but none the less delicious. I had the warm donuts and the Strawberry shortcake sundae for dessert. Both were pretty good but I preferred the sundae. I recommend making reservations because it gets pretty packed regardless of the night. I have not tried he drinks but they looked pretty good. They have full bar and wine selections. Its a nice place that you might just past by and not even notice because the only sign is really small and on the door. This is definitely a must go to place in NYC. \u00a0So good its been featured on the Food Network. I am a big foodie and always goes to places featured on the Food Network shows and they have yet to fail me. Do not hesitate to try this place you will not regret it. \u00a0 Remember people this is a tapas bar so everything is extremely small you will need several plates. And my only other complaint is that several of the plates come in 3's of whatever the food is, which does not make much sense if it's only 2 people sharing. There are plates that come in 4's.

These were everything a LES pickle should be!!- Warm Piquillo Pepper 'Bruschetta' stuffed with roasted garlic-goat cheese: the pepper and goat cheese went so well together and the bread was perfectly crisp, yet didn't cut the roof of your mouth!- Zucchini Tempura - tomato jam and asiago: Tastes exactly how you think it will.

I took a bite and said \"I never understood chicken & waffles before, but now I do.\" I didn't realize these were $18 - not sure it's worth that, but it is good!!- Braised Short Rib Soft Tacos - tomato, red onion & smoked paprika relish, 'refried' cranberry beans: I don't remember these now that I am writing this, but I vaguely remember it being good...

I'm getting over it slowly.Arepas: Not sure how these are considered arepas, but they are damn good. Nice spicy sauce and lots happening.Octopus: We thoroughly enjoyed it, but I suspect that we liked it more because it was our first dish and we were ravenous. Looking back, it was just alright.Meatballs: Probably prefer the meatball factory (of course) but these monstrous balls of deliciousness were definitely super.Kobe philly slider: the winner. Get it. You'll be happy you did.Beets: sweet, grilled very well, really nice light compliment to heavy, rich tapas.Chocolate tasting: Not sure why three of us dudes got this, definitely overkill, but that's the name of the game at Stanton Social. The chocolate ice cream has a wicked spice to it, that only kicks in after you've finished the ice cream. Really cool. The peanut butter on a stick was a bit rich for me (yet I finished it...) the mint chocolate was a nice touch and the coconut balls with more chocolate was so good. By the time we got to the pudding and warm chocolate cake, I was ready to explode. There was more (we have 3 dishes each), but that will suffice for this review. To recap: Food is amazing, service is good, music is good (although they repeated a couple of songs, and were generally not very creative with their selection - kind of chose obvious tunes/remixes), price is a touch on the steep side (which is expected) but as a treat once in a while, I highly recommend this place.", "Date": "2011-10-08", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Juliette V.", "ReviewID": "Swiwe7sf5xvHofTvqsGoDw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cool place, good music.

I even liked it after we went to this place in a snowstorm after a long long long day of work. I usually don't like many things, places, people after a day like this. First off the place was cute and dimly lit. I cannot comment on the lounge which I did not get a chance to see but the dining room was cute. Very charming and warm. We were a group of 6 so we were seated at a table near the kitchen. We ordered 2 bottles of champagne and A LOT of food. Here is what I remember we ordered and the review;Wok Charred Edamame- very surprised they weren't shelled but the taste was very niceWarm Piquillo Pepper Crostini stuffed with goat cheese- very nice taste, the peppers and cheese complimented each other very well.Zucchini Tempura- the worst of all the orders and the only one that had leftovers.Potato and Goat Cheese Perogies- AMAZING. Could have eaten this all night.French Onion Soup Dumplings- well recievedYellowfin Tuna Sashimi- nice but ordinarySweet and Sour Chicken Cashew Rolls- great reviewsRed Snapper Tacos- unbelievable. Another dish I would have ordered more than one.Chipotle Shrimp- reasonably good.Crabcake Corndogs- yummy and totally unexpectedHangar Steak and Tots- these were raved about by the meat eaters.Chicken and Waffles- also a rave reviewWasabi Pea Salmon- pretty decentGrilled Pizette with Mozzarella and oven dried tomato- also amazing.My own personal top picks are: Pierogies, pizette, red snapper tacos, crostiniIn addition these were added: chicken and waffles, crabcake corndogs, cashew chicken spring rolls and hangar steak and tots as the resounding favorites. \u00a0For dessert we ordered the Twinkie trio. Red velvet, peanut butter chocolate and classic vanilla. We enjoyed. We also ended up spending a fortune with 2 bottles of champagne and some of the dishes we doubled up on since they're smaller. That's where they really get you on the bill so BE CAREFUL. Also they kept on bringing the food out in spurts so when you'd think you were done a whole new course came out. So pace yourself and try to only order 2 a person instead of 3 dishes. Loses a star for noise level. If you go here with more than 4 people, your conversation will be lost and you won't be able to talk to anyone but your adjacent neighbor. Will defininitely be back here.

Not bad for a packed Saturday night. The only caveat was that they'd need our table by 10 pm, so we weren't able to take our time at the end of the meal. We all felt that we were being hurried along by about ten minutes til 10, but we were late for the reservation, so I can't blame them entirely.I am huge fan of Chef Santos's food (I go to Beauty & Essex about once a month), and I had been to Stanton Social for drinks before taking my friends here last weekend. Our meal started shakily because 3 dishes arrived before any of our drinks, without any apology from our server. Also, we didn't do the typical group ordering--a couple of us ordered our own things, and then a couple were sharing between them. We made this clear to our server, but when the food came out, 2 of us didn't have any of the food we ordered, so we weren't eating with anyone else. We were done with the first dishes by the time our drinks came to the table. I would have much preferred waiting longer for the food, so we could have at least had a few sips of our cocktails before eating. When I eat at places like this, I expect the service to be impeccable. I wouldn't be so harsh if this were a diner or some place more casual. But at $16 a drink, things should be brought out in the right order.Every dish we ordered was fantastic. Exactly what I've come to expect and love about Santos's food. We ended up having to order more food, but our waitress didn't come back until long after we finished our first cocktail, so we had to down them as they shooed us out of our table at precisely 10 pm. Again, partially our fault but we could have easily drank 3 cocktails a piece in the time we were sitting.I will probably stick to B&E from now on, as I have had nothing but exceptional service there.

The tables are spaced out enough that you can actually talk to the people you came with instead of being bombarded with noise from all sides. The lighting is very romantic and the upstairs dining area looked cute. Food - um, can you say yum?! We \u00a0got the potato and goat cheese perogies - absolutely fabulous! There was the perfect proportion of goat cheese to potato. Banana pancakes - DIVINE! Just the right amount of sweetness with candied pecans and bananas on top coupled with a vanilla syrup to die for. We also ordered the french onion dumplings - presentation was good, but taste was DEF lacking. I actually love french onion soup, but hated these! They didn't loose a star though because I think it might have been b/c I'm not a cheddar person and it had massive amounts of cheddar on top. The breakfast bruschetta was def yum, but I should have ordered it with egg whites cuz I hate yolk! The egg consistency was good though..very fluffy and the toast was perfectly toasted. The spinach frittata was so light...it had a touch too much goat cheese, but I think that's just me cuz I'm not a fan of eggs and cheese together. \u00a0I am dying to go back to try the kobe beef burgers, apple and brie quesadilla, and the pizzata which looked amazing!

The main entrance to the place is a bit understated but the space itself is nicely done.

Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you though, the restaurant stretches deep within its lot and has three levels of fanciful, glamorous seating space. After hearing all the raves about this locale, I was expecting lavishness full to the brim - excesses possibly not unlike those at Beauty & Essex. Turns out the interior is not quite as bejeweled, nor gimmicky at all, but in fact very tasteful and very classy. Glass-tube lights suspend from the ceiling and dim yellow cake shaped lamps hang on thin rods against a whitewashed brick wall - the whole place was very intimate despite a noticeable air of sophistication, without the help of chandeliers! Firstly, I loved the drinks here. I got a mint-grapefruit martini, which was a) delicious and b) solidly heady. Bartenders, why can't you all just make good drinks like this?? ...oh you don't gross $19 a glass?..Whatever, that's no excuse.Food was 4 stars. Definitely delish, but not mind blowing. - Red snapper tacos (4 stars - bold flavor, loved that fresh corn tortilla taste, needed more focus on the snapper)- Tuna sashimi (3 stars - meh)- Potato and goat cheese pierogies with creme fraiche (my friend remarked that this was really good sour cream and I wagged my finger no no its 'creme fraiche'. Turns out creme fraiche \u00a0is basically sour cream. Oop. Wikipedia tells me its 28% butterfat with a pH of 4.5, and that it's even more fattening than sour cream. Fascinating. (5 stars - these were my favorite of the night. Pierogies were delicious and the coat of caramelized onions topped it all off)) - Kobe truffle philly (4 stars - it was good and full of flavor, can't remember much about it, and don't remember experiencing the lingering truffle oils on my palate. Random thought since this dish came with salt and vinegar chips: why doesn't anyone sell ketchup chips, EH? They were all the rave back in Canada.)- French onion soup dumplings (3 stars - as the signature dish, I really expected much more. There was no soup in the soup dumpling (blasphemy) and the entire plate just seemed very hastily put together)- Chocolate tasting (4.5 stars - this was amazing. chocolate ice cream with chili spice, mint chocolates, chocolate panna cotta, strawberry truffles, some tart, and some mousse pops)The Stanton Social definitely lives up to its hype, but for the price and for good wine, I'd still go to Alta any day!There you go, a nice, detailed review to kickstart 2012 yelp elite badge day :) woohoo!!", "Date": "2012-01-06", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Danielle A.", "ReviewID": "AV4mZVaYJciR1GaGJ739Fw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had dinner at Stanton Social with two girlfriends on Saturday evening. \u00a0We went early (8:15) because we had a later reservation at Beauty & Essex. \u00a0At 8pm, Stanton Social was already jammed. \u00a0Quite a nice space, and the staff was kind and inviting from the get go.We had some good drinks (the strawberry fields was particularly yummy) and we ordered seven plates to share. The onion soup dumplings are not to be missed. Ditto for the braised ribbed tacos. \u00a0Pierogies and red snapper tacos were also standouts. \u00a0The other three dishes (salmon, spinach salad, shrimp) were fine. \u00a0Not bad in any sense, but not particularly remarkable. \u00a0Bear in mind that these are SMALL plates. Think two or three items per order, so plan accordingly. \u00a0The staff does warn you about this, though, and they recommend an appropriate amount of food. \u00a0Our waitress was quite good - attentive but not overbearing. She didn't try to rush us, and we felt that we could have sat and sipped as long as we wanted. We also had her split the check amongst two credit cards and cash, which I'm sure was annoying. She was cheerful and didn't seem to mind at all. \u00a0Yay - Stanton Social!Two final thoughts: 1) make your reservation in advance. We called on Thursday for Saturday night, and with a bit of begging, they were able to accommodate us, but we were seated right near the door, next to the coat racks in the vestibule, which was quite crowded with people waiting for their tables. \u00a0While it's a bit irritating having people hovering over your table, it was even more irritating when people started SITTING DOWN at our table. \u00a0Yes - turning the two empty chairs around and plopping down, as if this is normal. \u00a0(Note: I don't blame SS for the rudeness of its clientele. \u00a0In fact, the maitre d hustled over each of the three times it happened to remove these individuals from our table. \u00a0Still annoying though, and probably avoidable if you book early and get a table in the main dining room). \u00a02) it's in the East Village, which I personally loathe going to. \u00a0It's a pain in the neck to get to with all the road closures, and you're literally assaulted with pan handlers whilst walking to and from. \u00a0I am generally very sympathetic to people down on their luck, but after the fifth person asked me for money (aggressively) I'd had enough. \u00a0Just something else to bear in mind, as it made me uncomfortable, particularly when I was standing outside alone.Other than that, carry on!

Tasty and pretty (not something I say often).After two drinks, I realized we were waiting at the wrong bar so we decided one more round.

Not greasy at all which surprised me.I had the eggs Benedict with jalapeno bacon and goat cheese corn bread. The Hollandaise was about average in my opinion, nothing that really stood out. The bacon was quite a surprise though, a nice little bit of heat from the jalapeno and of course the classic salty bacon flavor. That went really well together. The corn bread was corn bread, I certainly did not taste goat cheese in it. It was also served with home fries that were good, perfectly good and with a bit of heat to with them too.My friend had the pizzetta, a flat bread pizza of a sort.

Our waiter come over to take our drink orders - at the time we were still waiting for one of my friends to show up, but were looking at the menu and trying to have a conversation. The music was extremely loud, and even though we were sitting at a small table, we could barely hear each other. We placed our drink orders, and asked the waiter if he could please ask the manager to turn the music down a bit since it was so loud. As we waited for our drinks, my other friend showed up. The waiter came back to ask for her drink order. My mother mentioned to him that it seemed like the music had not be turned down, and had he happened to mention the request yet to the manager. His reply was \"Yes, but I am not going to bother him/ask again, as he has gone into his office and closed the door.\" In a tone that was kind of snippy.We all kind of looked at each other in surprise. I don't think I have ever been spoken to like that at a restaurant, or had a manager pretty much ignore a customer's request. Especially since the place was empty, and we were pretty much the only party there. (I have worked in the food industry, and I know that any manager that I have worked for would have turned down the music a little bit had there been a request to do so)My Mother politely asked him if he could ask again, as it really was difficult to hold a conversation. He went off to ask, and shortly came back with this reply - \"He said that he was not going to turn down the music as it was going to get busy soon and then it would just get loud again.\" We were all surprised at that comment, and were kind of looking at each other in amazement. We started to wonder if we should just get drinks and then go have dinner elsewhere. The waiter was still standing at the table, and said in a bit of a condescending tone \" Are you sure you still want your drinks?\". Well, after that, we just pretty much looked at him, looked at each other, and then said NO. Actually. We do not.

Everything about our dinner experience was fine, but nothing really wowed us.For drinks, my husband had the Strawberry Fields which I tried and enjoyed. He liked the fresh muddled strawberries in it. I had the 1940s Champagne Julip which was also good, although it had a little too much basil. For food we had caesar salad crostini (amuse bouche), chicken arepas, green apple and brie quesadilla, chipotle grilled shrimp, chicken and waffles, butternut squash and sweet potato ravoli, and the herb fries. Our favorite dish was the chicken arepas (it was definitely the standout of the night) with the chicken and waffles also being good, although it needed a touch more maple syrup. The ravoli was my least favorite dish by far so I left that to my husband to eat. The husband was disappointed in the shrimp dish (he felt it needed more heat), but I thought it was fine. We both felt the quesadilla needed more brie. We skipped dessert as none really stood out on the menu. For our two drinks, the food, tax and tip, our bill came to $130The atmosphere is definitely trendy with music playing, so make sure to speak up if you want your dining companion to hear you.

My husband and I had dinner at Chris Santos' famous small bites restaurant this past weekend. The ambiance has a cool vibe, dim lighting, but not overly trendy. Some may say the music is too loud, but I thought noise level was moderate for the feel they're going for.Service was on par, waitress was attentive, gave suggestions of staff favorites, and the food came at a nice pace. And speaking of the food, here is what we ordered:Thai noodle salad- hands down the best I've had. Small nuggets of lightly fried tofu, just the right amount of flat egg noodles, crunchy veggies added great texture and dressing was a blend of tang, sweetness, and saltiness. My favorite dish of the night.Chicken and waffles- While the chicken was done to perfection- white meat, very thick and juicy, lightly seared with a crispy skin (not battered and fried like most chicken and waffle dishes)- the waffles themselves were too dense for me. Also, I think the dish could have overall used a little more sweetness, perhaps more of the sauce.Snapper tacos- Good, not great. The snapper was blended in with avo crema, and even though the taco had a nice crunch, I though the snapper blend tasted quite \"meaty\" and filling. Shrimp and grits- if shrimp and grits are on the menu, you can bet your last dollar that I'm going to order it. I love shrimp and grits and try it if it pops up on the menu at any respectable looking restaurant. (The best I've had are still at Hattie's in Dallas, creamy grits, a wonderful tang from small dollops of goat cheese, raw green onions for some colors, and a semi smoky, spicy red sauce... But I digress.) This dish had a kick in it, and the portion of shrimp (6 large ones) was good. The grits had a polenta like texture and were a bit thick and dry for my taste. Curried cauliflower- Sorry, but very disappointing, especially compared to the rest of our dishes. Portion was tiny, cauliflower (white and green) were too al dente, and there was definitely the curry flavor, but nothing special. Side note- we arrived 20 mins early for our reservations but got seated promptly. Overall I give the food and dining experience 4 stars and it lived up to my expectations.

Then our table was tilted, and all our dishes kept sliding down to my friend.

I'd have to say that my biggest problem is with the terrible ambience.But with that out of the way, the food was pretty good. I think the french onion soup dumplings are overhyped, because (1) they smell gross, (2) the cheese is too hard, and (3) they're not so much soup dumplings as vesicles for caramelized and therefore soggy onions. Red snapper tacos weren't that impressive either. On the other hand, the tuna tartare rolls were amazing! I didn't know what to expect but I expected wrong and was delighted - it's raw tuna wrapped with a puff pastry-like dough, and flavored/seasoned/done whatever to to make it delicious!

We also ordered several of the small dishes, including the chicken and waffles (these were sub-par), the sliders (yummy, minus the pickles which I hate), and some others. The drinks were what really racked up the bill. Each person paid $75 (10 people so $750 after tips and taxes) which was RIDICULOUS!

The disappointing thing is that, well, its just gussied up French onion soup. I also think its better to serve these hot puppies in individual spoons so you can easily break the dumpling in the spoon and slurp up the contents; with the cheese coating the top of each pocket in the escargot dish, it's a challenge to keep your toothpick-poked dumpling intact while extricating it from the blanket of cheese. \u00a0My friends and I are from California so we abide by the rule of not eating Mexican food north of Santa Barbara or East of Texas but Kelly ordered the red snapper tacos and what a surprise, they were unexpectedly delicious! \u00a0 I've had great seafood tacos and their red snapper tacos are up there with my faves - tasty, the fish was moist and not overdone, and the avocado and mango was a nice counterpoint. \u00a0Unfortunately there were no other standouts from the rest of our order (8 tapas plates, 1 dessert), which is really unfortunate because they've got some interesting combinations of textures and flavors on their menu that just don't live up to the description. \u00a0I do appreciate that their menu is reasonably priced, especially for what you would expect given that its New York and the decor just screams bougie. \u00a0 The tapas menu also makes it easy to share with your table without getting too full. \u00a0 I also appreciate that though their menu is fusion, is doesn't draw from just one type of cuisine but rather from many so there are opportunities to satisfy the tastes of everyone in your party; the caveat is that their menu lacks cohesiveness and can seem like a mishmash of different dishes. \u00a0Stanton Social suffers from trying to be all things to all people. \u00a0 If they focused their efforts to augment their strengths and downplay their weaknesses, it could be a much better experience. \u00a0Technically I could do a 3 star on this joint but given that the expectations are so high when come on, this is New York so I expected better especially given that they've got so many 5 star reviews.

Bypassing the dismal service received during the dinner, when we received the dinner cheque, we noticed the bill included a 20% gratuity. \u00a0Considering the horrible experience that was the dinner, I addressed this issue to the manager, advised him our dining party should choose whether or not to tip. \u00a0The manager got frustrated and proceeded to speak with us rudely, informing us that he was tired of trying to accommodate our party, and that we had signed a contract mandating a 20% gratuity (NB: \u00a0the contract does not mandate any such gratuity.) \u00a0When a member of the party informed him that there is no way such a contract would have been signed based on the profession of certain party members, the manager, rudely stated that he did not care what we did for a living. (P.s., dude, you actually should care because you have absolutely no clue who your guests are apparently.) \u00a0I tried to point out to the manager that we were not making up our experiences that night- we wore (and were still wearing!) winter coats during our dinner (I even had to find a guy to borrow a bulky one from him), we were seated over 45 minutes past our reservation time, we were seated right next to the door (which, at one point, the \"bouncer\" held open for nearly five minutes), a blanket served as the wall next to us, serving as a boundary between the coat check area and our dining area, we were STILL eating dinner at past 1AM (even as we discussed the check with the manager), and we were excluded and isolated from the New Year's eve revelry- the whole point of dining at Stanton Social anyway. \u00a0The manager angrily agreed to take off the gratuity from the bill and advised us not to return to Stanton Social. \u00a0Also, while modifying the bill, he proceeded to complain loudly about us to one of his staff members within earshot!! He could have at least had the decency to wait until we were out of earshot to do the complaining.This was objectively the absolute worst New Year's eve experience any of us ever had. \u00a0During one of the manager's outbursts at our \"unreasonable\" demands, he mentioned that this was New Year's eve and essentially that we were ruining it for him. \u00a0Nope, not asinine at all. \u00a0On the contrary, we were paying to the Stanton Social establishment (a not small sum of money) to provide US with a memorable New Year's eve celebration. \u00a0That he was okay to ruin every last bit of our New Year's eve, while complaining about his celebration remains quite shocking to everyone. \u00a0And when some of the members of our dining party dared complain on yelp, they receive the a form email from their \"Social Media Director\" saying that we should let them know if we need help making a reservation.

It was time for another drink just before we ordered dessert so I ordered the pineapple martini, that was more impressive and tasty then the cranberry one. It had a dried pineapple on top and was delicious! For dessert we ordered the warm donuts that come with several dipping sauces. This definitely did not disappoint, was worth every penny and I would come back the next time I am in NY!

I'm wincing in giving this restaurant close to four stars because the service here is brusque and unwelcoming. The food on the other hand is surprisingly delicious. I've dined at Stanton Social 3-4 times over the past 6 years or so. The menu is largely unchanged but the execution of the food this visit was outstanding. I was frankly surprised at how much we liked it.Service & AtmosphereLet's get the downer out of the way. Yes this place is dark with a vibrant, sexy vibe. I have been upstairs for drinks before, which is also a great spot. However, they pack the entire restaurant to the gills. I think it's a fire hazard. You can barely move as they have table upon table of large group dinners. It's also deafeningly loud and hard to even hear someone across the table from you. 4 out of the 5 of us arrived within 10 minutes of the reservation and they said we could be seated if we started ordering immediately. I appreciate that as I'm sure most people have that one friend who is always running 30-45 minutes late. Our waitress was such a turnoff. She would approach, then when we didn't know within 10 seconds what we wanted to order she would promptly pivot and rush away. This happened several times and was annoying as it was impossible to wave her down through the throng of diners. When she finally returned, I ordered everything in one shot so that we could just go about enjoying our birthday dinner. Our waitress also barely cracked a smile and actually looked pained throughout the meal except when we started ordering more drinks and a second bottle of wine. She probably felt better that there was a bigger tip coming out of our table. But honestly her sourpuss did put a damper on the meal.Food & DrinksAs this is a small plates format, I'll group the foods into general categories. The only dish I did not enjoy was the red snapper tacos. I've had these before here and they were not good this time around as the fish was neither hot nor cold and it did not taste fresh. The dishes that were solid were the East and West coast oysters, the amuse bouche of ceasar salad on a crostini, the foie gras, the beef wellington and the lobster roll. The other ladies loved the skillet roast octopus, soaking up the sauce with pieces of bread. I thought it was only ok, having had much better (more tender) octopus the weekend before at Craftbar. The outstanding dishes really made the meal memorable. The French onion soup dumplings were amazing. I've had these on two other occasions before and thought they were always dry and lacking. This time around they were soupy, cheesy and very flavorful. The kobe beef slider (not cheap at $7 a pop) was juicy and intense. Lastly, the Thai spiced baby back ribs are something I'll be thinking about for a while. The sauce was mildly spicy, mildly sweet and the meat fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. Wow. I would go back just to eat the ribs again. We also had 2 bottles of sauvignon blanc and 4 mixed drinks. By the time dessert came, we were very full. We had a strawberry shortcake sundae and the warm doughnuts. Both were objectively amazing but our enthusiasm was somewhat muted by the fact that we had already eaten so much delicious food.While the small plates seem reasonably priced on the menu, each plate only comes with 2-3 portions, which had to be \"upsized\" to 5 portions for our group. This quickly added up and our bill including all of the alcohol came out to $92 per person if we had split it evenly. The consistently delectable food is what made this meal enjoyable. The service and atmosphere is really a matter of one's tolerance level and preference for a specific type of scene.", "Date": "2011-08-16", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Bobbi P.", "ReviewID": "mTqckM9Q8Kvch7buwLeu2A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd recommend this spot for brunch mostly because they offer a unique twist to it, serving it tapas style.

We ordered about 5 small plates and they were brought to the table at a nice and steady clip. I really enjoyed the pierogies with the truffle cream (the carmelized onions put it over the top for me), thai baby back ribs (tangy and fall off the bone), and maryland crab cake corn dogs (very creative). I also liked the red snapper tacos, but they were tiny and only come in a set of 3. However, they were tightly packed with goodness. The chicken and waffles were rather forgettable since the chicken was dry. I was somewhat disappointed with the french onion soup dumplings. The cheese was already dried/stale by the time we got it (which indicates that it was way overheated or left out for a while).

We had a group of 20+ so we had a reservation for an area of the upstairs lounge area. The upstairs area is pretty small - one side has lounge sofas and tables, and the other side have regular dining tables that are placed very close to each other. The standing bar area was packed when we got there at 7:30pm and stay packed until the time we left at around 10:30pm. So it is important to make reservations if you want to sit down. The music is pretty loud - not loud enough so you have to speak directly into people's ears but loud enough that you have to lean forward and raise your voice - in all fine for our big group who are all in a celebratory mood and getting ready to go to a club afterwards but probably not great otherwise. The food is pretty decent, each portion I'd say is pretty substantial for tapas standard. \u00a0(The women in the group were happily stuffed but the guys can still go for more food after). We had the pierogies, souvlaki, tacos, shrimp, kobe beef sliders, quesadilla, lobster roll and a fig foie gras thing which might be a bday speical since i don't see it on the regular menu. All of these items are very nicely presented on dish, all tasted good but a bit too strongly seasoned. Of the bunch I'd say my favorites are the kobe beef sliders and the quesadilla. The items that made the most impression at the end of the night are the cocktails and the dessert. I had the strawberry fields and basil-lime gimlet and would have gone for another of the basil-lime gimlet. I was surprised that muddled basil can taste so good and refreshing in a cocktail without being to overpowering - highly recommend you to try it. I think about half of the group ended up ordering this drink. We had the donuts and Jaime's cookies for dessert and oh my gosh both were really delicious. The donuts were warm and the taste and texture reminded me of a Chinese dessert ( sa yung) I love growing up. The cookies were chewy and warm and was just a really great way to end the meal.

It was different, but good. \u00a0The food was amazing and the drinks were even better than the food. \u00a0Starting with the food... \u00a0 They serve a tapas menu. \u00a0Entrees are about six bites a piece. \u00a0We ordered the French Onion Soup Dumplings. \u00a0They were as delicious as they looked on TV. \u00a0They are individual french onion soup bites with lots of cheese. \u00a0We also ordered red snapper tacos, chicken and waffles and miso glazed mushrooms. \u00a0For the two of us we started with three items and then ordered one more after we finished the first three. \u00a0They bring your items one at a time, so ordering one later worked out perfectly. \u00a0We finished off our meal with one of the 90-proof milkshake shots. \u00a0Now for the drinks... You have to order the Strawberry Fields drink. \u00a0You won't be disappointed. \u00a0It was wonderful. \u00a0My husband ordered the pineapple martini and the Basil-lime Gimlet. \u00a0The basil-lime was good, but you have to really like basil. \u00a0The pineapple martini was very refreshing. \u00a0The drinks are really strong. \u00a0As the other review said, \"If you come out full you know you spent a lot of money.\" \u00a0We were stuffed, so we spent lots of money. \u00a0It was worth every penny. \u00a0We will definitely go back when we visit New York again and will recommend it to all of our friends.", "Date": "2012-08-06", "Author_Location": "Florence, SC"}, {"Author": "Helen Z.", "ReviewID": "DwbUbzLdj_DI4wF_hspMnA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went here for a birthday dinner on a Thursday night. \u00a0We were seated early, no waiting (but had a 6PM reservation on a rainy day so that might have something to do with it). \u00a0Ordered the french onion dumplings, kobe beef sliders, lobster roll, red snapper tacos, beef wellington and shrimp & grits. \u00a0So the ambiance was definitely 5 stars, the service 5 stars, and the food while overall was delicious was somewhat inconsistent. \u00a0Our favorite, by far, was the kobe beef sliders, absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. \u00a0The lobster roll was also very good. \u00a0The fish tacos, while slightly spicier than I could handle, were very good. \u00a0The french onion dumplings, were good but not AMAZING as I would have expected after hearing such good things from friends. \u00a0Perhaps it was my high expectations or the fact we're french onion soup snobs...but the flavor had a tad too much of a sherry wine taste I think. \u00a0It was good, but not out of this world as I expected. \u00a0The beef wellington....I would skip it here. \u00a0For $22 the portion is rather small and the meat was pretty tough (probably b/c of the portion size and cooking time), the pastry that accompanied it however was very good. \u00a0Finally the shrimp & grits, VERY spicy. \u00a0I asked the waiter if the creole sauce that came with it was spicy and he said it wasn't too spicy, well this is obviously up to each person's spice meter, since I know I'm a wuss with spicy foods, but even my husband who loves spicy foods that it was pretty hot. \u00a0So my advice is don't order it if you know you can't handle spicy stuff because contrary to what our waiter thought it was definitely hot!! \u00a0We also ordered the donuts for dessert, which were delicious. \u00a0Overall, I'd definitely return, but would stick with the sliders section of the menu as those kobe beef sliders were insane!", "Date": "2012-01-29", "Author_Location": "Howard Beach, NY"}, {"Author": "Jeff M.", "ReviewID": "zk7tNYcYhUoWw5bfKlQxaw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pretty disappointing... For all the hype around this \"celebrity chef\" helmed establishment I felt the meal came up short, especially considering the price. The staff was quite friendly, but the service itself was very rushed. I was advised by the waitress to order 5-6 dishes for two (which I did), and was told that the service would be staggered. Not so, all 5 dishes were served within a 15 period, and dishes 1-2 & 3-4 came out simultaneously. If you really have your heart set on this place my advice would be order each dish individually. The big disappointment was the chicken & waffles. The waffle itself was disgusting, a doughy mushy mess. It actually represented the exact opposite of what a good waffle should be - a crisp exterior with a light fluffy interior. Eggo does a better job! The chicken was on the dry side and had soggy skin. Now I am not a chef nor a professional food critic, but if you can't put out a passable waffle and piece of chicken in the first place, you have no business reinventing a classic.
