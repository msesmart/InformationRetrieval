Also, make sure to have everyone in your party available because if they call you and not everyone is there, you will be skipped! If you can, avoid coming on Friday/Saturday because the wait is way longer. We sat at a table to order non-sushi items, but after dinner I would not mind sitting at the sushi bar.Ama Ebi - fresh and delicious. They did forget to give us the heads until 20 minutes later though. Uni Dinner - SO. MUCH. UNI. I would definitely recommend splitting this as there is way too much uni for one person! It was really good though and a must get for uni lovers. I am a little disappointed that they charge extra for seaweed that is served in plastic, but i'll get over it. It comes with a side of sashimi or tempura, just get the sashimi.Sashimi Dinner - a ton of sashimi for a low price. It is chef special so you cannot decide what is on there, but they are accommodating to things you do NOT want. It is fresh and again the price makes this definitely worth it.I usually do not write about drinks, but the green tea was actually very good.Well worth the wait! If your wait is over an hour, I would recommend walking around in little Tokyo across the street.

They give you a paper menu but you don't mark anything. You just go ahead and tell the chef what you and he is the one that keeps track of it.We had all the expensive stuff including toro, hamachi toro, amaebi, and uni along with the regular items like salmon, albacore, and yellowtail. There was no price listed so I thought I was going to get slammed with a huge bill but I paid $95 for 2 including tax and tip. It was a much cheaper than I thought it was going to be.The fish is very fresh. I would say it's one of the best sushi I've had in a while.

One specific waitress ruins the customer service experience with her urgency to get customers out so the next table can come in.

We ordered a white fish with ponzu, shrimp/veggie tempura, toro/yellowtail/yellowtail belly/salmon/Japanese snapper/halibut sushi and a spicy tuna dish.The white fish in ponzu was tiny and ok. There was nothing outstanding about this. It was kind of like a little sample for you to try.The spicy tuna was served with nori and was one of my favorites. You wrap it inside the nori and eat it like a wrap. I believe there was no mayo in this and that's why it had a nice kick at the end.The tempura was by far the best! I usually don't like tempura, but this was to die for! Lots of flavor in this one...The sushi that I ordered was VERY average. The first bite I took was of a chewy fish. To me that is a very low quality place. Fish should never be chewy! The yellowtail belly that everyone raves about about was the worst one I've tried. Yes this piece wasn't chewy, but had 0 flavor.

Sushi Gen is great for dinner, but boy is it better to go for lunch.The doors open at 11:15, and if you want to make sure you get a spot in the first seating, you have to line up outside well before 11. I've been twice and I think we had to wait the first time. The second, my awesome mom showed up at 10:20 and was first in line. Almost overkill, but we were a party of six and booth seating is limited.Lunch service is very fast, so turnover is probably pretty decent. Servers are efficient and polite but not friendly; sashimi platters must get plated before the doors open. With the size of the lunch crowd, the speed and impersonality are desirable things.The lunch menu is full of well-priced specials, most of them centered around sushi and sashimi. You also get miso soup and pickles and some silky cold tofu with every meal.The fish is obviously the main draw at Sushi Gen. I think the sashimi lunch is the most popular item. It's a great deal, with something like ten kinds of fish for $15. All fish is top quality, and there's a nice variety to the plate. The sushi deluxe is also good, with one piece each of several nigiris, along with some cucumber and tuna rolls. The deluxe combination comes with tart slurpable mozuku and an excellent salmon skin salad. If you want to go big, I recommend the uni sashimi combination--it comes with a sashimi appetizer and a whole box of creamy, briny, beautiful uni, surrounded by even more sashimi. It's a good one to split, since it's less of a budget option at $35. The only thing I'd recommend skipping is the giant clam special. It's cooked and tough and kind of weird.Sushi Gen has to be one of the best lunch spots in L.A., and it has the crowds and Yelp reviews to match.

I like to try different varieties of nigiri so I let my lucky companion finish my second piece but after a few rounds I ask for just one per order. Normally not a fan of uni as it can be very fishy but it's heavenly here... Great silky texture and subtle taste of the sea goes so well with the crispy nori delicately wrapped around the slightly salty vinegary soft warm sushi rice. Is your mouth watering yet? Mine is just recalling my dining experience.Everything was phenomenal but here were some other highlights: red snapper, unagi, raw scallops, raw sweet shrimp and sayori. For the sweet shrimp, get the heads fried and eat it all! Eyes and brains and tentacles ...

My family and I came here for dinner - ordered the sushi deluxe combination, sashimi deluxe and uni special. Uni special cost $40 and all it was was basically a larger box of uni that you can easily buy at any japanese market. With the uni special came seaweed, in just regular packets (as in those little plastic packs) - again, can buy for a much cheaper price just at a market. Out of all these combos, the uni special is the only one that comes with rice. The sushi deluxe has a lot of tuna is all I can say about that. And lastly, for the sushi deluxe combination -- I guess their sushi is pretty fresh but so are all the other sushi restaurants that I have tried in little tokyo (Oomasa, sushi enya etc.). Basically, one piece of unagi, tamago, snapper, tuna, fatty tuna, ika (actually can't remember the rest but it wasn't that much). I'm surprised they didn't have salmon though in the sushi combination. Tempura that came with the combo was no good. Miso soup too salty. Finally, the reason I gave it only one star was because of the service. My family and I were celebrating Mother's day a week in advance (to avoid all the full restaurants and whatnot). We had gotten to the restaurant at 5 pm, 30 minutes before they opened for dinner. We waited these 30 minutes to finally be ushered in around 5:35. We noticed that the guest immediately in front of us had been in the line alone but received a seat at a table waiting for 2. My family and I had been waiting on one more person of our party to arrive as they were caught in traffic coming to LA from the OC. So, the rest of us got a seat first and ordered in advance. However, when the last member of our party arrived, Sushi gen refused to let him have a seat at our table stating that all guests must have been present when seated. We had gotten to the restaurant early at 5pm just to be early enough to get a seat, knowing they had long lines. And now they were refusing our last member to eat all the food that we had ordered. We had already ordered more than $200 worth of food too. Not only that, when we asked if our last member could just have a seat, they threatened us to leave the restaurant within 10 minutes. It's understandable if the guest in front of us in line had also been refused a seat for not having all members in their party present before being seated - however, since they were ALLOWED to sit, we only thought it was ok for the last member of our party to be a few minutes late. The manager (I believe his name was James?) was rude when handling the matter, asking us to leave the restaurant in 10 minutes. With more than $200 of sushi on the table, we were not allowed to finish eating at a comfortable pace. Basically, our last party member had to drive an hour to get to Little Tokyo only to be kicked out within a few minutes without having enjoyed this meal.Honestly, I don't know why they have such high ratings. When you have to pay $3 for parking despite having validation, having to wait so long for a table, this place is overrated. Terrible service, not spectacular food. Why should anyone even come to this place...There's so many sushi places around the same area with far better service and quality of sushi.

So why the need for a review? I've been coming here for lunch every Monday without a fail. I've always wanted that one spot that I can consider myself a regular at and I've finally found the place! The wait always varies but I've never sat right away. Shortest I've waited is 5 minutes and the longest is about 25 minutes. I usually get a Lavazza cappuccino and cronuts from Frances which is a couple stores down while I wait. I recommend getting there at 12:00 (after the first rush) or around 1:30? I think I've had the best luck at those times.Service is consistently good. They can get backed up on busy days but can you blame them?? Lunch is chaotic due to the amazing 15$ specials they offer. The servers do what they need to do. Take drink and food order, deliver the food, refill drinks, drop check. The food comes out slowly once in awhile and comes out lightning fast some days. We got our food within five minutes today. For two people, I would recommend one sushi deluxe and one sashimi deluxe combo. Or you can do what we did today and order a sashimi deluxe, sushi deluxe, and chirashi bowl and pig out! I think we're going to try ordering a $30 sashimi deluxe special next week and one sushi deluxe and see how that goes. If you ever have room for more, try ordering the snapper sushi and engawa sushi a la carte. If you have some money to spend, try the omakase at the bar as well. I believe it was about $100 per person and they give you the best fish of the night. It was well worth it-- comparable to omakase at Sushi Zo or Sasabune. Pretty awesome! One thing I do want to mention is that I do wish the sushi menu had prices listed for their a la carte items. The prices for certain items can be exorbitant!

The fish is so fresh and seriously melts in your mouth, ESPECIALLY the toro. This was my very time having toro and it was love at first bite. I can't get over how heavenly the toro is.

I wish there was a piece of Salmon in there, but there wasn't. Not too much wasabi or rice in the nigiri which was good.

My bf took me here and all I gotta say is CRAVINGS BEYOND SATISFIED END OF STORY. Coming from OC there wasn't too much traffic we arrived around 10:45AM and there was already a long line out the door. The restaurant is located in the Honda Plaza, validated parking is $3 for 2 hours, but if you're like us and feel like exploring little tokyo more and walking a bit to the japanese american museum then parking is $9 for all day which isn't bad. The anticipation and hunger standing in line was killing me as we waited til 11:30 for Sushi Gen to open!The restaurant is big yet small at the same time. It's big in the sense that there are 2 huge kitchens (makes sense w/ the amount of ppl they gotta feed). The inside makes me feel like I'm in Japan. The sushi bar seating is really clean and there are about 8 chefs working that section. There weren't too many tables which is why the restaurant is a bit small, hence the long lines.The service was really fast here, but not pushy. The waitresses were really friendly and helped us on deciding what to order since it was our first time. FYI the a la carte sushi/sashimi menu has no pricing you gotta ask for it. Right when we sat down we were given miso soup, pickled cabbage appetizer, and some sort of marinated tofu. THE TOFU WAS SOOOO SOOO GOOD! Tastes very house made and fresh.$15 Sashimi Lunch Special - Had to order this since it's their most raved about/popular menu item. Definitely best $15 you'll ever spend! There were thick cuts of sashimi along w/ other mixtures like spicy tuna, a piece of baked salmon terriyaki, jello, and some sort of marinated fish in brown sauce. The tuna was delish and very tender. My bf said it was comparable to the sushi places he had in Hawaii which were really good$18 salmon terriyaki combo - comes w/ a sashimi appetizer! BEST LUNCH COMBO EVER!! Where can you go that gives you a big nice piece of grilled salmon terriyaki w/ potato salad, cabage salad, miso soup, rice AND SASHIMI APPETIZER!? I honestly think this was better than the $15 sashimi lunch special. The terriyaki sauce was great, not overly sweet (but make sure you ask to put the sauces on the side like I did or else your meal will come out drenched in sauce) They do use thousand island dressing for the salad which I didn't really care for. The potato salad was creamy and gooooood. The sashimi appetizer came w/ yellowtail, seaweed, and tuna which were the same big thick cuts as the $15 sashimi lunch special.A LA CARTE SUSHI:Halibut - was about $9 for 2 pieces. The cuts of sushi were perfect. If you've ever watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi on Netflix you'll love Sushi Gen. The rice here is made just like in the documentary!! Omg best white rice I have ever eaten. Normally the rice that comes w/ the nigiri is either too dry, flavorless, or I don't care for it. However at sushi gen the rice is beyond perfect. The halibut tasted great w/ ponzu & wasabi sauceFresh Water Eel - I think this was around $8 for 2 pieces. By far the best Eel I've had. Almost wish I had ordered their Eel lunch bowl after eating this. There were nice big thick cuts of eel atop the rice. The sauce was not overpowering either and the nigiri wasn't drenched in sauce which is a good thing. The eel was tender and meaty.Definitely worth the drive up here to try the sushi. FYI my bf & I noticed after we were done eating (bout 12pm) that there wasn't too long of a line anymore.

I remember my dad chatting with the sushi chef and asking for a recommendation and the sushi chef plopped down two pieces of engawa that were lightly salted and sprinkled with lemon juice. I was familiar with sushi but had never had halibut fin before. I took a bite of that chewy but crisp slice of fish and I swear my whole universe stopped. I think that was the exact moment I realized how much i loved food as well. Claudibee the foodie was born! Fast forward 8 years, I was super excited to return to my childhood go-to sushi joint. And sidenote: for some reason, my dad and I never went back to Sushi Gen after my foodie birthday (I think we began exploring new sushi places?). My friend and I went 30 min before it opened to avoid the ridiculous lines and were promptly seated. I let me friend do the ordering (with the exception of engawa and kanpachi) and he chose sweet shrimp and yellowtail, hamachi collar, a beef dish, and salmon skin salad.MY THOUGHTS++ ENGAWA: i was hoping for an epiphany again but no fireworks this time. :(++ The sushi was better than average and nicely cut. However, I feel that there are many sushi joints out there that have similar good quality fish without the long wait and have better quality fish for the same price.++ the beef teriyaki (and other dishes) was (were) expensive and average. Why!?Perhaps my palate has matured over the years (or maybe my friend's choice in dishes isn't my cup of tea), but Sushi Gen no longer possesses that WOW factor it did for me in the past.Anyways, Sushi Gen is one of those sushi places where you must go at least once if you're a sushi lover. If I end up there again, I probably wasn't the one who suggested going there. I hate waiting in lines for food. :TBUT DO TRY THE ENGAWA!! Ask them to lemon and salt it.

At that price, I'd rather go to Sushi Zo.The only time I sit at the table here is for lunch. Offering a wide variety of sashimi, grilled salmon, unagi, minced toro, and sometimes spicy tuna, the sashimi lunch is a great deal at $15. It also comes with tofu, pickled vegetables, miso soup, and a bowl of rice. I have noticed that the fish is not as fresh as the fish at the bar, so I assume this is a way for Sushi Gen to profit on the fish that has sat a few days at the bar. The fish is still of decent quality though. The clam special, baked giant clam and mushrooms on top of lemon slices, is also good.If you're looking for a true high end sushi experience, Sushi Gen is not the right choice. However, the sashimi lunch truly is a great deal if you're looking for your sushi fix. You should prepare to wait in line for about 30 minutes though.

The amount of love and dedication that goes into every cut of the fish is noticeable when you put the food in your mouth. When you order the Sweet Shrimp, you have an option to deep fry the head or use the head for miso soup. Since the restaurant is located in the complex, you can go ahead and park in their parking lot.

After the long wait, we ordered around 6 different dinner sets including the sashimi dinner, teriyaki dinner, uni dinner, chirashi deluxe, and other side items such as the fish chin, California rolls, and sweet shrimp sashimi. I personally was not too fond of our waitress. After ordering a decent amount for a family, we told her that she didn't give us enough rice, in which she doubted us, and started counting the number of rice bowls on our table (note: each dinner set comes with a bowl of rice), then pointed to my baby cousin and said he had that extra bowl of rice when really that was an extra bowl we had asked for the baby and put rice into it. Really?! Come on, how much can cooked rice be? After we explained, she reluctantly brought out snore howl of white rice for us, but the overall experience just wasn't very pleasant. I got for myself the sweet shrimp sashimi and the sashimi dinner, in which I didn't entirely love. For $26, the sashimi dinner did not offer enough fresh fish pieces, but instead, around half of the tray was filled with cooked seaweed, a chunk of spicy tuna and another chunk of some other ground fish mush. If I asked for sashimi dinner, I really am not expecting blobs of minced fish on my plate. The sweet shrimp sashimi on the other hand was just ok. It didn't taste that fresh and the shrimp was a lot smaller compared to what other Japanese restaurants normally serve you. We asked for our shrimp heads to be cooked into a soup, and that soup was probably my favorite part of the entire dinner. Since we were celebrating my uncles bday, we received a big scoop of free green tea ice cream which was nice. Overall, the bill for our family came out to $406 with tips, which was why I expected more out of the service instead of witnessing accusation and rice counting. Oh, and I wasn't happy about the fact that they charge $1 extra for each tiny plate of ginger upon not giving you any with the sashimi or rolls. Really?!

Luckily, we only waited ten minutes even when they told us that the wait would be twenty.Was the sushi as good as everyone says? That would be a resounding YES. Four stars for the sushi. We ordered the fatty tuna (toro), albacore that was topped with shaved ginger and thin slices of green onion, Japanese red snapper that was topped with this green floral-tasting mixture that I did not appreciate at all, salmon and scallops. The front runners were the toro and albacore for sure. Behind the pack were the rolls and karaage we ordered, unfortunately. Three stars for the spicy tuna and eel and avocado rolls. As cute as the small cut rolls were, I couldn't taste what they were filled with. Being a lover a fried chicken, I felt naturally compelled to order the karaage. However, I'm not used to how they prepare it at Sushi Gen. The chicken meat was rolled into big balls (think meatball) and breaded and served with a lemon. So instead of the nice crunchy texture that you would expect from strips of karaage, you get a chicken ball without the spicy mayo dipping sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was still yummy, just not what I expected when I ordered their \"fried chicken.\" Another four stars for the service. It's also as good as everyone says. Our drinks were topped off, the server came by numerous times asking if we needed anything and our food was served with lightning speed. We even got a cup of green tea ice cream with a candle since I told them that it was my friend's birthday.Overall, it's three and a half stars rounded up to four for Sushi Gen for me.

I've been eating at this place since I was 10 and the quality has never dipped below perfection. The quality of the fish is beyond, and I can personally assure you Yelpers of this fact because my dad supplies the fish the company who supplies Sushi Gen. Yes I know that was complicated, but they only order the highest quality of fish for their restaurant. If you can't afford to eat at the bar, I highly recommend you go for their lunch special. For $15 you get their sashimi special which is still grade A and perfectly filling. The only downside is that no matter what day of the week, you're bound to wait. But if you can spend that $40-50 a person for lunch, go to the bar and you probably won't have to wait. They also have an uni lunch special for $30 if you're into that!My recommendation, skip the rolls and go for either the nigiri or the sashimi. It's a shame to waste the fish in a roll. Their tempura is really good as well, very thin batter which makes for the perfect crisp. And if you love miso soup, their clam miso soup is soo tasty!

The rice is well seasoned and the fish is fresh and generously cut. What I really appreciate about this place is their salmon. It is not the usual creamy orange commercial farm salmon. This salmon is dark pink and it's wild caught, but still flavorful. They have a dinner set that is reasonably priced. For $26 you get a salad and soup starter as well as a nigiri sushi set. Omakase is going to cost you a pretty penny, depending what you get. You can also make requests of what you want as well. Of course I had to order sweet shrimp, which comes with the nigiri as well as the freshly deep fried head. The uni (sea urchin) is sweet, mildly salty, and creamy without any hint of metallic taste (which is a sign of age or lack of freshness). Needless to say, I was very happy and full after $80.Sushi Gen's claim to fame I have to say is their sashimi lunch special on the weekdays. For $15, you get a large plate of various cuts of fish, some poke and other items. You also get some appetizers as well, and I was served some pickled veggies, seasoned silken tofu, and a miso soup.

Win...The place is really lively, yet despite the loads of people, the sushi chefs are pretty attentive to the customers and make your sushi soon after you order.The fish quality is very fresh, and the textures are quite nice. The sushi rice was also well made. The dab of wasabi under the fish and the other toppings for some of the orders went well with our nigiri. My favorites were the tuna (all of them), uni, salmon, and scallop. The yellowtail fin was quite chewy, and was very tough to eat. (Not something I was used to.) I also ordered both the Spanish mackerel and the Japanese mackerel to check out the differences. Apart from slight differences in texture, nothing much else. After the dinner, I felt like it was a wasted comparison as they were both good - but in the end, I just ordered lots of mackerel...My main gripe with the place was the amount we paid. Not so much about how much, as we ordered quite a bit. But rather, I was really annoyed that we had no idea how much every order of nigiri cost when we ordered them! The paper slip with all the options had no pricing, and our receipt didn't even break it down for us! Such a trap... Be very weary the next time you come here, and order selectively.

Okay, not a problem. So I put my name down for four people. Waited outside for almost an hour and go back in asking how much longer the wait would be for Candy, the table for four. The guy tells me there are three more people in front of me and that I would be seated pretty soon. So cool, I don't mind waiting for sushi that is going to be amazing! Btw, this is my first time here and we drove an hour just to come eat here.Anyway, the host comes out and calls my name, get super excited cus it's freezing and we were starving. The host doesn't even walk us to the table, but instead points at the table we're being seated at. We walk up to the table and the busboy was still cleaning the table so we stand their for a few awkward minutes. Then the busboy looked confused and the host walked over and told us that our table was the clean one in front of us (it was a two seater). I stare back at him and was like, \"there are four of us...\" so we all walk back to the front where the host station is and the stupid four eye harry potter guy put me down for two people. I confronted him and said that I said four and even repeated it two or even three times!! He then said with major attitude, \"well I heard two.\" I was super annoyed at this point, not because they got the number of people wrong, but he was EXTREMELY RUDE!! And he even saw that I came in with three other people, my bf and his two little sisters. Like seriously?! Get better glasses you mofo. I wanted to punch him. He made us wait another 20 minutes and eventually sat us next to the kitchen door. It was a horrible seating, I'm pretty sure he sat us there on purpose. At this point I was only just annoyed, but later on this four eye harry potter wannabe guy ruins our dinner and our night.Don't get me wrong, the waitresses and busboys were pretty nice.My table ordered...Shrimp Tempura - not the best I had, very average. It's crispy on the outside but soggy on the insidecold tofu - pretty good, it's cold tofu (what could go wrong?)butter salmon with sashimi combo - salmon was good (not dry), but the sashimi looked and tasted like left over sashimisalmon - pretty goodfried calimari - not good, don't get this\"live\" sweet shrimp - DISGUSTING!! IT WAS FROZEN AND NOT FRESH!!So here's where I started to get pissed off. This is what I mainly came here for, live sweet shrimp. LIVE. I was excited when I received my sweet shrimp sashimi (comes in three pieces btw.) because apparently they have scrumptious sweet shrimp. I look at it when it arrives and it looked milky and not clear and fresh like how live shrimp is suppose to look. I take a bite out of it and omgosh, it was so mushy and slimey like it was frozen for couple of days then defrosted. So gross, worst sweet shrimp I've ever had. I immediately called the waitress and told her to take it back (nicely, of course). Then bam! Here's the good part. The annoying four eye host came by our table and was like,him: what's wrong with itme: well it's not live for onehim: well it's not shrimp season so we don't have any live shrimpwth, that's the first I've heard of it not being \"shrimp season\"me: well it says LIVE sweet shrimphim: well there's no live shrimp right nowme: then you shouldn't be selling \"live\" sweet shrimp to customer, especially if they're paying more than $10 per piece of shrimp. And plus, I called last week asking if you guys had any live shrimp and the person said yeshim: that's not possible, there's only two guys that answers the phone, me and the other guy... so I'm here thinking (blanking out cus I didn't want to be mean), are you calling me a liar... plus a girl picked up when I asked...him: what do you want me to do thenme: if you guys have live shrimp I'd love to have that, but since you guys don't could you please return it pleasehe gets mad, rolls his eyes, and promptly walks awaySo I was pretty pissed at this point from this little dispute between me and the host. My boyfriend was pretty mad and was ready to punch the guy in the face, but he sat their quietly so that I could handle it.So yeah, I had a pretty horrible experience here because of the faggot host and the unfresh sashimi. If you love sashimi, go to hama sushi. They're not the best quality, but at least their not live sweet shrimp doesn't taste slimey and gross like Sushi Gen, and only at the fraction of the price!I never put a price on good quality food, but if you're serving me shit at the same price of a top quality restaurant. You can suck my \"live sweet shrimp\"!Anyway, I would have given this place maybe a 3 or 4, but because of the RUDE four eye host. I will never, ever come here again.

I even witnessed one yelling at a busser for not cleaning a table quickly enough, which I thought was unnecessary.The bill was $153 (pre-tax and tip) for our party of four, which isn't tooooo bad for fresh and quality sushi.

It's like that sports prospect that every team knows is really good, but most teams pass on drafting due to personality issues. Likewise, Sushi-Gen has quality sushi at a reasonable price, but everyone from the host to the servers are pretty much dickbutts, which definitely detracts from an otherwise great sushi/sashimi experience. The wife and I carpool as much as possible and she works near Little Tokyo so we actually got to Sushi-Gen before they even opened on a weeknight, yet already there was a mob of people. Upon opening their doors it felt like being at Walmart for Black Friday because people were shoving and shit to be seated. Seriously, they need to take a page from other busy Japanese restaurants like Shin Sen Gumi Yakitori in Gardena or the Shabu Shabu House in the Japanese Village Mall by having a sign-in wait list. Anyways, once we were seated at our table, the wife and I ordered an overpriced sea cucumber appetizer that was pretty much flavorless. For $8 we were definitely underwhelmed. So yea, fuck the sea cucumber! Next, the gluttons inside us had us ordering two, that's right count 'em, two sashimi deluxes ($35 each) for dinner. Seriously, what the fuck were we thinking? The portions were humongous and we were unable to finish everything... then again not everything tasted good.The problem with Sushi-Gen is that they have no descriptions by their menu items and the servers don't really explain shit. What makes things worse is that there is no fucking AT&T reception inside the restaurant so I couldn't log onto Yelp, which would have averted the disaster of ordering too much shit. I know that they say hindsight is 20/20, but I should have done a little more research before coming. So onto the sashimi deluxe... When one thinks sashimi, one thinks raw fish, yet the sashimi deluxe also came with a piece of tamago (egg omelet slice), a piece of overcooked salmon, and some weird soy sauce marinated tuna side. I guess deluxe at Sushi-Gen must mean cooked leftovers. Chikusho!As for the actual sashimi on the plate, it consisted of slices of toro (fatty tuna), maguro (tuna), salmon, mackerel, yellowtail, octopus, squid, mirugai (geoduck), cubes of leftover tuna, a heap of some mysterious white fish in a ginger marinade, two globs of marinated tuna (spicy and non-spicy) and shrimp. While I loved the toro, maguro, salmon, and shrimp, the octopus and squid were dry and aside from the spicy tuna marinade, the other items just took up space. Regardless, for $35 it is a good bargain and the sashimi slices were nice and thick. However, if you come with a party of two, just order one sashimi deluxe. Usually when you go to a \"real\" Japanese restaurant and not one run by Koreans or Chinese people, the service is awesome. Even within Little Tokyo, at other sushi places like Hama and Komasa, I feel like they want me at the restaurant despite the \"credit card rules\" signs. However, at Sushi-Gen, not only was there a lack of geniality, the service was sub-par and what fucking pissed me off was they charged an extra $1 for ginger. I was surprised that they didn't charge me extra for soy sauce and wasabi, stingy fucktards. Maybe if we were in Japan I would have been more forgiving, but when even Yoshinoya does not charge for goddamn ginger, the last thing I expected was to be nickeled and dimed at Sushi-Gen. At the end of the day, the quality of most of the sashimi was good enough to warrant a return visit. However, I will not be ordering the sashimi deluxe ever again because I expect just sashimi when I order sashimi. Oh yea, and that hot tea? It's $1.50. At least they don't charge for refills. --------------------------------------------------\u00ad-----Pictures:Sashimi Deluxe bit.ly/14KHXljSea Cucumber bit.ly/Y3uLRp", "Date": "2013-04-05", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Ran J.", "ReviewID": "BzOSoly3vPoeywpgPzDi1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I came into Sushi Gen on a Thursday at 12:30 pm and was seated after half an hour, which was not bad at all, considering how long I've had to wait at other places.

Obviously food should be at the top of the list. However, price, service, and impression rank as important factors as well. Sushi Gen receives my stamp of approval because it has a well-rounded mixture of all the things that I think make for a great restaurant. So without ado, I shall begin an account of my experience.The Saturday night started out with a bit of parking trouble, as the private parking lot was filled. However, I was able to quickly find some on-street parking. Once at the door, we found that the line was sizable: 1.5 hrs for a table. However, the sushi bar came with only a 45 minute wait. Before, people start criticizing about this point, let me clarify the nature of supply and demand. When you come to a popular restaurant (ie. ranked 4.5 on Yelp), you expect that it will be busy. So then, it should follow that there should be no reason to complain about a long wait. Think of it as the price of admission. And for me, the wait was definitely worthwhile. And having said that, the sushi bar, which I ended up choosing, was by far the more desirable choice. There is definitely a sense of magic when you're right up close to the sushi chefs, and are able to see their culinary magic and knife skills. Now for the food. To put things short, the sushi was excellent, amongst the best I've had, even when compared to places that charge $140+ per person. Though before I start however, I must make a disclaimer that my assessment is based solely on the sushi menu, as the dinner menu was not available at the sushi bar. But to qualify the validity of my statements, it is my belief that the sushi should also be the star, not the cooked dishes. Speaking of benchmarks for excellence, one of the key plates I order is called Uni (Sea Urchin). This delicacy is very fresh-dependent: one can tell very immediately if the Uni has been sitting around in a refrigerator for a while. Here, the Uni was just perfect. Not bitter, slightly sweet, just as it should be. The texture was perfect, and the presentation was immaculate. It simply melts in the mouth. Once I had tasted the Uni, I knew I was in for a treat. The next dish, which I have really only tasted at one other restaurant, was the Monkfish Liver. It was served as an appetizer in some sort of soy-sauce-based sauce with spices. I think we oftentimes expect fish liver to have an oily and salty consistency to it. However, such was not the case for the Monkfish Liver here. The combination of product and spice was just perfect, lending to a savory flavor with just the right amount of acidity to open up the dish and provide a refreshing aftertaste. To clear the palate, the sushi chefs followed up with some seaweed which was meant to be dipped in the same sauce. Other sushi we tried were Sweet Shrimp, Abalone, Yellowtail, Half Beak (needle fish), Sardine, Spanish Mackerel, Scallop, Herring Roe, Japanese Snapper. Amongst these, there was definitely a standout. The Half Beak (Needle Fish) was recommended by the sushi chef, and ended up being one of the most delicious plates I've ever tried. I don't know if it was the subtle vinegar/wasabi flavoring, or whether it was simply a fresh cut of fish, but the flavors just seemed to explode in my mouth. I have never tasted anything quite like it. This is a MUST TRY sushi. Other notable include the Herring Roe (Herring Caviar), which unlike the Flying fish roe (flying fish eggs) that people so often see, do not taste salty and bitter. This dish was served as single piece. The flavor was subtle and understated. No bitterness or saltiness. Just the slightest hint of sweetness. This was the best Fish Roe I have had. At end of the day, the bill came out to $104 + tax/tip for 2 people. Given that prices were not published on the menus, I was a bit shocked at how cheap this all was. However, some people will complain that you can get $2 plates at your local rotary sushi bar. However, those who complain simply do not know that the mark of good sushi is that is does not need much help from spices, especially that horrid \"spicy mayo\" which is so popular in these cheap sushi joints. I think ~$50/person for a meal like this is a good bargain, especially given the near-instant service of being at the bar.Once you experience this you will never go back, and you will always crave these extremely fresh cuts of fish. Do yourself a favor. Go ahead and try this place out.

It is very oily tasting and the pieces I received were soggy on the bottom. That's never happened to me for any tempura I've ever ordered in my life so that was very disappointing.

Usually, sushi joints will have certain selections that are just amazing and it almost forces you to get seconds, thirds, or fourths of it, but I felt none of that here. Their Tempura was excellent, though. The Sashimi Dinner Combination was alright and very nicely presented, but yes, it bothers me still that nothing stood out. It's all quality stuff though, regardless.SERVICEThe service was alright. They could have been better, but still not worthy of any complaints from me. AMBIENCESo this is where I get a little nit-picky (as if I haven't been already). Everything is CLEAN and looks like a legit fancy restaurant almost. I just really prefer my sushi joints to be cozy and almost intimate. I felt like this was a nicer and Japanese version of a Korean sushi house where there's like a ton of sushi chefs and it is a relatively larger restaurant than what I've come to like. Personally, I like that personal experience where that sushi chef remembers you and shit like that. There's two or three or maybe even four maximum making everyone's sushi. I like it when sushi chefs remember my likes, dislikes, how much I eat, makes good conversation or at least acknowledges my existence almost as if I'm the only one there. If I ever became a regular here, that could never happen. Not at a place like this. That's why it's a four star place to me.

But then we were placed on the BOTTOM of the list which was rude to say the least. We then waited another 30 mins indoors, and re-checked the waiting list to be told AGAIN that we had already been called...So now we were paying close attention. We observed the host telling at least 5 parties that their name had already been called and skipped. This was responded with much confusion and shaking heads. We then listened as the male hosts stepped outside and called guest names... Ever so softly. Wow, man up! So incompetent. No wonder guests waiting indoors did not hear their names. Anyway, we were starving by the time we were finally seated and ordered immediately. I had the sashimi deluxe for $35 along with sushi rice and miso soup. The sashimi was excellent quality but the selections were tragically boring. There was like 6-8 pieces each of tuna and yellowtail. Definitely should have checked Yelp photos before choosing this place. There was even minced tuna, cubes of reject tuna parts, shredded imitation crab, jello slices - like imitation squid, and an extremely dry chunk of salmon. Totally unnecessary and bad tasting decorations. My friend's teriyaki salmon was overcooked as well. Baking tender, juicy salmon is incredibly easy. What a sad, sad kitchen. On a postive note, I enjoyed the silky melt-in-your-mouth toro and buttery ankimo appetizer. \u00a0Overall, the sashimi was very fresh and quite delicious, but the fish selections were overly safe and repetitive.

I have lived in Japan for about a year and while my stay in Tokyo and varies places in different parts of Japan, I have tried at the most famous Sushi restaurants all over Japan. I'm currently living in Socal and one of the most difficult thing living here was that I could not eat anywhere that really satisfied myself fully eating out at a sushi restaurant. In Japan, most high end Sushi restaurants have this epic type of atmosphere that just makes you go \"Oh wow... O man... O no way... WOW!! ... ooooooo my.... this is it..... WOOhooo\" every time the chef prepares the sushi. I have not felt this in any restaurant outside of Japan.Now talking about Sushi-Gen... I would proudly say this is my favorite Japanese sushi place in the country. As matter of a fact, outside of Japan. It does not have the most high end luxury sushi vibe, nor the presentation of food that makes the place feel that great. But I have to say for its price, sushi (sashimi, rice) grade level, chef's preparation skill, it is definitely bang for buck.1. I have tried so many high end, 4.5+ review, sushi restaurants over Socal, and I have to say no place beats Sushi-gen.2. The sashimi used in Sushi-gen is what a sashimi should taste like which you cannot find any other restaurants around that have this much complex flavor in otoro, maguro, uni, amaebi, kanpachi, hamachi.3. The rice used in Sushi-gen is again how the authentic high grade level sushi should have. The rice is cooked perfectly, perfect temperature when prepared as sushi, sticky, and elastic like it should be. You can feel every drop of the rice when you chew the sushi.4. The vibe is not the super high end sushi like but it is very much similar to how bargain real sushi shops in Ginza, Tokyo, taste like. It is the taste of $300 sushi but at a affordable price without the extra high end atmosphere and just going for the quality of the food itself.5. Everything in the menu is great but the real great stuff is not the \"COMBO\" or any of that. It is many times written in Japanese menu and you simply have to ask for it since many are seasonal items. So regulars and first timers that order Combo menu that leaves yelp review can be easily distinguished from the food thats on their table.6. For the money and quality, Sushi-gen cannot be beat and really sometimes I don't know how they make profit with the quality of the sashimi they offer for such a reasonable price. It makes every other high end wanna be Japanese Sushi shop look like they are ripping people off with low end sushi that is dressed like high end sushi.If you want the best tasting, (same sushi you would expect from a famous shop in Japan), come to Sushi-Gen. You will not be disappointed.Hence I like to proudly say that I come to Sushi gen every week because this place is bargain and I know I cannot have sushi or sashimi this quality even when I'm paying 2x the price of the Sushi-Gen. I really recommend sushi-gen, and give yourself a shot by orderings things not on the combo menu but the seasonal items that you ask \"what is the best thing to eat right now?\" The chef, waiter, waitress will gladly guide you to the right path.

What you get is decent ambiance, similar to wherever your favorite sushi restaurant is, with extremely fresh and high quality fish at reasonable prices. After a 20 minute wait at lunchtime, which was much better than I expected, I sat at the Sushi Bar. I ordered Salmon, Sweet Shrimp, Bluefin Toro, Yellow Tail, Eel and Octopus, along with the Miso Soup and Green Tea.A couple of quick measures for a decent sushi place: Fresh warm and wet napkin to refresh yourself and the number of grades of toro they carry. The napkin was not warmed, but was available and they only carried one or two grades of toro.The Miso soup was much fresher than most restaurants -- not the ultra top tier but top of very good. The Salmon nigiri was pedestrian. You'd probably get the same quality where ever you normally eat sushi. The Bluefin Toro was as good as many places. The Sweet Shrimp and Yellow Tail were simply in another category. Exceptionally fresh and tasty. The Octopus was excellent and the eel was more refined than I expected.The bill was very reasonable. (At a higher end place you can go through several hundred dollars.) There are no fancy rolls and the wine and beer menu is very similar to wherever you've eaten before. What sets Sushi Gen apart is that for the money you spend, you get exceptionally high quality sushi.

None of us had ever been and we had all wanted to eat there, so this was our chance.We were seated in the dining area after a twenty minute wait, and we proceeded to order the following:Deluxe Sashimi PlatterA nice assortment of sashimi, most of which I thought were good. Everything was fresh and enjoyable, but only a couple were outstanding in my opinion.Chicken Teriyaki w/ TempuraMy wife ordered this since she's pregnant and can't eat much raw fish (though she did have a couple pieces). Nothing extraordinary about the teriyaki, but it was better than most places I've had it.Sushi a la carteNow you can hate me all you want, but being such a carbs person, I prefer sushi over sashimi; I just need that little bit of rice with the fish to complete the experience. So I loved the sushi more than the sashimi. The classics that I usually get (Sake, Hamachi, Unagi, and Albacore) were all as good as or better than any I've had in the past, but the two that rocked my world were the Yellowtail Belly and the Toro. I had never had YB before, and now I don't think I can ever go back to just Yellowtail. And the Toro... well, I've had this before at other restaurants, but I was never wowed by it. Not so anymore! The Toro here was mind-blowingly rich and buttery; my brother and I could not eat just one, so we ended up ordering a few more at the end of our meal. Holy cow.I also tried Oyster sushi for the first time (which I wasn't a huge fan of) and the Sea Eel (good). The Uni was also really good, but I've actually had better.In the end, had it not been for the Yellowtail Belly and Toro, I think I would have just been content with my meal. I do have to say though... next time I come, I will have to eat at the bar, since I know it's a whole difference experience when you're eating sushi. And maybe then I'll be able to give them 5 stars.

Here are a few: If you...1. love fresh quality fish enough to invest 40+ minutes of your time during lunch rush hours2. haven't been diagnosed with claustrophobia within the last 6 months3. don't mind making your wallet cry from paying up some big $$4. are a stingy college student like me and find yourself in a position where someone else is generously covering the bill 5. are mentally prepared to tolerate some tense on-the-edge lunch goers who have yet to be seated or6. have no problem fighting for a parking spot with other desperate drivers then this is the place for you. Fortunately, my dad decided to treat us all out for a nice lunch over at the sushi bar (spoiled child I know), so despite all the inconveniences trying to secure a spot, our family had a fun and yummy bonding experience over some sushi. :) My favorites were probably the yellowtail and the toro. The yellowtail was mild in flavor and slightly chewy; the toro was a melt-in-your-mouth sort of sensation. Both highly recommended. I love salmon so the salmon was just heavenly, the albacore was refreshing, and the halibut was chewy in texture, but just as lovely as the rest. Tuna was standard, and the fresh water eel was phenomenal, just because the fish sort of broke apart in your mouth as you bit into it. I liked the sweet shrimp because of its unusual sticky and moist texture, but some people may not like it because of this quality. We were told that we could have the shrimp heads either fried or in miso soup, and I opted for the fried version; who would have known that fried shrimp head is better than calamari? NOM! Think crispy shrimp chips. I think the reason why this experience was so fun was because our sushi chef, Toyo, was super entertaining. You could tell he enjoyed his profession and that passion transfers into the food, which makes the food taste that much better. In essence, when you come here, you pay for not only quality of the food but for the quality of your eating experience. Will be back again, except to try that lunch special everyone is raving about! Notes: * the meal ended up a good ~60.00 per person including tax and tip! It wasn't cheap.* another diner told me that should I get a chance, I should try the red snapper because it's THAT good. will try it out next time. *service: super efficient. The staff may ask you want you'd like (drinks, food) and they follow through. * you can ask that sushi be made without the wasabi if you like to take your spice as you dip the fish into some soy sauce. * you will never be able to get a sushi roll with the rice on the outside. the chefs consider that an abomination.

Most of the sashimi tastes awesome especially that baby yellowtail that had a light pink texture to it. \u00a0I thought I wasn't going to be full with just sashimi, so I ordered some rice just in case. And ordered some fried chicken also just in case. My stomach wasn't that full but very satisfied. The bill came out to be almost $80 with tax and tip. Pricey but well worth. Highly recommended sushi joint to all the sushi lovers out there looking for some very delish yummy goodness. Parking is free with 2 hours validation. Come there early to get good parking.

Got there in about 20 minutes and when I went to get my food, it seems like they haven't even started the order yet so waited another 15 minutes to get my order. The fish was fresh like always and very good value for the price. The one problem I had with it and why I took off a star is the siZe of their container is very small. So for the sushi deluxe, the sushi pieces were packed up tight like a can of sardines. Good rice for sushi should be loosely packed and breaks apart easily once you put it in you mouth but the rice was too tightly packed. \u00a0Also different pieces of sushi was touching and overlapping each other making flavors mixed up. The salmon salad also didn't have any taste and was not as good as when I had it in the restaurant. Overall ill probably still keep getting to go orders but will probably stick with the sashimi lunch instead of getting the sushi.

The experience made those really gruff waitstaff in Chinese restaurants (where you go for the excellent food not the service) seem like angels, because at least those servers don't tell you \"WE JUST WANT YOU TO LEAVE\" so they can make more money. The fish is fine and service is fine, so I have nothing to say about that -- but you can get delicious sashimi/sushi at numerous other places in Little Tokyo where we will be going now.Our party of 4 ordered a ton of food and a large bottle of sake. We were about halfway through dinner when my husband got out of work surprisingly early and we asked him to join us since Sushi Gen is (used to be) his absolute favorite, and he started speeding back from OC like a madman. Our group was at a booth where he could have easily just sat down to join us at the same table, but the host/manager rudely said he could not join -- restaurant policy \"for the past 30 years\" -- because it would add extra time to our total dining time if he came to eat. We said we weren't done eating yet anyway, and we even promised not to close our tab and not order any more food (a restaurant that doesn't want you to order more food??) so it wouldn't add more time since there was plenty of food as it was. None of that mattered because \"we just want you to leave so we can have our tables back.\" This was a Tuesday night and there wasn't even a long line, and even if there was -- since when does adding an extra mouth to help eat the existing food and drink already on the table add extra time when you're only halfway through your meal? We're not inconsiderate people and would have made sure to eat expediently if there was a line (which there wasn't). So basically, Hubby rushed back from OC for no reason, was not allowed to eat with us and instead went to eat by himself at Aburiya Toranoko while we finished up as fast as we could to get out of there like they wanted.

So we listened and walked inside. It is a pretty small place so there was a wait for a table for three. Which was fortuitous as otherwise I would never have noticed that charming little kitty in the corner. See attached photo of said kitty cat.Hot house sake is $7.50 for a \"large\" which is actually rather small, it goes pretty quickly if you have had a rough day and it goes even faster if you are sharing it with another person. The \"large\" Sapporo is $7 but at least the beer glasses are tiny so you feel like Godzilla as you drink from them, you are large and in charge.Octopus sushi: amazeballs. But everything octopus is great. It only comes with 2 pieces though so be forewarned if you are dining at a table of 3. And it is very loosely wrapped so the rice will jettison even if you are being careful.Eel avocado sushi: besides the octopus the clear best of the sushi lot. The avocado is so delicious and green you have to like it.Because of lots of sake and Sapporo you have probably hit the restroom at this point. It is back behind the sushi bar area as opposed to the table seating area. The men's is small and cramped and not extraordinarily clean, but as long as you are not dining off of the bathroom floor like one Captain Zapp Brannigan, then just get up and atom quickly.Salmon sushi: good. Made even better with wasabi. But that is one of my biggest complaints that the wasabi portions on each sushi plate were so tiny. I like it hot. Drop it like it is hot. Ghost ride the whip.

That's fine, because he got us a table in about 5 minutes and someone finally led us in. Now while I was waiting I had a grande iced chai tea latte in my hand, and I did not realize that they have a no-external-drinks policy, and when I sat down at my table I had literally one sip left in my plastic cup. All of a sudden Brian ran over, reached out for my chai tea latte, and says: \"You can't have that in here. Can I take it?\"I don't know what kind of employment training he had, but that was unacceptably rude for Japanese standards, and I honestly expected more from a famous Japanese restaurant owned by Japanese people.

I was also told to arrive on time as they do not hold tables. My friend and I arrived promptly and decided to seat at the bar. We sampled somewhere between eight and ten different kinds of sushi and not one, not a single one stood out. Not only did they not standout on the menu, they were also quite mediocre at best on our palettes. Everything had some sort of an overpowering element on it that would prevent you from tasting the actual fish or any of the stars of the sushi.

Way over hyped. \u00a0Came here last night and was surprised to see so many people standing outside waiting for their tables. You may think that's a good sign, but in my head, there was a loud \"warning\" siren blasting off. In my LA Sushi experiences, the \"crowded\" \"popular\" places never turned out to be decent. It's always the one that's small, hidden, not so crowded that offers great Sushi.And my initial thought was confirmed right away. Sushi riceWay too warm. The contrast between warm rice and cold fish was much greater than what could possibly be a harmonized fusion. It was especially bad with extra cold Uni on top. Also, the rice wasn't squeezed firmly enough, so it was quite a challenge to not make rice fall apart when I picked it up.Selections/Line-upsIt was just like any other mediocre LA Sushi joints. Meaning, very \"standard\" and nothing special. Several of my requests were turned down with \"oh we don't have that\" and I was very sad. It wasn't like I asked for something so unique and so unusual. In fact, any of those would have been offered at several of the good Sushi joints in South Bay. The chef didn't even talk about what they had that's in season or what they had that's the freshest of the day. \u00a0All he kept recommending was salmon, tuna, albacore, giant clam, halibut... you know, the \"usual.\" Oh god, can you be more boring than that?For a moment they made me happy when they said they had sardines, but it instantly became a disappointment as their sardine was vinegared. And it wasn't the good vinegared version, but it was \"the fish got old so I tossed it in vinegar for a while\" version. No delicate nice flavoring what so ever.GarnishGarnish is one of the important contribution to the Sushi. You can't just put Wasabi, ginger, Momiji Oroshi (grated Daikon and red pepper), or green onion on top of the fish and be done with it. The combination as well as amount has to be right for it to be good. Their garnishing was nothing but sloppy and not only it didn't help their sushi tastes better, but in fact, it made it worse. For example, we had oysters on the shells. Each oyster was quite small, which was fine as the size and flavor differ depending on where it was produced. \u00a0What was appalling to me was that they came with ton of Momiji Oroshi and chopped green onions on top. Oysters, especially smaller oysters, are known for their very creamy flavor and soft texture. Ton of Momiji Oroshi first killed off the flavor of nice mild creamy flavor, then the rough and hard stems of green onions just completely killed the beauty of the soft and smooth oyster texture. If the chef really cared about each ingredient's character and quality, he would have never chosen to put ton of Momiji Oroshi and chopped green onions. Chives would have gone much better as they are smaller and got less texture than green onions. Shame.At this point, I was pretty disappointed with what they had to offer, and the bill made it even worse.

The bar is very cramped but worth it.In a sushi restaurant, I look for two things: Expert fish cutting by Sushi Jedi Masters and sourcing. Sushi Gen fared well in both. As contrary as it may sound, it's not about freshness (fish can be aged) but about sourcing. In every industry, there is a pecking order - unless you have connections, the \"new guy\" isn't necessarily going to get the best stuff. Sushi Gen commands high-quality fish.I had a few pieces with overly warm rice but I overlooked it. Additionally, the service is VERY unsatisfactory but I blame this on management - the restaurant is just too busy.

Well. Considering that the line at lunch is about an hour or so of wait time, you get the sense that that piece of advice may no longer be pertinent.I lived across the street from this spot for 4 years. So you can say that I had my fair share of Sushi-Gen (pronounced with a Hard G) experiences. Let me give you the rundown.1) Sushi: SOME of their fish is fresh. Not Tsukiji market fresh, but ok. Some things that are not so amazingly fresh also happen to cost a bloody fortune here like UNI (sea urchin) and O-TORO, CHU-TORO, (Tuna). I have even had salmon here that was lackluster and a little fishy. It was honestly better at Nijiya. It's funny, because when the chefs serve it up to you, they have this little guilty look in their eyes that sort of says, \"it's not my fault, the owner makes us\", and that's probably true, while not an excuse.As you sit and order, you will notice most of the customers asking for \"Spicy Tuna Handrolls\", \"Spider Rolls\", and the like. And if you know what kind of sushi chefs rejoice in drowning their fish in mayo, siracha, etc. - you know where you're eating. 2) Why so busy? A long time ago, I heard that this place was run Japanese-style and built a great rep, excellent service and the chefs made the call on the fish. Reputations - good or bad - can last a lifetime. This one floats on it.No longer Japanese style, but perhaps owned by one - this is kind of like a Dim Sum experience without the cart ladies and MSG. It's a buffet line of pushy/shoving people, and mostly frequented by Taiwanese, Koreans and \"in the know\" Gai Jin that are ignorant enough to consider this good. Japanese stay away for the most part as the service is often sub par - meaning that the whole etiquette, and beauty of the Japanese dining experience doesn't really exist here. And of course price is relatively high unless you get one of their cheapy special lunches which many people line up for 1 hour to munch on. God knows why when they could get this from Hisa-san at Toranoko for about 15 bucks: danconiacreative.com/201\u2026First time I came here, I made the error of ordering 4-5 pieces of sushi. When the bill came, I couldn't believe it - 25 bucks! Wow. I mean, that's not too cheap for a little snack at lunch. Then the waitress came back with my credit card receipt...um...75.00, not 25!!! I could not believe it. So yah. Order the specials if you must go here at lunch.On rare occasion, some poor fool friend of mine who heard from his buds that this was somehow \"authentic\" (whatever that means), and we had to go. They all learned their lesson. And then once or twice, I convinced myself that I must of just had a bad experience here 6 times, and should try once more. On the last attempt, after dropping 200 on enough food to feed my goldfish, we went to Mako sushi just to have a better memory of the evening.Bottom line is that this place runs on hype/steam mostly from people who are used to Korean-owned fake Japanese restaurants, or faux-Japanese like Kagaya. They come here and taste something pretty close to what sushi should be. But then, it's a miserable fail in comparison with Mako just up the street. But then at Mako, you need to invest a few trips until he knows and love you. All in all, if you want a one stop wonder - try Kimagure in Pasadena.

I suggest you sit a table where you can order a more variety of food and your experience won't be tainted by the grouches behind the bar. You can't dispute that the food is excellent here.

Virginia, Shauna and me opted to seat at Sushi bar because that's how Omakase supposed to be. Just as Shauna's review, I was prepared to spend about $85 tops for this Omakase, but I guess we're heavy eaters, the fishes here were great, pretty fresh and generous portion. We were lucky that we only needed to wait for 20minutes before we got seated at the bar. Every order of sushi came in 2 pieces. Unlike the other omakase places that I had been, they usually came with just a piece each.Our order started with:- Seaweed with Radish foamy soup that almost didn't taste like seaweed at all, it's refreshing, it's like jelly dessert, a bit too sweet, but I liked it. (just found the name: Muzuku with Nagaimo)- Toro: this is where I said, \"if we started with this, all these fishes coming up next, better be as good\", because you can't go wrong with Toro unless it's not fresh. Theirs was pretty big portion and yet it still melted in your mouth, so delicious.- Yellowtail Belly: this fish was sliced thinly and still delicious, but couldn't beat Toro for sure.- Ama Ebi: this was alright, I'm not a fond of ama ebi and just like Shauna, when they offered to fry the heads, it actually tasted better than the sushi itself. - Albacore: this was pretty good too, I liked this a lot, the sauce was very different here. - Baby squid: to be honest, this was the dish that made me watched our sushi chef making it as it was so different, I've never seen it before. The sauce was a bit sour and it actually blend pretty well with the squid and sprinkled with a little sesame. They tasted pretty good. - Spanish Mackerel: this was Shauna's favorite, I liked the slices that they did to the fish, made it less oily and it's really fresh. - Giant clam: a bit chewy, yet I still liked it, different texture than the rest of the sushi we had eaten so far.- Unagi: I'm not usually a big fan of eel, but this unagi was delicious, the sauce wasn't as sweet as any other places, so I actually dig this sushi here.- Oyster: the only non-sushi or handroll that we got. Not really a big fan of it since the portion ws so small, I liked the oyster at Sasabune better.- Toro handroll: still good, but not as perfect as the Toro sushi we got on the first round. This was a good thing to end too, I wish I ordered Toro sushi just like Shauna to end it, then it would be perfection. The service was great up till the 3rd or 4th sushi, because after that the plates didn't get picked up as often as before and sometimes my iced green tea didn't get filled up as fast either, not that the restaurant wasn't any crowded earlier. The fact that the waiter spilled some water behind our seats and didn't say sorry was a downgrade too, but obviously I couldn't go lower than 4 stars. Our sushi chef, Masa, was so nice to us as well and listened to our every order, eventho sometimes a bit confusing, he would repeat to us the order to make sure he got it right.It's hard to satisfy me, let alone knowing that at least I'd be spending $75, the food better be great and it really was and our bill came up to $110 (tips and tax included) and since it's their 30th anniversary, each group was given a special cup to bring home as a gift. Would I come back? I certainly would, but not anytime soon, cause spending over $50 for dinner usually was too steep for me and this time I spent twice, but somehow I felt fulfilled and satisfied, so I just have to earn the money and then I'll be BACK!", "Date": "2010-03-19", "Author_Location": "Pasadena, CA"}, {"Author": "Kurt S.", "ReviewID": "MH8tsWTv0MutqoeMsI6jcQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sushi Gen is kinda like the \"office hottie\" that everyone talks about: \u00a0You hear a lot of things around the watercooler & only half of them are actually true but most of it is urban legend rooted in something someone said long ago... and kept alive by the same people that forward \"email petitions\" & \"medical warning emails\" around the office.A DOWNTOWN BUSINESS LUNCH HOTSPOTSushi Gen, as it is today, is pretty good. \u00a0It's blown up ridiculously since its inception but it's still a good restaurant. \u00a0It has the added benefit of being easy to get to from downtown & having plentiful parking. \u00a0Sushi Gen got absurdly popular after being repeatedly listed in the LA Times & the LA Weekly as being one of Los Angeles top sushi restaurants. \u00a0 It's also listed as one of SushiMasters \"Top 10 Restaurants in California\" so LA locals know about it & the rest of the America has seen it listed on Zagat LA & we all know that Zagat is where restaurants go to become generically mass market so that pretty much means that anyone passing through town that can flip through a 3 1/2x8\" book trounces through Gen's doors.BEST FOR BUSINESS LUNCHES?To its credit, Sushi Gen operates somewhat like a Tokyo kitchen - very efficiently & quickly. \u00a0Some believe their sushi to be the \"best in Los Angeles\" based on discussions I've had with folks there. \u00a0I don't think it comes EVEN CLOSE to that but it's certainly better than joints like Beverly Hill's Nishimura or La Cienega's Koi at half the price. \u00a0Sure, it's in the upper third tier of sushi restaurants for certain; \u00a0& if you need a business meeting restaurant, this is probably a good choice being that:1) It's got reasonably good sushi & authentic Japanese dishes (i.e. no bulgogi or kimchee here)2) It's got a variety of dishes that'll please the Japanese foodie as well as the \"I don't eat raw fish\" types3) They \"put the hold\" on the sushi nazi routine for noobs making it friendly for high maintenance types that usually bitch about 'not enjoying the experience' or 'rude service'4) It's on the higher end of the price scale but you won't care since you'll be able to expense the meal as businessWHAT'S GOOD?For starters, the wasabi is real fresh grated wasabi root, and miraculously they serve high quality Maeda-En tea, instead of stock Yamamotoyama. The good news is that because they churn out so much fish across EIGHT sushi chefs, they generally always serve fresh fish. \u00a0In other words, there's very little chance of you being served something that's been in the refrigerator longer than a day or two. \u00a0And when you know that the fish is going to be fresh, it's best to side with the dishes that are hard to screw up when fresh. \u00a0For example, the Ikura/Salmon Roe is quite good. \u00a0Additionally, Yellowtail, Albacore, & Salmon are all generally always good, (since most of the crowd orders a ton of it) & again, consistent in bulk. \u00a0What is served on Monday will be the way it is Friday with completely new, fresh fish. \u00a0Ask for Toyo-san - the older chef in the middle. \u00a0WHAT'S BAD?Sushi Gen is akin to a conveyor belt production line which is good for speed of service but ultimately weak for quality. \u00a0Preparation is often sloppy: \u00a0The rice is occasionally dry, the fish cut is very consistently mediocre unless you sit at the bar, knife strokes sometimes seems to be almost with the grain, I've had fish w/ a small bone in it, etc. \u00a0All you really have to do is visit during lunch to discover how often the 'ball' gets dropped.Also - something to know is that while their fish may be very fresh, it's usually of arbitrary quality. \u00a0Generally the chefs themselves go to select the fish but I really have to wonder when it comes to Gen. \u00a0And this is a point that seems to be lost on a lot of reviewers - FRESH fish does not equate to GOOD fish. \u00a0I think they serve so much sushi that they virtually become indiscriminant about the fish they select to serve. \u00a0It's probably because of all the \"business lunch\" traffic they get, who they figure can't tell the difference anyway. \u00a0(Apparently very few Yelpers seem to be able to as well, judging by the reviews. \u00a0I would not '5-Star' this place.)For example, one of their 'specialties' is Otoro & Chutoro... & most of the time it's laden with tsuji. \u00a0(fibers) \u00a0I shouldn't need to chew my sushi to this degree. \u00a0I order this for customers I bring but it's always the weakest parts of any meal here. \u00a0Also Sushi Gen serves very poor Uni. \u00a0It's usually firm, bright, & well textured... but ultimately bitter/tasteless instead of being sweet.CONCLUSION:I'll have lunch here & I'll take my customers because it's convenient & they serve a broad range of dishes. \u00a0The sushi's not bad & the atmosphere is electric. \u00a0But when I'm on my own time or I'm aiming for quality, I go elsewhere. \u00a0For those looking for alternatives, Sushi Go 55 & Komasa downtown are more meticulous about what they serve. \u00a0Or Hiko on the Westside.3 1/2-stars.

One day, we were arguing over where we will live and raise our kids if we get married. \u00a0To his credit, he made some good points. \u00a0Norcal offered more job opportunities, better schools and a less materialistic subculture. \u00a0So when it came my turn to speak, I knew I had to come up with something good. \u00a0So I pulled out my trump card. \u00a0I said - \"If we live in Norcal, we would have to FLY down whenever we want Sushi Gen.\"He was silenced.And that, girls, is how it's done.MUST ORDER:Sashimi Dinner with Tempura- For $26.00, you get a HUGE plate of fresh, fat slices of fish + tempura + miso soup + pickled vegetable sides + a piping bowl of rice- Melt-in-your-mouth tuna & yellowtail... big, thick slices that are fresh + delicious- Great spicy tuna + spicy yellowtail as well- Generous portion of hot, fresh tempura- Best deal for really good sushi in all of LASashimi Deluxe- For $35, you get an even larger plate of sashimi. \u00a0All sorts. \u00a0Including Toro. \u00a0I've never seen so much sashimi on one plate. \u00a0And such fat, juicy cuts too! \u00a0Absolutely delicious. \u00a0You really have to see this plate to believe it.- I would recommend this only to extreme Sashimi lovers who are prepared to eat.- If you love sashimi, then this is a BARGAIN.- If you like sashimi (and don't necessarily LOVE it), I would stick with the Sashimi Dinner with Tempura.- If you have leftovers, you can always pack it. \u00a0I know leftover sashimi sounds gross, but trust me, Sushi Gen fish is so fresh, you'd be mad at yourself the next day for not packing more.Uni Dinner- For $38, you get TONS of fresh uni. \u00a0And I mean tons.- Again, only order this if you can tolerate extreme levels of uni & only uni. Great deal for uni lovers though.- TIP: I personally love the combination of uni with nori. \u00a0This uni dinner is just uni over rice, with a tiny bit of nori. \u00a0I would order an extra side of nori and make my own uni balls.Amaebi:- The sweetest, plumpest amaebi I've ever had.- TIP: Make sure to ask them to cook the head in a soup. \u00a0I've never had this before anywhere else (they usually just fry the heads), but the soup is absolutely delicious. \u00a0There's an incredibly rich flavor that is just to die for. \u00a0From what I can gather, it's part miso soup, part chicken broth and a lot of shrimp brain, all mixed together with some refreshing green onion. \u00a0And there are still the 2 heads in it for you to munch on.Squid:- If you're a squid-lover like me, you know how heinous squid can be (in taste & in texture) when it's not fresh. \u00a0Not a problem here. \u00a0Sushi Gen's squid is absolutely fresh & crunchy & sweet. \u00a0It is still squid though, so if you hate squid, don't expect to like it here.Tuna:- There's no where else that has regular tuna like this.- I love the yellowtail & toro (I know, technically tuna too, but I did say \"regular tuna\") & salmon & albacore here too, but those are naturally fattier fish, so they have a higher chance of tasting good anywhere else. \u00a0But tuna is so lean, it can be virtually tasteless if it's not fresh (*ahem* frozen tuna). \u00a0And after eating the tuna at Sushi Gen, I just can't taste the tuna anywhere else.WHAT NOT TO ORDER:(note: it's not bad, it's just that I've had better in other places, and if you're going to a place like Sushi Gen, you're better off ordering what they're really good at):- Sauteed Sole- Monkfish Liver- Fried Chicken- Sea Cucumber- Lunch specials with teriyaki... I mean, it's just teriyaki. Nothing special. You can get larger portions for a better price somewhere else.This is only the 2nd restaurant I've given a 5 star rating. \u00a0It pains me to give 5 star ratings, because to me, 5 stars mean perfection. \u00a0And perfect restaurants, like perfect places to start a family, are few and far in between. \u00a0But there's no debate about Sushi Gen. \u00a0It is absolutely and without a doubt, perfection.", "Date": "2011-06-23", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Cynthia L.", "ReviewID": "35WvoFEWUTCXRO6BUkFB_Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sushi-Gen served delicious, fresh sashimi.

You are reading this because you want to know the truth about this wonderful little spot called Sushi Gen.Let's review stage by stage to be fair to the whole establishment, so that certain aspects which are good don't suffer under those that are not so good.1. Food: Los Angelians are quite obviously starved for quality food in all sectors. Why is that? Hollywood and California by its very nature places form over function, exterior over interior, so things usually look pretty and once you've been married for two weeks, the truth emerges. Well, food, business partners, Hollywood agents, fancy used cars, all have this in common in La La Land.As Californians were some of the first risk takers to attempt to eat raw fish on rice, they also still believe that they can get decent sushi in their restaurants, or that they even know what decent sushi is. They can't. They don't. Sushi Gen is one of those few spots that pulls ever so slightly above the basic absolutely rubberific quality of most sushi joints, that everyone raves about it. They also rave because like that most disgusting hot dog joint pinks, lots of people like to line up for it. Call it the Studio 54 syndrome. Followers bring followers. And so lots of people run here. Moreover, as Korean culture has seemingly displaced Japanese in town, this place functions as an anomaly as many Koreans like to eat here and yet, there are a few Japanese chefs and servers around (probably because at one point this was a Japanese run restaurant). Also, the Chinese seem to like the place too. One thing I did notice and this is always a tell tale sign - there were no Japanese people around. Hmmmmm. Oh wait, sorry, there were some Japanese looking people. But they were clearly born here the way they garbled their \"sumi-masen\" in that showy \"I speak Japanese- Valley girl\" sort of way.Well, that said, the food is good. It is nice. It is better than ok. It is not worth though the likely 100 bucks it will cost per head to eat what would amount to a 17-25 dollar meal at the best sushi restaurant in Vancouver. Vancouver - where they catch the fish and walk it over to you, kill it and serve. Yes. Really. WTF??? Oh, but let's leave that to the price area. So bottom line, I like their food. But I don't love their food. The red snapper was tiny. The salmon was good and the uni (sea urchin) was the one thing that really stood out. But not for the price. Not at all. Verdict on food - if you have never had good raw fish on rice prepared by Japanese chefs, try this place after you have first tried Matsuhisa and in Little Tokyo, the more reasonably priced and better tasting Mako Sushi and Hama Sushi.2. Sushi Chefs - They are polite, attentive, friendly, engaging and yes, actually Japanese. They seem to know their stuff. I was impressed but clearly, they have been dulled down and let down by the environment that they are in. You can clearly see the frustration on their faces when they suggest something in answer to a customer query and the response is \"um like, do you have spicy tuna rolls\". Yes. No Japanese culinary education going on here and that obviously sours the mood. Go down the street to KokeKokko and ask that question. The answer may be Sepukku. Anyway, I give them 5 stars on their chefs.3. Servers - Rude, arrogant, obnoxious Yep. Several experiences. All the same. They are not Japanese. And the attitude reminds me of my experiences living in Hong Kong. When I asked about the cost of the bill which was incomprehensible, the waitress took so much glee in trying to humiliate me by loudly running through the price of each item while I, in a low voice, kept saying that it was fine, no prob, ok, stop, please, stop. Yah. What is this about? Well, it sort of works in a chinese or korean spot where you expect the abrupt, rude, funtime experience. But in a restaurant where you just spent 500 bucks for 2 people and want to kill yourself, no, not really acceptable at all.So, 0/5 for their staff. And this is based on multiple experiences. The hosts are better. But actually, if they don't watch and manage their staff, they suck too. And believe me California people, Asians know when they are being rude. It is not part of the culture. Especially not when you are paying. You get treated this way because you encourage it. It's the Rodeo Drive, spit on me, sort of mentality. The more spit, the better it is.Price - Hahahahahahahaha! Like lol times 1000. They have to be kidding. Honestly. Like 10-15 bucks for a piece of uni. Let's all go away, catch some sea urchin and choppy choppy. The prices are bloody insane and totally out of whack with reality. I like how no amounts are listed on the sushi menu. It's all a big \"face\" scam. Read Noble House and learn about \"face\" sometime. Ok, so that's the review. It's the truth. Go elsewhere.

As I was thinking of what to order, unexpectedly I said the one word that shocked myself and Chef Masato....OMAKASE....I've been here a couple times before but it was my first time ordering omakase here and I was excited for what was in store.I told Chef Masato not to hold back on anything and here's what he dished out to me in order...- Toro Sushi- Sayori (Needle fish) Sushi with fresh grated ginger- Spanish Mackerel- Jack Mackerel- Red Snapper with yuzu- Giant Clam- Uni- Salmon Roe- Yellowtail Belly- KanpachiEverything was so fresh and delicious. My favorites were the toro, yellowtail, red snapper and kanpachi. So good in fact I ordered more of it in addition to sweet shrimp and a toro hand roll. Yup, that's the way I handle things at a sushi restaurant...I mean business! With the sweet shrimp I had the option of having the head fried or in a miso soup.

I used to buy seafood at International Marine which is where most sushi chefs buy their fish. So I know fresh sushi when I see and taste it.Sushi Gen may not have the highest quality raw fish, but the quality is consistently strong at the price point. The reason is that every Asian worker in the downtown area usually hits this place up once a week. Hence, the turnover is really high. Raw fish is expensive. Most sushi places cannot afford to stay in business if they threw away fish that didn't sell that day. This leads to a situation where most sushi restaurants serve you raw fish that is essentially a few days old. Yuck!If you know how to order, then you can easily eat well for $40 a person. I think the Tuna is always very fresh. Here is what I usually get:Tuna 2 pcsAlbacore 2 pcsHamachi (ask for the belly! It is the same price, but way better) 4 pcsAma Ebi 2 pcs Fluke fin 2 pcs. (ask for Yuzu Kosho or frsh lemon juice with salt)Salmon Belly 2 pcs.Spicy Tuna roll (they season with an unconventional chili sauce.

They told us it would be 30 minutes but we waited less than that!The place looks pretty old school/traditional. It looks cool. The tables are kind of old though. You can tell because the surface shows wear. The walls are decorated with cool art but it doesn't really blow your mind. In any case, there is great ambience if you like to see all kinds of people. It's a pretty nicely mixed crowd that you get here.The Naco and I ordered the same combo and some iced green tea. It came out to $25 each with a $10 tip. The combo we ordered includes 2 rolls with three pieces each and 9 pieces of sushi, a salad, and a \"wet\"salad composed of seaweed and some kind of Japanese yam - as well as a small bowl of miso soup! That's great value really. The chef chooses what you get in the combo which we thought was pretty cool. There are actually places where the chef not only chooses what you eat but also tells you how to eat it and it costs much, much more than you can imagine.The miso was pretty good. The \"wet salad\" was interesting - we had never had anything like it. It's very sour and is cold. It looks a bit exotic - it has dark green seaweed strands and a white substance on top which is the yam. You are supposed to mix it up and slurp it up!The iced green tea was very, very, really, really ridiculously good!Every piece of sushi was mouthwateringly fabulous!!!! I kid you not, the fish just melts in your mouth!!!! It has a soft fresh flavor to it as well. I have read reviews where people say their sushi does not taste \"fishy\" and I can honestly tell you I have never experienced anything that resembles that sensation until NOW!!!! I swear, that the Naco and I just stared at each other as we tried each delectable piece of sushi! We were dumbfounded and knew that we would never be able to try sushi anywhere else again and have this experience. It's kind of scary. Now we can truly say we are sushi snobs! Oh, and remember that this is not - I repeat not - terribly expensive sushi. WOW!!!!One very unique thing about this place is that the soy sauce is premixed with wasabi. It comes in a cute little ceramic soy sauce dispenser. The sushi itself already has just the right amount of wasabi on it.Parking is available as the place has a pretty big lot and it is validated but I read that the validation merely brings down the price. It is difficult to get free parking around here unless you are willing to walk more than a couple of blocks.

I guess those people didn't eat as much as we did as we spent $110 each (this included tax and tip).Our sushi master, Masa, started us with a seaweed soup. Or maybe it was a salad. I first started eating it with chopsticks but it was slippery we had to slurp it to finish it. It was light and slightly tart with a pretty white foam on top. Our first fish was toro. Now, when you start with toro, can it get any better than this? No, which is why I asked for more toro as my final pieces. We also had:yellowtail belly- great, not as deliciously fatty as toroamaebi- the sweet shrimp were great and we had the heads fried. I actually almost liked the heads better.albacore- I've never been a huge fan of albacore but Sushi-Gen's changed my mind. It just melted. baby squid- I think all of us squealed and went on and on about how pretty they were. I hadn't had it as sushi before and I loved this.Spanish mackerel- This is my favorite of the mackerel family and this fish was so fresh and though \"oily\" like a good mackerel is, wasn't \"old-tasting\" like some places serve it.Giant clam- Masa said it was giant clam (mirugai) which I asked was the same as geoduck. Of course it was. I actually liked it better at Sushi-Gen than when I had it in Seattle and geoduck is from the Pacific Northwest!Unagi- Not over-broiled and sauce wasn't too sweet. I wonder if they made their own eel sauce?At this point, we were slowing down. I went for a full order of kampachi (amberjack) while Virginia and I split salmon. Both were good. We also got oysters, one each. For this, I've had better oysters. Or rather, how it was topped. I didn't even try it with the provided sauce. although not the best oyster, I didn't mind having it.Virginia wanted a crab handroll which I also split with her. I thought it was okay.

Our waitress actually spilled iced green tea behind me and splashed my ankles. She looked at me but didn't apologize. Then it took them a long time to even give us little plates. I was bringing down the plate where Masa was putting the nigiri until the little plates were brought out, about 3 things in. Eventually we were given sushi with its own special sauces on separate plates. These plates weren't cleared immediately either and they started piling up. My OCD was suffering. The busser was better than our waitress though. The kitchen took a while to get us our fried shrimp heads out. And for all the money we spent, I was surprised we weren't offered at least miso soup or a dessert on the house. This is a litany of complaints which seems a bit petty but the reality was, I had a really good time with the fish. The little things wouldn't have bothered me as much if it didn't keep happening.

So when we went on an adventure for sushi (after a whole morning and afternoon of wine, truffle oil, fatty meats, breads and cheeses). figure, it's slightly healthier right? So far-- the best sushi place I've gone to is Sushi ZO (located in culver city). It had a fusion of french food in it's flavor, which I enjoyed. After this was Sakura, located on Centinela, where their huge hunks of salmon always keep me coming back. I have to be honest. When they sat us in front of Kazu-san, at the sushi bar, I was not remotely hungry. We had omakase, and I'm still dreaming about the meal. The toro was, a tour de force. Something so fatty and succulent, it enraptured my taste buds, while slowly enveloping in my mouth. It melted slowly, while the perfectly cooked rice (still warm), fell apart in my mouth. and THAT was the first order. I had seawater and freshwater eel, side by side. Never had I gone to a sushi bar, where the chef made this distinction nor, took the time to describe it. I personally like the freshwater eel better, though I would have happily, swallowed up the whole ocean to get more of those eel goodies. There was albacore with added zest and a hint of mint, which shook my senses. (I usually dislike any hint of mint like substance next to my sushi, but this worked). I apologize I don't know the exact name of the japanese herb, but hey- i'm sure Ben knows!We had Uni, unlike any other uni ever. The orange goodness was literally overflowing from the crisp seaweed (excellent seaweed!!), and I think I was actually drooling WHILE I was eating. we didn't talk much. there was just a lot of mmmmm, and oooohhhh, and whhhhhaaaaa. The fried shrimp heads were DELICIOUS! not too oily, or heavy, and it came with also shrimp heads in soup. Be careful, those little suckers will stick in your teeth all night!

I just felt like for a sushi place of this caliber their selection was not impressive and what they had was fresh but not mind blowingly delicious.

I've heard so much about this place and even my parents say it's awesome. But I have to disagree. First of all, I feel like I am at a fast food restaurant with the service. Okay I could understand it's super busy, but when we ordered, the waitress was talking super fast and when my dad asked if we could substitute some items in the \"sashimi deluxe,\" she said \"no\" and didn't give any alternatives. So we ended up just getting that and tempura since she seemed like in a big rush. She didn't even ask us for anything to drink so we were sitting there parched for awhile until she came back and apologized that she forgot. When the sashimi deluxe came, I was appalled at what were were getting. Really distasteful chopped up fish in piles. Some of them were in nice slices, but mostly random (as my dad would call it: \"cheap crap\") and non-sashimi items like a small piece of dry grilled salmon. Why the heck would you even call it \"sashimi deluxe\"?? Everything was below average in terms of taste except the fatty tuna, but of course anything that's fat, drenched in butter, or fried is good. The tempura was good but not spectacular. Also ordered 4pc spanish mackerel that came out to 12 dollars!! There were no prices on the menu, so I had no idea.. but you'd think... $4-5 for 2 pc. It was good but definitely not worth $3 a piece. It wasn't even nigiri! The other odd thing about this place is how they charge you for everything. The ginger is $1, rice $1 (ok that's normal).... i'm surprised they didn't charge us for soy sauce! At the end, the waitress quickly gave us the bill without us asking, subtly signaling that she wanted us out quickly. The second I signed the card, another lady took it away so fast I didn't even have time to blink.Would NOT come back unless I had to (like a birthday party)..

I ordered the eel avocado roll (yum!), sweet shrimp, and salmon roe.

I am not doubting their experience, but since it was a borderline 4.4 to 4.5 star range, this place definitely warrants another visit and another review in the near future.Although this place provided some very good sushi, I could not rate it high enough to make the 5-star range (4.5-5.0). The sushi alone was definitely in the 5-star range, but combine that with ambiance, and experience, it came down to a high 4-star range...4.4 stars.During my 26 minute wait...I noticed a few posted rules that some may overlook and lots have broken. They're posted at the check-in stand. One was, no cell phone use. Oh well, they didn't really enforce it. Also, all parties must be present to be seated, and finally no outside food and drink.I came alone, so my 26 minute wait period was pretty fast compared to everyone else's, but I normally eat at the sushi bar anyway. Sorry, no reservations taken at the bar, you'll just have to wait it out. That's where you will get the best sushi experience....period. But, there will be times where sitting out at the bar area may be shocking to the keen observer.Lucky for me, I got the old sushi chef. I figured, this guy has to be a master chef, that he has been around for decades just doing what he did best....the art of sushi preparation. And although his sushi preparation was superb, his handling of the sushi meat was unacceptable. He would throw back the excess sushi meat back in the cooler regardless of where it originally came from...ie throw back the excess tuna on top of the halibut sushi and obviously causing possible cross-contamination. Yah yah....I know I'm just being paranoid, but that you probably won't get contamination, but think about it....why did Dr. Egon Spengler say \"Don't cross the streams.\" \u00a0And on a side note, his Engrish wasn't the best. One of the sushi he recommended later, I just could not figure out what the heck he was saying...sounded like Giant Cramps. And I'm thinking, why would you recommend Giant Cramps too me. Didn't want to cause a scene, so I said yah yah, give me some Giant Cramps. Finally got home, and googled it, and he actually said Giant Clams. Whewww...case solved.Besides the sushi-mixing ordeal, he would throw back excess sushi and let it touch the window glass portion. Big deal again right??? Well, if you have ever stuck around until closing, you would see these guys use Windex to clean the windows...something to think about if you see them throw back the sushi and it just lingers on the glass for awhile. But again, the average person doesn't see this nor they care because it is so fast that they just overlook this or just too busy talking with your party.Anyhoo, on with the sushi. Again, sitting at the bar will allow you to see the master at his best, so you should order the best. Here is what I had on this particular Friday night. All nigiri pieces.Sopporo - 22 oz...enough said.Tuna - nice, dark red vibrant piece of meat. As good as it gets.Salmon - bright orange piece of meat, sooo fresh, sooo good.Yellow Tail - nice piece of slightly pink colored meat, very shiny too...glistens against the lighting.Chutoro - wow...amazing. I asked for Otoro, but they ran out, so they gave me the second best, Chutoro instead. One of the better Toro pieces I have eaten ever. It will literally melt in your mouth. Savor this piece slowly people. I wasn't sure how much this meat is, but I can tell you, it is somewhat expensive. But definitely a very very good piece of meat.Snapper - very well prepared, shiny creamed colored piece of meat.Spanish Mackerel - basically all the colors of the rainbow on this meat, with chopped green onions.Halibut - nicely cut, parallel along the striations of the meat with chopped green onions and soy.Kampachi - nice cut farmed yellow tail.

It's a different taste.Tamago - nice, cold sweet omelette, perfect way to end this evening.Ten different meats tonight...20 pieces total!! Suhweeet!!!!Sushi-Gen is one of the better sushi I have been in. It also makes my cut to as close as Japanese as it gets. They serve the sushi in wooden plates, and to me, this enhances the flavor. You can taste the difference, so when they place it on your plate, just let it sit there for a minute or two to get the best flavor. I have a super high standard on sushi, and this place comes as good as it gets.

The beef teriyaki was cooked to perfection which really caught me off guard, it was tender, juicy and its medium rare was just how I expected. Of course, the sashimi were fresh. The sushi were just so fresh and excellent. I really thought it was one of the best sushi I ever had. The bill came out to 60 even with tips and taxes included. Sometimes, being overhyped can be bad, I was wrong this time.

Yellowtail, snapper, tuna, belly, squid, octopus, plus tamago and eel.

It had the same cuts of fish as Chirashi, but sushi-style. He explored what fish he liked (and did not like). He also made reservations and discovered the place (double down bonus points).We also ordered the sweet shrimp (large portions, hint of natural sweetness) and monkfish liver appetizer (tasty). They serve up the fried shrimp head too, a gesture by the chef to indicate the shrimp was indeed, fresh.Make note of the 4 order minimum per person if you sit at the sushi bar.

I'd estimate that 90% of the sushi places around L.A. fit in the latter category. One rule of thumb: if they have \"philly rolls\" on the menu, don't order omakase. I'm not so snobby that I avoid places where I'll order some rolls, I just think the two types of places should be rated differently. Sushi-Gen is an Omakase spot. This has an important implication for customers (and reviewers): If you go to Sushi-Gen and order spicy tuna rolls or the typical round-eye \"sushi deluxe\", you're not making the most of the place. Not only do you miss what they have to offer, \u00a0you usually overpay for what you get. It's like going to be best wine bar in town and paying $12 for a beer instead of $15 for a great unusal wine you wouldn't have known to order yourself! With that backdrop, I think the first criteria for Omakase is that the ingredients should be absolutely stellar and fresh. No problems here: Sushi-Gen's fish is very high quality and fresh, as others have pointed out. Additionally, the rice is a bit warm - when combined with the cool, fresh fish it creates a very nice sensation on the pallatte. The second is an interesting mix of selections. If I'm giving the chef carte-blanche to choose my meal for me there should be some surprises. Indeed, there were a few dishes I'd never seen, and some I'd never heard of! One example was a spicy scallop sushi, which is to be eaten WITHOUT soy sauce. It had a lemony flavor to it with a subtle mix of spices. Finally, I we live in a showbiz town and I like some drama in my Omakase. Surprise me. Make it a conversation! My friend I had lunch with told me while we ate that he liked chopped up tuna. The chef overheard this and made a special toro roll that mixed chopped up tuna with some little fruit pieces - it was phenomenal!!! There was a flow to the meal and the sequence of dishes was as exciting as it was fufilling. Bonus points: we said we wanted to spend around $50 each, and the tab was $51 (pre-tax). So, that's why I give this place 5 stars. I think the price is reasonable for what you get when you make the most of what Sushi-Gen has to offer. It is unfortunate that people order a salmon roll, give this place 3 stars, and say it's overpriced. Fortunately that leaves more seats at the bar.

I was not impressed the first time and thought I would give it another shot so went back for a second time. Both occasions were dinner. However, still don't understand why this place is so highly rated.Food quality is average at best. It's better than most sushi places, but it is definitely NOT the best sushi place I've been to in the LA area. There are a number of great sushi restaurants in the SouthBay that offer better quality for the same price. Both times, I spent around $70 - $80 per person.And then there is the service. The waiters are okay, nothing really to complain about. Although, we did get our check even before we finished eating. It seemed like they just wanted us to finish up quickly. However, the host at the place is a total snob. Our reservation was at 7PM and one of my friends checked in with the host BEFORE 7PM was lectured about how our entire party needs to be arrived at 7PM in order to be seated. Finally when the 3 out of the 4 people arrived, still BEFORE 7, and the last person was literally 20 feet away from the front door, I checked in again and told the host the last person would be walking in in the next 8 seconds, but I still was told to let him know when my entire party arrive. Seriously, can't make this kind of stuff up. That whole process was a pain in the butt. If I want to go to a snobby place, I would head over to Beverly Hills.

The answer: Sushi Gen. That was all I needed to know. Instead of heavily researching I just showed up with my friends. I expected some fancy restaurant and was caught off guard by it's location in a rundown looking strip mall. Step inside and and it's a different world. Everything about the restaurant declares: I am authentic Japanese.The food is a sashimi purist's haven. I came on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was bustling with patrons. You can tell they have a high demand and thus turn around for fish. The restaurant focuses on the flavor and textures of fresh, unadorned fish. No fancy toppings, sauces and preparations here.One of my friends and I split the sashimi dinner and ordered a few nigiri alongside. The sashimi dinner is an excellent value ($21) and comes with a lot of fish: lots of tuna, 3pcs yellowtail, 3pcs halibut, several small pieces of octopus, squid, spicy tuna, a small piece of cooked salmon, steamed egg custard, seaweed. The octopus was not chewy at all and I was also pretty satisfied with the tender halibut. I was a little disappointed with the quality of hamachi. It's one of my favorite pieces of sashimi and it just wasn't as soft as I've had before. There was an overwhelming amount of tuna on this platter and it was all blue fin. I wish they would have replaced even a third of this with another type of fish, even if it were different types of tuna.Nigiri:Albacore tuna- luxuriously soft and melted away beautifully. Wonderful flavor. One of my favorites overall, and definitely for the evening.Spanish mackerel- very mild and soft. topped with a few thinly sliced scallions.Japanese mackerel- first time having this particular fish and it tastes more like mackerel than the Spanish mackerel. I think I like it better but it's fishier and not for sushi virgins.Yellowtail- again, very good but not quite the quality I was expecting.One of my friends got her usual Chirashi bowl that was overflowing with various cuts of fish/octopus/squid. Portions are very generous. And the rice below was really good! It had a hint of sweetness and the texture was spot on. I kept stealing some from her bowl.One of our less adventurous sushi eaters did quite well, but needed to supplement all the rawness with a cooked dish: fried chicken. It was like giant baseball sized popcorn chicken you find at Boba places. Only it doesn't come with the spicy powder seasoning, and you get four large pieces instead of a handful of smaller ones. It's dark meat and really juicy.Lastly: service. Wow, everyone here was SO gracious. The server, the busboy, the waitress... oh the poor waitress. We had so many questions about the menu. What's on the sashimi dinner? How's it different from the sashimi delux? We even dragged her over to ask what the table next to us was having because it looked that fabulous (it was the sashimi dinner). She had to come back three times because we couldn't decided what to get, but every time she came back with an easy smile and endless patience! They didn't mind us sitting and catching up for a half hour after we finished eating. And as we walked out, they thanked us kindly for stopping by.A few details: Parking is $2 with validation inside the restaurant.They don't seat you until your entire party has arrived.", "Date": "2010-04-20", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Eugene N.", "ReviewID": "Kn17UiPb6u0oOH-CUJXnfA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dang this place gets packed!

Especially when your margins are better on alcohol than on seafood. We were a more profitable table for you with a drinks heavy bill.I kindly informed her that we had exceeded their minimum per person and did not want any more food, but that we would have another round of drinks.She said she had to check to make sure that was ok.It is my experience that if a place has to put a minimum amount spent or charge more if you split something, they usually aren't worth it. If your food is good and your drinks are good, then money will be spent. This place lived up to that idea. It was not very good.Maybe this place used to be good because the reviews are great.

It is a lot of food and very filling! The salmon and yellowtail were my favorite. It is SO buttery and just melts in your mouth. Delishhhhhh!!! Other items-- crab meat, spicy tuna, cooked salmon-- were just mediocre. It comes based on the Chef's choice.- Tempura (Large: $14): Shrimp, sweet potato, zucchini, carrot. The tempura was perfect-- it is so light and crispy and crunchy. It is definitely one of the best tempura platters I've ever had.- Assortment: we also tried the uni (good, but not fab), the yellowtail belly, and the salmon skin roll.

I've literally waited across the street at starbucks for 5:30 pm to hit, so I could run to the sushi bar as soon as gen opened. I was craving sushi gen's red snapper in a very serious way. They put a tiny bit of this insane salty-bitter-umami delicious seaweed pickle on top of the snapper, and it's one of the best things I've ever tasted. That seaweed pickle takes me right back to Tokyo, and I would happily eat their red snapper sushi every day of the week. If you're planning on eating at the bar, come with an extremely empty stomach! I went once with my boyfriend when I had eaten kind of recently, and it's just a miserable experience to see all that glorious sushi and not be able to consume. The red snapper, like I said, is a must. You really can't go wrong though with any choice. The Spanish mackerel is delicious, as are the halibut and albacore. Their miso soup is also awesome, and just emphasizes how authentic this place is. It's so flavorful, and doesn't fall flat like many miso soups do. We were pretty adventurous the last time, and tried the live abalone, which they literally kill right in front of you...not at all what i was expecting. I'm not even sure I knew exactly what abalone was...but now I'll know forever. I'm glad we tried it, but I could live without having it again.

You will \u00a0waste your experience if you sit at a table instead of the bar. The sushi chefs there are awesome and authentic, whereas you have no idea who is making your rolls in the back-of-the-house.3. You have to order the Toro (Fatty Tuna). Best damn thing on the menu.4. Come Early! This place gets packed around prime time on the weekend!5. No Reservations!6. Don't forget to get your parking validated!What makes this place stand out from the other sushi places in Little Tokyo (other than the price) is that each cut of fish is perfect. You really have to appreciate fine sushi in order to savor the most of your meal here. Temperature of the food is perfect as well. The only negative side is that you're looking to pay ~$75 a person if you're ordering food and alcohol (still not the most expensive sushi place I've been to, but that's pretty pricey). I will honestly say that you get your monies worth if you're an avid sushi lover.", "Date": "2010-05-28", "Author_Location": "Irvine, CA"}, {"Author": "Luia Y.", "ReviewID": "TkEKAU5_3-R-I1ewNTgDtA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*Highlight: lunch special sashimi plate!!Their lunch special is ridiculous-- you can get a HUGE plate of assorted sashimi plus soup, rice, and tofu for $15.

One of the best sushi places I've eaten in California so far!I've actually been looking for a good sushi place, cuz I simply L-O-V-E SUSHI!! It's my favorite food out of any other out there. I am seafood's greatest enemy (: I went here today for early Christmas dinner with my fam bam. Good thing I made a reservation because as soon as I entered the door, there were a lot of people standing there waiting to be seated! I couldn't find Sushi-Gen as I was driving on E. 2nd St. But as I cornered the other side of the plaza, Sushi-Gen was hiding in the corner with a blue sign that read \"Sushi-Gen.\"We were seated inside, not at the sushi bar since it was full. The waitress was really nice and at first I wasn't really sure how the menu worked, because they didn't have any explanation to it whatsoever. So we decided to order lots of sushi because I wanted to eat sushi I love!So here's the list:-Sweet Shrimp(THE BEST RAW SUSHI EVER)-Uni AKA Sea Urchin (This was very very fresh)-Tuna -Clam-Octopus-Yellow Tail-Spicy Tuna Roll-Eel Avocado Roll (The rolls are really small, unlike the ones you get at places that have happy hours)They were all very delicious. I didn't want the fried shrimp heads since I am on a diet, but they had another choice you could get: Shrimp Head miso soup. YUM! That was delishhhhhh.I ordered diet coke. I wasn't sure and am still questioning if refill of it is free... The cup was so tiny. But that doesn't matter because one cup of diet coke was enough (: Little Tokyo has so many sushi places, but so far, Sushi-Gen is my favorite! I have to read some more Yelp! reviews and try some other good rating sushi places. Our bill came out to be over $200 with tip, but it was all worth it for a special occasion. Christmas! (; I'm gonna try some other great sushi places and see if I'll come back to Sushi-Gen or some other place. I was also trying to go to Urasawa, but their reservation was full ): So I'm guessing their sushi is REALLY good.

Included in the meal is some tofu, a picked salad, and miso soup. Tofu was quite good, but I think it would have been even better if they had used soft/silken tofu. Mmm... I also really enjoyed the miso soup. The platter is very significant. I was so full that I couldn't even finish it... and I'm a girl that can eat! (also the reason for my stretchy pants) So that is really saying a lot. I typically prefer sushi/nigiri over sashimi, but I felt it was a better deal (and I'm Asian so I can't turn down a good deal). Anyway, I wish our waitress had described the lunch sashimi to us though. From what I could tell, we had some cooked salmon, blue fin tuna, hamachi, squid, bbq pork? (it tastes like char siu!), cooked crab, a spicy tuna, another seasoned fish, maybe a red snapper? and two other things that I couldnt make out but tasted like yellowtail tuna. Haha, I probably should have asked. Anyway, all the fish was extremely fresh, and all were cut extremely well, except for my possible red snapper that was a little roughed against the fibers. For a place like Sushi-Gen, I kinda wish I got a little bit more variety in the raw fish, but at $15, that is a price that can't be beat! :) If I am ever in downtown LA again I will try their sushi platter or it at the bar. Overall, this place doesn't totally blow my mind, but it gives you good quality sushi and doesn't empty your wallet. For parking, just park in the lot -they give you 2hr validation for $2.

Although the lunch specials make it more worthwhile, I still believe the dinner is well worth it for the quality of the fish. On the negative side, the wait can be pretty long so be sure to make a reservation at least a day in advance. Also, parking can also be somewhat difficult since the plaza is pretty popular and fills up fast.

My order was basically the Sashimi Dinner but with all the rice lumped together and all the amazing fish placed on top. I highly recommend the Sashimi Dinner, though.

He's really nice, and you'll get the best cuts because the sushi sensei gets first pick on the fish. If not, don't fret. They'll never have bad fish with their rate of turnover. Can't make it early? Be prepared for some rejection. Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail Collar) and some other items may be sold out for the night. The best bang for your buck is the dinner special, but that's usually some kind of teriyaki or fried fish. Personally, I'm not a teriyaki kind of girl but if that your thing, go for it! For more adventurous eaters, I'd recommend the following:- Ankimo (Monkfish Liver): very fresh! yum yum. - Mozuku Tororo (Yam with Seaweed): Light, great texture, try this!! I don't see this dish too often. It may not be shown on the menu, but your server will know- Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail Collar): If the HK is sold out, a good substitution is the Yellowtail Head. Both sold out? sucks for you :P jk.

Then it again it was dinner and the restaurant was packed.Parking: being noobs I thought parking was the same price as it was during lunch which is $2 with validation.

Specifically, we wanted to try the sashimi platter. As we entered the restaurant on opening (5:30PM), they asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar or on a table. We chose the bar since it looked cool with authentic Japanese chefs. They have a 4 piece minimum if you sit at the bar. Retrospectively, we should've chosen the table because at the bar you can't really order the sashimi platter (I think). If you sit at the bar, you'll feel that you should order sushi a la carte since that's how it's set up--they place a nice wooden plate in front of you where they drop off the sushi. So we sat at the bar, but this is not what we should've done. We ordered about 8 pieces each (salmon, abalone, eel, sweet shrimp, etc.). I didn't like that we didn't see any prices while ordering. When we got the bill, it was ~$120. Not only was I unsatisfied without the sashimi platter, my wallet was angry for this unexpected price. We wanted to spend about $50 total just for tasting sashimi but we spent a lot more for something we didn't intend to get. Furthermore, the chef didn't speak English well so it was hard to communicate. I mean, that's cool how it was that authentic, but how can you order effectively?We paid the bill and left a little disappointed.Again, this is sort of my fault for having a poor time, but since my experience was far off the desired beaten path, I am just giving an honest amount of stars.

What test do I need to pass to get this every time and not some of the time?? It's mountain yam sliced julienne atop some seaweed mixed in a light soy/vinegar broth.

The hamachi (yellowtail) sashimi is so fresh and soft, it practically melts in your mouth. They also have yellowtail belly which is the fattier version and was just as amazing (I believe a bit more expensive). Their sake (salmon) sashimi is so sweet and tasty that nothing compares to it.

Gristly pieces were apparent from my vantage point and the assistant also decided it would be wise to cut the fish five different ways when the original manner did not work.

Cooked dishes looked fair, yellowtail collar was a nice portion that looked properly cooked, i.e. not overcooked. Sushi here is for those happy to pay half price for mediocre fish rather than spending more for a true experience and proper taste.

The sushi chefs are a lot of fun. The young one is serious and really knows his stuff. Some of the older chefs like to kid around with the diners. The friendly banter keeps the evening lively. Make no mistake, though, the chefs are all about preparing great sushi. If your sushi chef is in a good mood, he will \"gift\" you some tasty seaweed sometime during the evening. To boot, there's always this communal feeling with the people that sit next to you at the sushi bar. At Sushi Gen you don't mind when the people next to you are craning their necks to see what you're eating cuz you're doing the same thing when you see something you've never ordered before. Yes, there is such a thing as sushi envy.I like to order the mixed oshinko as the first of the a three-part appetizer menu that I have created for myself. The pickled carrots and radishes are the best I have tasted in a restaurant in the US. The oshinko is made in-house, and not taken out of a vacuum-sealed plastic wrapper.Part two of my appetizer is the mixed tempura. The batter is the right amount of sweetness, and they fry the vegetables and shrimp to golden perfection. It never tastes oily, and they give grated daikon for the tempura sauce. This is key! The Japanese pumpkin, sweet potato, and shrimp taste fresh under the fried batter.The last part of my three-part appetizer is the monkfish liver, lightly bathed in a delicate soy sauce and garnished with scallions and shaved onions. Thank you to Tim and Anton for turning me on to this delectable dish! I've always loved monkfish, but never thought I would love its liver more. Until now.You'd think I'd be done by then but I want more. I then go into the sushi: scallop, toro, albacore, red snapper, Spanish mackerel, eel... It's all fresh, simple, and melts in your mouth. Maybe the octopus or the abalone doesn't melt, but almost everything else does.I have to say I am never disappointed. This is why I return a'Gen and a'Gen and a'Gen.

They have an excellent lunch specials menu, for which people line up before the restaurant opens. They open at 11:15 am and if you are not in line by 11:10 or earlier, you will have to wait at least 40 minutes for a table. That is unless you want to sit at the sushi bar.The reason to get a table at lunch hour has been simple. The lunch specials were very reasonably priced. Although I long for the old days when the sashimi plate lunch special was less than $11 and green tea was free with it, even with the $15 or so for it today and extra for tea, it is still a decent bargain.The sashimi lunch special includes little dishes of tofu in some kind of meat broth, which is delicious (and I don't even like tofu otherwise). It also includes a small cabbage salad, miso soup and it used to include seaweed salad, but recently I haven't seen it.So even before the main dish, you get a few little \"appetizers\" that taste great. And then you get the sashimi plate itself (and a bowl of rice which I usually barely touch). The sashimi is rather a generous portion and has several kinds of fish (e.g. tuna), little octopus, salmon and teriyaki something. The contents vary slightly, but the fish is always super-fresh and portions rather generous.I did try the lunch specials with rolls and nodi maki were good, but not as glorious as the sashimi plate. So needless to say, I always got the sashimi lunch and I have been there at least 150 times in the last 9 years.The parking used to be free, but is now $1.50 with validation from the restaurant.

I finally had the chance to come here for lunch on a weekday. Apparently, it doesn't matter if you come right before their lunch hours are over because you'll still have to wait for a table. I was hoping that the lines would die down by the time I arrived (twenty minutes before closing), but I guess the ten parties ahead of and after me had the same thing in mind...There's no avoiding the lunch rush hour, so expect to wait unless you come prior to opening. \u00a0Service was speedy, as it should be for a restaurant with this much business. The workers were courteous but not particularly attentive. Understandable of course, since they need to get customers in and out as fast as possible. In any case, everything arrived promptly. Sushi Gen's lunch menu is small and revolves mainly around sushi and sashimi, the latter of which can be supplemented with unaju, uni, teriyaki, or tempura, provided you're willing to pay extra. I decided to keep it simple and ordered the sashimi lunch combo which came with an assortment of fresh fish, spicy tuna, crab meat, seaweed, some sort of tartare, and braised fish. Also included were miso soup, tofu, pickled vegetables and a bowl of steamed rice. At $15, the combo was a fantastic deal, considering the table was brimming with food, enough to send me off blissfully replete. However, despite what was stated on the menu, a lot of the plate's contents could hardly qualify as \"sashimi.\" \u00a0I wish I hadn't been so intent on getting just the sashimi lunch because, unbeknown to me at the time, they offer okonomi sashimi (your choice) as well. I definitely would have liked to make my own selections as I didn't care for some of the items that were included. Lesson learned: if money is not an issue, it's best to venture beyond the sashimi lunch combo, even if it is their most popular and reliable option. The sashimi was good, though for the most part, it wasn't the best or the freshest fish I've had, with the toro being the only exception. It was impeccably fatty, unimaginably delicate and so fresh that I was convinced the fish now on my plate had been swimming with vigor not too long ago. The spicy tuna was also excellent. The hamachi, maguro, sake, ike and tako were less remarkable, but I enjoyed them all. Albacore, my favorite fish, was missing altogether, so I was slightly disappointed about that. The braised fish, crab meat and other non-sashimi items were the least palatable. Though not unpleasant, I would have preferred a few more slices of toro instead. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that Sushi-Gen is not the best that Little Tokyo has to offer when it comes to sashimi. Still, prices are reasonable during lunch (I've heard otherwise for dinner) and the fish is undeniably high in quality. The wait can be a bit rough though it's certainly not unbearable.

One of my friends raved about this place up and down for years, but for some reason or another we never made the time it would take to make it to the door fast enough. Whenever this place was mentioned it was usually followed by a 'But we have to get there at the crack of dawn!'....for lunch....Well...the time came. We finally made it early enough. I was able to lose some sleep one morning with the mission of getting to this place early enough. But why so early? and what time is early enough?The suggestion of the locals, according to my pal, was anytime before 11am....I know 11am doesn't seem like early, right?, but when it comes to Sushi-Gen, 11am is too late. The line starts forming about 10:30. If you get in line at 11am, then expect to get lunch about 12:30, if you're lucky!What is so special about 11am in line for LUNCH, you ask? well. plenty....They have this hidden gem of a lunch that will have you camping out the next time you decide to go for sashimi here.Talk about bang for your buck! the lunch of choice for most everyone before the noon hour is the same reason you go there early. The Sashimi Lunch special. You know this one is popular when even before the door swings open, you see all the trays of sashimi waiting to take flight to each table. The serving is the most sashimi I would ever imagine for as little as $15. (see the pic). They serve you at least 5 different types of sashimi, accompanied by a tofu/miso, and a cabbage/cucumber side bite. Did I mention $$$$15. Good luck finding something comparable to this!Since my first time in this place I am prepared to set up at least 2 alarms and leave my house early enough to avoid that line (see the other pic). All for the satisfaction of diving into that sashimi medley. the Sashimi Lunch is only offered Monday - Friday. Plenty of Parking in the strip mall.

We came here for lunch on a weekday to celebrate our monthly anniversary (yay!) and enjoy something different. We found metered parking across the street and walked over ($2 for 1 hour, quarters, dollar coins and credit card only) but there is a parking lot with validation...it just doesn't have a lot of spaces and is always crowded. When I went in I was immediately reminded of Taiko in Irvine which has that same decore style and even menu. Although it had a little more on the sushi & sashimi side, something about Sushi Gen just didn't make me love it. They have decent lunch specials, prices ranging from $15 to $30+ depending on the combination of ingredients. I picked the uni and sashimi combo ($32) which came with a tray of fresh uni and a small bowl of 8 pieces of sashimi as well as rice and a bowl of miso soup. K ordered the sushi deluxe, which was a round tray of a variety of sushi. ($17, I think?) The fish was alright, it was fresh but after the initial piece, I kept thinking that it wasn't...wow. It just didn't have impact. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't...great. The flavours weren't memorable to the palate.I did like the uni, tasty and fresh, K and I omnomnomed our way through the tray, plucking at the sides like seaweed and mixed tuna salad that decorated the plate the tray arrived on. K really liked the cooked tofu side, which didn't fall apart on his chopsticks. The meal was okay for the price we paid, which was already cheaper than our meal at Toro's last week and tastier at least. But if I was given my choice, I think I'd rather pay less at Oomasa or drive to a further restaurant for a cheap omakase than drive to Jtown just for Sushi Gen. Decent but a let down in my opinion.

Yeah, we had to arrive 30 minutes before the place opened. Yeah, I would come back. But, I really would have been happier getting a 5-star experience from Sushi-Gen because that's what 1000+ reviews led me to believe. But, lesson learned. The service was rather rushed and, though understandably so, I would have preferred a personalized experience, rather than an efficient robot. I wasn't impressed with the sunomono salad. But the miso soup and tofu were surprising standouts. The tofu was infused with strong flavor, which is rather rare. The miso was clear, with a subtle hint of flavor - exactly the way it should be. The Sashimi Lunch (still $15) itself looked rather impressive. But, the flavors just don't match up to the presentation or the hype. I really only enjoyed the tuna tartare and the halibut; though, the fatty tuna was an interestingly new experience. Not sure if I would order it anywhere else though. In the end, I was underwhelmed and, after spending $33, I was craving Shoboo Kitchen's generous $30 Sashimi Coombination A.

A pretty full meal for about $20.However, you can also go with their sushi or sashimi combinations. These come with soup, sunomono, tempura, and a selection of various sashimi/sushi, of the same quality as you would get a la carte.Personally, when I want to treat myself, I'll just order off the a la carte sushi menu and just pick out exactly what I want. The sushi is as good as any that you'll get in Little Tokyo, and I think it's pretty much as high of quality as you'll get for the price.I do enjoy sitting a the sushi bar, but similar to other sushi joints, you can only order sushi there - small drawback. If you know you're just gonna get sushi, go for the sushi bar (the wait is usually shorter there too).

And lunch hours are non-existent.So the idea came to mind: Hey, we've never had omakase at Sushi-Gen! So with the plan in mind, we set off into our journey for spectacular sushi in J-town. Dealt with the usual crowd that looms outside of their doors, we waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated at the sushi bar located far into the restaurant near the restroom (I was tipped off by a third party sushi chef that it is the better seat, I cross my fingers). Let me just start off by saying that I appreciate sushi creations by quality and use of variety of modifications to deliver a punch that would resound with a CHO-OISHIIiiii (Very tasty). That may sound like more of a fusion taste, but whatever it is, I was expecting to see some exotic mixtures of fish and unfamiliar tastes.With that said, we were greeted with an appetizing bowl of muzuku with nagaimo, had no idea what it was but it was a welcome change. It was quite slimy but I didn't mind, though I can tell there would be some that would not be able to appreciate it. Then came the barrage of sushi that I'm more familiar with--kanpachi, tuna, uni, aji, hirame, giant clam, etc. All VERY fresh and good, but it was lacking in one department... and that is taste. Not to mention the cuts were a little shy compared to what I am used to, but that is besides the point.The snapper topped with the green sauce (wish I knew what it was, lol) was delicious and is totally what I'm looking for in sushi. Sushi that deserves to be eaten without the aid of wasabi and soy sauce. Sushi that makes you see colors the first time it pairs with your tongue and shifts colors in the mating duration. Honorable mention would have to go to the monkfish liver sushi, first time having it and despite the fact I don't like liver anything, it was surprisingly good! Good job! Got a serving of anago and in my previous experience, anago has always been on the dryer/bland side so I was a bit scared. To my surprise, I liked it! Not bad :)Otherwise, I craved a little more flavor. I craved a little more sauce on each bit (or any sauce for that matter).

Sushi-Gen came up as a familiar name and they had good reviews. It was obvious it was a good place when we walked over, the place was packed on a Wednesday night. We had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated.We started off with a few drinks, Sake & Soju. I'd never had Soju before and was tempted to order it and try it. I was very suprised at what it was, I was always under the impression that it was sweet, and more of a mixed drink. In my mind, I'd always thought it was a Korean Sangria or something lol. Boy was I wrong. It was pure alcohol on the rocks. Granted I drank it :P It grew on me. Reminded me of a vodka tonic with the wedge of lemon that was inside of it. We ordered a few things for dinner, Miso Soup of course :) I had the regular Tofu one, my friend had the Mushroom one (she said that one was a bit slimy with the mushroom). I was happy with my Miso, it was average.We ordered the Fried Eggplant and it was incredible. I'm a huge fan of eggplant and the flavors with the sauce where so delectable. We had an eel avocado roll & a spicy tuna roll, they were both very good. The fish was very fresh and the size of each cut roll where perfect. Bite size, not falling apart. Lastly but not least, we shared the Black Cod which was seared, unlike any fish I have ever tasted. It remind me of scallops.

There are also no prices at the bar so make sure your wallet is stacked or else you'll be in for a big surprise!You have to try their live sweet shrimp with the option of frying the shrimp head or having it in miso soup. I went for the miso soup and OMG! So gooood!! The kumamoto oysters were by far the freshest, most delicious oysters I've ever had. They are also famous for the toro, which literally melts in your mouth. Other recommendations are the red snapper, albacore, and spicy tuna.

It's authentic and fresh. All the thanks goes to my wonderful Fourth Year Japanese teacher, who told me about this place.I hate the large crowd and long wait (to get a table and to get your food), but it's worth the trip, JUST for the quality and deliciousness of the fish here.The salmon sashimi is my favorite-- it's not on the menu, but they offer it on the paper you write your order on. It *used to be* $15 for 6 or 7 generous pieces of fresh, succulent salmon, but now it's $21. I swear by the salmon belly at Sushi Ota (in Pacific Beach), but this salmon (even if it's not the belly part, I assume) is also orgasm-worthy. Eating this sashimi makes the world stop and time go slow. I wish I could come here once a week.My only gripe is that none of the entries on the menu serve raw salmon sashimi (or sushi, I believe) at all. Even the regular and the deluxe sashimi entries DO NOT have any raw salmon! The deluxe has a portion of salted cooked salmon, which isn't nearly as good. Thus, my only question is, WHYYY??! It's the yummiest fish they have there, and it doesn't get featured! Oh, the agony.I usually order the sashimi deluxe and the salmon sashimi, and it's more than enough food for two. The tuna sashimi is also excellent.The first time I visited, I ordered the sashimi + tempura combo plate. My tempura came out relatively fast, and my sashimi took forever to get. Once I got the sashimi, I was shocked at the quantity of food (even for the combo dinner entry), and could not finish it. :( As we all know, leftover raw fish is not recommended for eating.Cons: again, the long wait. The parking lot isn't too great or big, and you have to pay to park there. Also, the place is pretty tiny, and I've heard it used to be even smaller, back in the day. Also, the servers are running around like crazy in between all the tiny spaces separating the seating areas, trying to get everyone's orders.

It was already late-ish and we wanted to eat. So, Yelp suggested this spot.We opted for a table (after waiting for about 20 minutes, which didn't bother me since it was a Saturday) since we weren't all that hungry and apparently the sushi bar has a 4 order minimum per person. In my opinion, that's too much food for one person but whatever.We split 4 \u00a0sashimi (yellowtail, albacore, tuna and salmon) and 1 spicy tuna roll (and a side of white rice) and were beyond full. I was semi freaking out because the couple at the table next to us had a bill for $350 (!!!!!) but our total (with a large beer) only came out to $40. Just to spell it out for you, we ordered 5 pieces for the both of us....thats slightly more than half the bar minimum, so at the bar we would have been paying about 70-80 for too much food.Not to say this place isn't good, it definitely is!

Customers have to remember that the whole point of a sushi bar is so that there is an interaction between the chef and the diner. Like a guest, the customer is treated to an enjoyable evening while the chef prepares the fish as he sees fit.Compared with my experience in Japan however, sushi-gen is still not the best. Some of the fish were lacking in flavor, and the order of the fish is problematic at times. The tamago was boring and stiff, and the yellowtail belly was slice thin. However, hats off to the unagi and the amaebi, which were quite good. The amaebi was firm and vibrant in flavor - sweet but not overwhelming, tender but chewable. I think the amaebi that I had a la carte was only $6, and it came with two soups with the heads. Amazing deal.

A friend of ours told us that this place has a great cost-performance, so we decided to check it out. Looking at the previous yelp-comments, I knew about the average 30-50 minute wait. However, they skipped us and seated a few pairs of people that came after us. Totally understandable because we were a group of four, and there wasn't enough seats for us. But if that happens too much... There's a problem there.All of us ordered a Jyou-Sushi set (About $16) which comes with 8 or 9 pieces of sushi. The neta (fish on the sushi) was fresh and tasty, but the cuts were a little too small. They made the portion of the shari (rice) smaller to adjust to that small neta. Thinking that Edo-mae (Legit Tokyo style sushi) is supposed to be like that, it may not be a problem, but after finishing the meal, I thought I could eat another set. I recommend the teens who eat a lot to get some sides with it too.We asked for some oshibori's (wet-towels) to wipe our hands before eating the sushi, but they said they were 50cents each. Hot-Teas are a $1.50. Extra Gari (Ginger) $1.A little too stingy and miserly. What sushi restaurant charges the customers for extra gari?It was certainly not bad, but was it worthy of all that hype? I really think that Sushi Gen serves solid Sushi, but there are many other places around LA that deserve just as long lines, considering quality vs. price.

Seriously, though, say hi to your Mother for me. The octopus, squid and spicy tuna are even good and I am 100% fine with compromising those for higher quality salmon, tuna, and yellow tail. Get this special - it really encapsulates what sushi should be, which is a journey across wonderful flavors, temperatures, and textures.

It was then followed by a selection of tuna, kampachi, uni, aji, hirame, giant clam, amaebi, monk fish liver, anago, etc. I'm used to having more creative and adventurous sushi. Thus far, I prefer Toros in Alhambra. The cuts are not as generous as Toros nor was it as tasteful. At Toros, you know you'll never have the need to use any soy sauce and the wasabi is the real deal.

Food: So yes, the fish is quite fresh. $200 to feed four people fresh? I'm not yet sold. We ordered a seemingly endless array of sashimi, nigiri sushi, and a few rolls (yelp.com/biz_photos/YBmk\u2026). I say seemingly endless because it certainly wasn't. I was starving at the end of this dinner because we were trying to keep the cost down. My favorites were the ikura (salmon eggs), pickled gourd rolls, sweet shrimp, and the red snapper. If you've never had pickled gourd before, you really haven't lived. It's tangy, crispy, and best of all neon yellow. The sweet shrimp is severed and served in two pieces. First the head is deep fried, feelers and all. Next, the body is served raw as nigiri sushi (on rice). I loved the head. The body was a thumbs up as well, but probably less so. I wasn't blown away by the texture or taste of anything on this plate unlike my experience at Sushi Go 55. Perhaps because of the long wait I just ate way too fast. Service: Expect an hour wait or more for dinner and equally crazy hours for lunch. According to friends who are loyal customers, it's possible for your wait to exceed the operating hours of the restaurant. Have a backup plan ready and definitely do not go here when you are starving. You might die. Atmosphere: Pretty low key inside.

So good, I could eat it all day.Lightly Grilled Salmon : Slightly cool and good, although I would have preferred it be sashimi.Octopus (Tako) [sp] : Best I've had to date, but didn't make me a fan.Squid (Ika) [sp] : Interesting texture, not my favorite. Clam [sp] : Never really liked Clam sashimi, but it was okay.Unknown [sp] : White stick of something that flakes, didn't taste great, not nice texture. What was it? I don't know.Krab (Kani) : Its imitation crab... whats to say.Not-spicy Salmon [sp] : Tasted like the scallions more than salmon, hence I wasn't 100% sure it was salmon.Spicy Tuna : Pretty good, very scallion-y but at least you could tell it was Tuna.3 types of tuna:Yellow Tail (Buri/Hamachi) : Very delicious, up there with the bestAkami : Chopped into smaller pieces than usual, and not the best I've ever had, but good regardless.Toro of some grade : I'm not sure what cut of toro this was, probably Chutoro (medium fat), but it was absolutely delicious on the first bite, and every bite after that I had to question whether or not I had just put a sliver of fish flavored butter in my mouth. It literally melted on my tongue. Very delicious, but very fatty which is why I'm wondering if it was even possibly close to regular Toro (fatty), or Otoro (very fatty). If it was just Chutoro I fear what true Otoro tastest like in ones mouth.I failed to ask exactly what everything was, and it would be great if someone could and then post a review on the exact contents.Anyhow.

It is NOT because they have special fish that by natural selection was strong enough to swim from Alaska to California's muscle beach, even if they do share the same coast! so, SLAP & flips table.I'm not actually that angry because it's been a few months since I've been here.

The restaurant was full when I came here, but we only had to wait for around 10 minutes for a table. We got seated fine and began looking at the menu. We immediately saw that there weren't a lot of things my bf loved, so it took us a while to decide what we wanted. Also, we saw that their california roll plate was $18, so we had to ask. The waitress had come by every 2 minutes to rush us to order, and when we asked about the california roll plate, she simply said \"this restaurant is real japanese sushi. No fancy rolls. This is 16 piece of california roll.\" \u00a0She also gestured to take our menus away so we could leave. We didn't appreciate that at all! I also understand they are busy, but we weren't there for 30 minutes trying to decide. It was 10 minutes max. I felt very stressed. We ended up ordering a \"tuna tatare\" appetizer, a sashimi platter and some simple rolls. One of them was the spicy tuna. The tuna tatare ended up just being the spicy tuna mix on top of some cucumber, and seaweed. So we ended up having too much spicy tuna in our meal. The waitress, knowing this did not advise us towards something else, or let us know this was the case. I used to be a waitress for 5 years, and this was definitely something I would've pointed out to my guests so they can experience a broad variety of what the restaurant has to offer. \"Meh.

It didn't have the nice cold feeling you get when you eat sushi/sashimi. The sushi didn't have the nice bite, where you're biting into something, rather the sushi was short, and thin. I took a bite, and I went straight to my tooth, there was no give. The pieces were small and the place was completely overpriced. What everyone calls fresh and \"authentic\" just shows me that Los Angeles does not have great sushi. I've eaten at a lot of places, and while I may not yelp them all, I've eaten and experienced a lot. Hong Kong had amazing sushi and for half the price. San Francisco's Tekka is 100 times better. The sushi is three times the size and much more reasonably priced. A yellowtail (hamachi) is three times the size, and is only $4.50 for ONE PIECE. The uni is definitely fresher, and instead of giving you one piece, Tekka gives you THREE PIECES, and it's only for $5! The toro is definitely toro at Tekka and it doesn't have fibrous fish tendon hanging. The scallop is HUGE and has a bite at Tekka. Sushi Gen has NOTHING on Tekka. It's completely overrated. Travel around and have sushi and let me know. Compare the quality of the fish, the size and the price.

The service outside of the counter area was slow and unenjoyable. Our waitress didn't really know too much about fish... though that might have been a language barrier issue.- The taste of the sushi was... fine. We found that the pieces of sashimi on the sushi weren't actually cold.- The portions were ginormously tiny and thin compared to other places. The sushi was ridiculously expensive for what we received. A vegetarian in our group ordered a vegetable roll, which cost more than $15 - what we received were 6 unbelievably small pieces of a cut roll, MUCH less than an inch in diameter. We spent almost $200 for 4 people and left hungrier than when we went in. We actually went to have a satisfying second dinner at Hama Sushi down the street.Tip: if you have a vegetarian in your party, go to Hama Sushi down the street; their miso soup and vegetable roll (and I believe tofu) are of good portions, flavorful, and really well priced.Now, I did take a look at what other tables were ordering--sashimi platters--and they did look good.

My friend and I got here around 45 minutes before the place opened (11:15 AM on weekdays; 15 minutes more of waiting than I expected!) We were fortunately seated right away, so we did not have to wait long for our food to come. We decided to get the Sashimi lunch special, just because I've heard great things about this place. I think I've ACTUALLY been here before, when I was about 8, but I don't remember it. I can't believe I don't, because I will never forget it. For $15, you get so much fresh fish, it's ridiculous! You get a platter of sashimi, miso soup, small salad, and a bowl of tofu with a light broth. Thank goodness for the small dishes, because those came fast, and I was starving! I thought the small salad and miso soup were just so-so; nothing particularly special. However, the tofu was really delicious. It was a firm tofu similar to agedashi tofu, but not fried. It was dipped in some sort of beef broth it seemed, which paired so perfectly with the tofu. I liked it since it was firm too, since it didn't fall apart when you tried to grab it.Next came the almighty sashimi platter! Tuna, yellowtail, toro, squid, this sort of dried fish, cooked salmon, diced yellowtail with green onions, crab, and spicy tuna...all for $15, what? And this wasn't just any kind of sashimi--it was a kind that literally melted in your mouth once you bit into it. The fish was so fresh and soft that you did not have to put any effort at all into eating it. It was fantastic. There was a generous portion of each. The tuna, yellowtail, and toro came in the traditional style sashimi--sliced fish of about 4 pieces. Each piece was so delicious, I did not want them to end. I think my favorite was the toro; it was almost as if you were eating butter (the consistency, at least) but tasted SO MUCH BETTER. My words don't do it justice, but definitely save this piece for last :D There was a piece of squid, which was also fresh. Very chewy texture, which paired well with the pieces of seaweed they gave. The dried fish that came with it was also delicious--a bit salty, but so good when paired with the rice. The cooked salmon (although I usually like fish of any sort) was nothing compared to the sashimi! It was still pretty good though, just not the best on the plate. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The diced yellowtail with green onions, crab, and spicy tuna all came in a spoonful placed onto the plate. It was kind of like mini dons, if you know what I mean. Take a spoonful of rice and pair it with these, and you've got a good meal. I liked these, but once again, the sashimi was the star of the show. The sashimi here was probably one of the best I've had, and hence, the 5 stars. Also really good service and very efficient!

Don't be, that's how Sushi-Gen does. Actually, that's how top sushi restaurants do back in their home country. Want good stuffs? Prepare your guts and wallet, and come to Sushi-Gen.I've been to JP for many times and always love to try any sushi retaurant that has a line outside their door. Sushi Gen has the same atmosphere and smell, like Tokyo and Tsukiji central market. I went there with my best friend on Thanksgiving weekend. We arrived at 12:10 pm and there was already a long line for it. We sighed up on waiting list (host was very friendly) and waited for 45 mins. And then, it was the sushi feast.I don't really care about \"no price on sushi menu\". To be honest, living in Austin, Texas is a disaster for Sushi lover like me. When I'm in LA or SF, I'd love to pay pretty money for EXCELLENT sushi. Here I was. We sat at bar and greeted by a young sushi chef who worked next to the oldest chef. I'm sure he needs to watch his back all the time hence quality is undoubtedly good. First round, we had ika, taco, ikura, and hamachi. Ika and taco were prepared and preserved carefully. I could taste the fresh and subtle seafood protein sweetness without anything extra to ruin it.They were also very easy to chew and swallow (not like those crappy and gummy ones). And then comes hamachi. The color and texture of this baby was gorgeous, so was it tasted in my mouth. Other than that, our sushi chef did a great job of making nigiri. Fish and rice melted in my mouth as they touched my tongue, with perfect portion of FRESH wasabi, YUM. You ask me about ikura? All I could remember is they pop in my mouth and I know only top quality ikura can bring you that. Since ikura is one of my favorite, 5 points extra for ya, Sushi Gen. Unagi, tamago, sardin, saba and benito are also very very good. If you like vinegary \u00a0flavor, definitely try saba and sardin. The reight- to-point sourness from rice vinegar dresses with grated ginger would bring you to heaven directly.The most important stuff that afternoon, of course, was amaebi. Listed on VIP price line, I was quite hesitated if I should get them. After 3 seconds struggling, my appetite told me \"you fool, try it while you can\". So I did. It. was. de-li-cious. I repeat, DELICIOUS. Amaebi means sweet shirmp and once they touched my tongue, it was literally melted. The smoothness and sweetness were even better than hamachi. For those like shirmp head, Sushi Gen would deep-fried them for you. As for the taste, do you really need me to explain?We order about 12 sets of nigiri, almost tried everything they had that day.

Normally, ordering a platter at a sushi restaurant (as opposed to a la carte) implies that you are lazy, have no imagination, and not enough taste to specify exactly what kind of fish you want. As punishment you'd get the dregs of the kitchen - the unwanted, filler pieces - the egg, the plasticky octopus, way too much tuna. But the combos at Sushi Gen are legendary for being abundant, fresh, full of interesting pieces (I'm embarrassed to list what you get because some of it I don't even recognize!). And you get a LOT of it. And it's way cheap for what you get. $15 for 20 pieces of quality sashimi on the lunch menu (it's listed simply as \"Sashimi\"), including rice, miso soup and tofu is jaw dropping. At dinner, the $26 Sushi Deluxe meal is mindboggling. I mean, it comes with a million things including uni.

But I will say that, as of now, I can barely remember any place that has better sushi! ( I have been to Hokkaido and stuff too, unfortunately probably not to all the right places). So, I'll proceed with my list of favorites and possibly some tips?Upon reading lots of reviews here, it seems like most people take advantage of the sashimi deluxe and eat at tables and stuff. People, you don't get to appreciate the true awesomeness of Sushi-Gen by sitting at the tables! I mean, the deluxe is great for price + quality and all, but people can't expect to be blown away by that. I truly believe that the best way to have the Sushi-Gen experience is by sitting at the bar!Now, my favorite chef of all is Chef Masa, but that could be because he seems to know exactly what type of sushi I'm into, and he's much more adventurous with me. Another good option is Kazu, who also seems to be a veteran. The sushi bar is no doubt much pricer (possibly double the price of the sashimi deluxe and stuff), however the quality of the food is just completely better. Boyfriend and I used to sit at the tables, until one day we braved the bar. Needless to say, there was no going back. Shelling out that extra 80 dollar difference to sit at the bar was worth it for us.Personally, their staples of awesomeness are definitely the Toro and Uni. But, because I tend to like things that other people don't order as often, I'm going to have to vouch for their lemon-salted halibut fin (seared) and the Ankimo with ponzu. Also, try coming during the \u00a0opening hours, or at least before 7pm. Unless you want to wait 30-45 minutes, don't come between the hours of 7-8:30pm. No kidding. After 8:30 pm works too, but you do run the risk of them running out (gasp!) of the best sushi (They've run out of hamachi belly and uni and toro on me once....I was sad).

\u00a0The sashimi dinner with a side of tempura ($26). \u00a0I think 95% of the time I have dined at the table, I get that. \u00a0 All the dinner plates start with miso soup, tsunemono, and pickled vegetables (usually a cucumber and cabbage concoction). \u00a0Lets start with the miso soup. \u00a0I feel like you can judge a good sushi restaurant by the attention to detail in the miso soup, having the correct ratio of dashi to miso paste, as well as having the tofu be unbroken. \u00a0Sushi gen hits all three of these aspects wonderfully; this is how I know this is the precursor to a wonderful meal. \u00a0The tsunemono is deliciously sweet and tart at the same time, serving to counterbalance the saltiness of the pickled vegetables and miso soup. \u00a0The salty pickled vegetables are the weakest part of the trio, but it's refreshing when eaten in conjunction with the other two items.After that comes the main course: a plate full of sashimi, a bowl of perfectly cooked hot sushi rice, and a side of shrimp and vegetable tempura. \u00a0The tempura itself is delicious; not too heavy, crispy, crunchy, and piping hot. \u00a0It's the perfect side to a cold plate of heavenly sashimi. \u00a0The usual suspects in an order of the sashimi dinner? \u00a03 slices of tuna (sometimes fattier, sometimes leaner), 3 slices of hamachi, their house special spicy tuna (I guarantee you its like no other spicy tuna you've ever had), chunks of yellowtail, chunks of regular tuna, tamago, either tako or ikura (octopus or squid), some sweet preserved fish (this is indistinguishable to me), and a cooked piece of salmon (kind of the odd man out), all served with a generous helping of seaweed. \u00a0The specifics are up to the sushi chefs, but it usually comes out like that in some fashion. \u00a0All of the fish is of the highest quality, although I wish they served salmon sashimi instead of the cooked salmon (they don't make substitutions). \u00a0A comparable plate would cost 3-4 times as much at any other establishment west of downtown (sasabune and hide sushi come to mind, but I'll be honest, those restaurants pale in comparison), and the portions are so generous it borders on the obscene. \u00a0For my money, the sashimi dinner combo is the best meal in town, and I will challenge you to a duel if you dare dispute this.I've also had the pleasure of trying their various appetizers, from the ankimo to their fried chicken, and the quality of the food is definitely there. \u00a0But honestly, if you are going to go to a sushi restaurant in the heart of Little Tokyo, you should be eating the raw goods and eschew the cooked.I've only eaten the omakase once before, but I must say, it was absolutely delightful. \u00a0While I am sure there are better authorities than I to the world of omakase, the flavour pairings and the order of the fish prepared by the chef were simply superb. \u00a0From what I recall, we started with the prototypical orders of fish, including toro, hamachi, and mackerel. \u00a0It pains me to say it, but the quality of the fish served with the omakase is just out of this world, just a cut above what is offered to the main restaurant. \u00a0Pun intended. \u00a0We proceeded with other more adventurous fare: albacore with thinly sliced green onions, mirugai with a touch of yuzu pepper for added kick, and scallops so sweet it threatens to overwhelm. \u00a0A nice touch is that the chef intersperses the orders in a way where some of the nigiri you eat with soy sauce, and some you don't; he will tell you beforehand what the proper way of eating the order is. \u00a0The amaebi is also exceptionally sweet, with the fried head serving as a textural counterpoint to the sweet shrimp. \u00a0The only downside to the omakase? \u00a0It can easily run you 50+ per person before sake, which ups the joint a dollar sign. \u00a0It's a bit more decadent than the table meal, but either way, you can't go wrong with Sushi Gen.", "Date": "2011-06-04", "Author_Location": "Santa Monica, CA"}, {"Author": "beauty m.", "ReviewID": "srzNVddjCE7Fkb6AVtOqlQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since sushi is one of my passions, I like to start my life as a critique by adding to already numerous FANTASTIC reviews for Sushi Gen. \u00a0Yes, there's long wait; yes, there's no parking; yes, they don't take lunch reservation; yes, it's hard to stand around or sit outside while you wait for the table. \u00a0However, as a loyal customer for the past 6 years, I have to say that the consistency and freshness of quality of food is unbeatable. \u00a0I like the basics. \u00a0Sushi combo or Sashimi combo. \u00a0For a faster service, you can call-in to ask to put your name down on the waiting list.", "Date": "2009-12-12", "Author_Location": "Beverly Hills, CA"}, {"Author": "Ruth C.", "ReviewID": "EyXWTRPvnhJrfIoXeMX5dw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place is always bustling, but the service is attentive nonetheless.

Getting past my initial confusion, I ordered the salmon collar lunch special which comes with a nice portion of sashimi, miso soup, rice, and a small amuse bouche for the table. My friend ordered the veggie roll, and we also had a tempura appetizer. Wow! I loved everything. The tempura was crispy soft and delicious! We had shrimp, zucchini, eggplant and potato, all perfectly done. The miso soup was just right, and just what I needed. I found the sashimi very fresh and melt-in-my-mouth delicious - their fish is perfectly cut into thick slices and feels nice and cool on the tongue. The salmon collar was amazing - a huge serving, perfectly flaky and moist. It was served with squid, crab, and sweetly fried anchovies - the mix of which was excellent with the bowl of rice. I wish I lived in LA and could get this lunch special everyday! I thought the prices were high, especially for the veggie roll and the tempura, but the lunch specials are priced well for what you get.

As a result, we literally went all out on the ordering, with sashimi deluxe, toro sashimi, uni sashimi, and an individual order of beef teriyaki with sashimi each, which was slightly overkill. I've never had to actually hold myself back from consuming rice while eating sashimi, because it definitely doesn't come cheap, but this was one of those rare moments in my life until I become a sparkling entrepreneur (as opposed to a budding one).Uni I believe speaks for itself. Always been one of my favorite sashimi dishes, and always will be. Toro on the other hand, was a whole different experience. This may have been my first time trying it, but damn it does not look like your typical fish. It actually resembles more like quality raw kobe beef, glistening with fat, unlike the typically transparent form of tuna. If tuna was chicken of the sea, then toro was definitely the prime quality bacon of the sea. I could've cried with my first bite, soaking in the buttery taste while I bit into it ever so slowly, letting the fish dissolve itself in my mouth. drool.Yellowtail hamachi (also one of my favorites) was very delicious as well, in the best quality you can probably get this side of the pacific.I think I've consumed enough fish for a month.

We arrived just before noon, and there was already plenty of people waiting outside...so if you are working on a tight schedule, it's probably best to get there a little early or to call ahead and make a reservation. Since we were here on vacation, we could absorb the 35 minutes of waiting around in the parking lot area until we finally got a seat. It's not a tiny place (at least by the Manhattan standards I usually measure against), but it's definitely packed at lunchtime. Service isn't anything remarkable, but they do get you your food quick, and the waiters definitely give the aura of wanting you to be quick with ordering, quick with eating, and quick with paying as well.That said - I was shocked by the amount of sushi you get for your money out here. When I saw the sushi deluxe and the sashimi were each $15, I questioned whether or not this was going to be a large meal - with $15, you might be lucky to get 3 pieces of sushi at some of the high-end sushi spots in NY. Boy, was I wrong...they give you a TON of sushi and sashimi at these prices. And we got the cooked eel over rice with sashimi...so we ended up with a lot of freakin' fish on the table. And to be truthful - the quality was pretty good overall. They don't do exotic types of fish like they do at higher-end stops, but they give you lots of tuna - both the fatty kind, as well as the regular bluefin - as well as yellowtail. The sashimi comes with some tartare-style tuna as well, which was delicious. One highlight was the squid, which definitely was a lot less chewy and tough than I've had at other places. The toro here is pretty well-done - very buttery, very rich flavor, and they present it in many ways (tartare, sushi, sashimi).I wouldn't say that the sushi here is the best I've had, but for the quality and the quantity you get, Sushi-Gen is pretty much a sushi joint that you have to stop by. I do wish the variety of fish was greater, but they are very good at what they do here, and the price is unbeatable.

We came on the Saturday night with three adults and two kids. Luckily we had reservations, otherwise I think our wait would've been well over an hour. At 6:30, the place was crowded already and people were spilling out the restaurant door. Make sure you show up on time if you have a reservation. When I called, they told me they would not hold the table and that the entire party had to be present. The restaurant has a private lot (entrance on 2nd) which made it easy to find parking. The information on yelp says that it's not good for kids, but they do serve food other than sashimi, so it's all good. We ordered yellowtail belly, salmon, salmon skin salad, beef teriyaki dinner, california roll, spicy tuna roll, and sashimi dinner. The dinners come with miso soup, pickled seaweed, tempera, and rice. I must say that I really enjoyed the soup and the seaweed salad. The tempura was also very good. The rolls were delish and the sashimi were awesome - definately felt like heaven in my mouth. The sashimi dinner came with various sashimi including tuna, spicy tuna, some white fish, squid, cooked salmon, sardines...sorry don't remember/know the rest, but it was good. You never know what you're going to get with the sashimi dinner though, so what I list wouldn't even matter. But I believe the waitress said sashimi dinner will always come with white fish and tuna - the rest is up to the chef. For drinks, we ordered green tea. My sister and I had it hot, and my husband had it iced. Though the tea is the same, the hot was actually $1 more than the cold at $3 a pop. But the green tea brought me back to Japan - tasted like what I remembered it to be at the tea plantation in Japan. Loved it. Thank you Sushi-Gen.

Because we were at the bar, we didn't order entrees, \u00a0which would be rude to do anyway. I think the host said it's a 4 order minimum per person and no menu items.

Toro - MELTED IN MY MOUTH! 5 star toro. Toro should always be this way. Hamachi - good 4 starKanpachi - good 4 starikura - good , standard and freshsalmon - 3.5 stars it was kind of standard fresh, not exceptional. That's all I can remember that I ate. All the fish was fresh.Green Tea - was fresh ground tea leaves strained, very oishi. But I had to wait and ask for more tea. Service - typical quick Japanese style. Its the way I like it. Feed me and serve me and leave me alone. Sushi Chef was friendly enough, very talented (I always observe the cutting techniques.) He was quick with making the rice balls, while paying attention to the customers he was serving.  This place would have gotten 4 stars if it had better rice. Sushi really can be hit or miss. First of all, it should always be fresh. Rice should always be tender. And the chef should be trained Japanese style (These guys were.) I was once told by a sushi chef I used to know, that he didn't eat sushi. He only ate it while apprenticing to understand the freshness while training with observation. But when he came to the States, he only wanted Hambagas...tasted better to him. My point (in a confusing way) is that excellent sushi is all relative. It depends on what you've had before and what you like. It also depends on what the fish buyer can get. The freshest Squid or Eel will never taste good to me because I simply do not like it. I've had lots of Toro, and this one is the best, but next time I go, it probably won't have the same tasting Toro, because I ate the last of that one. \u00a0The toro they find might not be as great a quality like tonight's.

Yes the fish was fresh, but for the money the quantity and the choice of fish you get was not up to standards as our favorite place (Komasa's) down the street. First of all the size of the sashimi was quite small as what we are use too, and the choice of sashimi, well that is not an option. You order a sashimi plate and you get what ever the chefs choice is for the night . So if you have your heart set on the kinds of fresh sashimi you want or like, then don't come here . If you like someone else to pick your full sashimi dinner then this place is for you. Just beware that most of your dinner will be cooked salmon, rubbery octopus, cooked crab amongst other rubbery crunchy slimy fish and other side things that you don't know what it is as well. Oh and ginger... Well if you like ginger, just know that this is another extra charge. Service i must add was very poor, \u00a0the server was too over whelmed and very hard to understand as well.

Friends of mine took me here last Wed night. It was just the 3 of us and we feasted!! We ordered the sashimi deluxe which was absolutely fantastic. I think the assortment really depends on the day you go. Hit or miss. I don't really like ordering chefs choice of assorted anything.. but my friends advised that it is really well worth it. The assortment of the sashimi deluxe was awesome. We got some toro, tuna, yellowtail, ika and salmon. Not to mention the tuna tartare(both in regular and spicy) We also got the sushi deluxe- that was sad and I was not impressed and it was smaller than the sashimi delux. I had asked the waitress if they had grilled chicken gizzard, and they said yes- they came back with pieces of fried chicken- don't ask. Wanted to return that but the friend had already dived in to it. We also got miso soups which were pretty good- not the heavy and powdery stuff. Also ordered shrimp and vegi tempura which was alright. Including the 2 bottles of sake we ordered I think the bill came out to be $175. Since I had a good experience here and it was the only sushi joint I knew of, I took my cousin here last Sat. It was just the 2 of us and we got there around 9pm. It was packed, but we didn't have to wait. We ordered the sashimi deluxe - and I was soo disappointed. I never stuffed myself with so much tuna! That's all there was and like 3 pieces of salmon!!! Fresh, yes- assortment BAD!! We also ordered the grilled smelt fish which was sad. I've had much better in NYC. We also got an order of uni - thank goodness I was happy with uni.. ohh.. yummy uni..

This is my 5th review of low cost lunch offerings in Little Tokyo and we came specifically for the sashimi lunch special. We started off with small plates of pickles, sunomono (Japanese salad that enhances the appetite), delicate tofu cubes with a lovely hint of beef broth and miso soup. The sashimi special comes in ceramic platters holding pillars of fish and others made into salads. The generous portions of tuna, halibut and yellowtail were ultra-fresh with perfect texture and taste. Equally as good were small portions of squid and crab. There was no salmon except for a cooked portion which I found to be tasty (surprising given the fact that I normally feel that cooking salmon is a waste of good fish). The chopped and spicy tuna salads were good but visually unappealing. In the end, at just $15 their sashimi special is exceptional both in terms of the quality and variety of fish and price.

I have to have a raw fish fix at least once a week (typically 2-3 times a week). Sushi Gen is hands down, no questions about it, 100% THE BEST that I have had since the beginning of my quest to find the best sashimi. As prior reviews have mentioned the Lunch Specials are awesome because of the price. They have the same items (same quality/quantity) on the Dinner menu but at almost two times the price. My two favorite items on this menu is the Sashimi Special ($15) and the Chirashi Bowl ($15). The Sashimi Special is a generous assortment of tuna plus cooked salmon, some cured fish, a little bit of octopus and a couple of other things. Typically if I'm in the mood for a bigger variety of fish (salmon, unagi, tamago etc) then I get the Chirashi Bowl. Either ways the fish is so fresh that it begins to melt a little bit as soon as your chopsticks touch it. Then, you put it in your mouth and it disappears without any real chewing involved leaving you with the wonderful essence of the fish. The portion size is very generous and I typically have a difficult time finishing the entire meal. The meal also comes with a cucumber salad that is not sweet or sour (as I would typically expect from Japanese cucumber salad), a wonderful warm tofu that had been cooked in a meat broth, miso soup and rice. My boyfriend is not as crazy about sashimi as I am so he typically orders the cooked items on the menu. All the items that I have tried off of his plate has also been very tasty - Salmon Teriyaki, Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Lunch Specials (so far) have all been delightful. They come with rice, salad and a yummy creamy Japanese style potato salad. I have not tried the Sushi Bar portion of the restaurant yet because they do not allow you to order from the regular menu . There is also a minimum order. Also, one last awesome thing about this place - they do TO-GO orders at lunch. If you cannot make it to the restaurant by 10:50am-ish to wait in line for their 11:15am lunch opening I would recommend ordering to-go or going a little later otherwise you will have to wait around until the first wave of people finish eating (30-45 mins).", "Date": "2011-02-27", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "D E.", "ReviewID": "cehCxUktxYFpQnJqRqUkzw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love sushi. \u00a0This is by far the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to. \u00a0Everything is always incredibly fresh.I also love the yellowtail collar (and the dipping sauce it comes with). \u00a0It's amazing how much meat you can dig out of that sucker.The chicken terriyaki is surprisingly good, too. \u00a0I don't usually like chicken skin, but they make theirs crispy and tasty.", "Date": "2011-05-03", "Author_Location": "Mountain View, CA"}, {"Author": "Julie C.", "ReviewID": "_4a1mzneS6im72vRiUz_mg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "$15 Sashimi Lunch Special! \u00a0Nuff said.", "Date": "2011-06-21", "Author_Location": "Redondo Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Jacky L.", "ReviewID": "pw94OuUT7LVw5GIGGESERA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the best sushi places I've been. It is neatly tucked at a small plaza in Little Tokyo in downtown LA. I was there for a night and thought I'd check the highest rated sushi joint in LA. Not disappointed.I tried to make a reservation, but on a Tuesday night they were too busy to take reservations at 7pm. So I went over there and for a seat of one, I waited about 20 minutes. Well worth it consider the food that I had.A very packed restaurant, but the waiters were attentive for such a busy hour. I ordered mockfish liver for appetizer, and for nigiri I had otoro, ama ebi, uni, salmon, and unagi. The mockfish liver was, perhaps only to my personal taste, not very delectable. The smell was a bit too strong for me, but that might just be me.I tried toro for the first time, and to my surprise it was not as amazing as I had heard/hoped. Perhaps all the hype and talk had gotten my expectations to skyrocket too much. The ama ebi, however, was simply amazing. The ama ebi, which is also called sweet shrimp, was very fresh and chewy, not to mention flavorful. It was so good that I just had to order twice. The restaurant also made the shrimp heads into fried delicacies, which were incredibly succulent with a drizzle of lemon juice. The uni was also one of the best that I've tasted, with the sweetness still lingering in your mouth long after you had savored the sushi. Unagi was great, melt in your mouth status, but the salmon was alright for me, above average but not on par with the ama ebi and uni.Aside from the sushi, I also had the deluxe sashimi platter, which was a huge plate full of fresh sashimi for only $35. Well worth it in my opinion. My bill comes up to be $71 for the nigiri plates, $6 for the mockfish appetizer, and $35 for the deluxe sushi platter.I had an amazing experience at the place, and I would definitely visit it again for the uni, sashimi, and most importantly, the ama ebi.", "Date": "2011-07-12", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Endra M.", "ReviewID": "w_OcVIyafE9u4GgC1LYrOw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the dishes.

A lot of people complain about the sashimi lunch consisting of mostly tuna. I personally prefer it that way just b/c I love tuna. And the amazing part of it all is that the tuna here literally melts in your mouth. The uni dinner is also very worth it!! I'm not sure if this is the lunch or the dinner price, but it's only about $38 for so much uni. Honestly, this place is as good as it gets! One thing I do have to complain about is the service. I sometimes want to deviate from the norm and order other things. But the lady makes it impossible. She's ALWAYS coming to ask us what we want. I get it. People come here for the lunch special (that's why if you get seated first, it comes out wihtin a minute or so because they were already preparing for it) but if I tell you I need a couple more minutes.

First of all, this place isn't a secret. I think Yelp has caused this place to explode with business. We arrived 45 min after they opened and the wait was an hour long for a table for two. I really wanted to take a star off for that, but I just couldn't because they did so many other things right. We ordered the sashimi combo with salmon teriyaki and the sushi deluxe with a salmon skin salad. The piece of salmon for the salmon teriyaki was huge compared to other places i had been to. On top of that, it was grilled to perfection and the sauce tasted great. The sashimi and sushi were thick cut and fresh. Best part was, as the waitress was placing the sushi combo in front of me, my eyes had darted to what looked like a toro sighting. As I bit into it, my mouth had agreed with my eyes. Worse part was, I had to share half of that with my girlfriend. Moving on, service was decent. Everyone was polite and attentive even though they were probably the busiest restaurant in Little Tokyo on any given weekday afternoons. The parking lot was a decent size for that type of plaza the restaurant is in. That being said, given the amount of business they have, parking was an issue. They will let people in regardless of how full the lot was. They DO validate parking. Two bucks gets you three hours of parking.

There's nothing fancy about this place and you have to go through a lot to get a seat. Service is always bad and you are rushed from the moment you sit down. I have had a forgetful experience here before but that was because I ordered other things besides their sashimi. The bottom line is that Gen has amazing sashimi and nothing more. The good news is that it is light years beyond most sushi joints. Gen doesn't serve pseudo-rolls that are fancy with predictable taste. Instead, it gets down to the core of cutting premium fish. At Gen, you will eat the best sashimi you could imagine and imagine this: the sushi actually does \"melt in your mouth\". You leave the place wondering where the heck they get their fish shipments from and why other sushi places in LA don't do it the way they do. It just shows you that Sushi is a food that requires skill and knowledge beyond cutting and rolling. Gen will merit a spot in any sushi-lover's top 5 list.

I usually go eat out on weekend nights and i had to wait outside for an hour and 30 minutes.2. Price isn't even that cheap. You are looking at overpriced toro,uni, amaebi for the quality of it.3. Service is slow. It's understandable in a way because there were a lot of people in the place but they should hire more sushi-man or something for faster service. I think i waited around 15 mins for a plate of sushi.4. Fish quality and portion sucks. I was expecting bigger, fresher sushi for the price but it was small and cheap quality.As a sushi connoisseur who has had sushi at many different restaurants, I found that the quality of the fish (not high ends but ones like salmon tuna yellow tail) was decent.

My usual favorites include hamachi belly, uni, as well their monk fish liver appetizer which is fantastic when it is served slightly warm. \u00a0The amaebi (sweet shrimp) which you can request to have head used to make miso is also a consistent winner, although not coming close to the traditional japanese amaebi you find in Hokkaido which is much smaller in size, very seasonal, and usually not available. \u00a0They do also sometimes carry both chu-toro (medium fatty) as well as o-toro (extra fatty) depending on what you're looking for. \u00a0I generally don't bother with the white tunas or the albacores, so I can't speak to it. \u00a0But I love aji (spanish mackeral) except that like many sushi places, they tend to drown it with too much ponzu. \u00a0Fortunately, this is an easy fix simply by asking the chef to take it easy on the sauce. \u00a0I have yet to be disappointed by the seafood they serve here, with the exception of my last visit, where Kanpachi simply wasn't up to Gen's normal standards, but, at the same time, it the was the first time I'd been served by that particular chef (the one at the end) and maybe his knife had just been used to cut another more pungent fish. \u00a0Worth removing a star? \u00a0I think not (yet). \u00a0Bottom line, good reliable fish for those who like raw fish, with the occasional specials thrown into the mix, albeit overall not tons of variety per se. \u00a0And yes, they can be pricey depending on what you order, but, as others have said, there are other options as well.All in all, I think a few things need to be acknowledged, based on the reviews I've seen. \u00a0First of all, being busy is a good sign that inventory is being turned over, which is especially important when it comes to fish, so all of those complaining about the wait should either show up earlier or get over it. \u00a0Any busy good restaurant requires some sort of wait. \u00a0Second, the comment made about \"anyone can do fresh fish\" if you have the money is a little irresponsible. \u00a0Not everyone can do fresh fish, as demonstrated by the host of sushi restaurants out there, including many who can clearly afford it, who do not serve great fish. \u00a0Those of you who have been to a major fish market like the Tokyo Fish market and understand the lengths the Japanese go to in order to secure the best ingredients will attest to the fact that selecting, buying, and having access to great fish is a challenge in itself. \u00a0Great sushi preparers treat the process of selecting, handling, cleaning, preparing, triming, and serving their fish much like the way fine steakhouses and serious shabu shabu places do in how they prepare, trim, and age their own meats. \u00a0Its certainly not as simple as buy, slice and serve as some would have you believe. \u00a0So appreciate the unique attention on handling the fish for what its worth.", "Date": "2008-01-30", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Mich S.", "ReviewID": "V6mR7AQmZcvxL3NEKBavQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Definitely one of our favorite sushi restaurants. \u00a0It is on the expensive side, but you definitely get what you pay for. \u00a0Toyoshima-san (the owner) has the freshest fish available and his sushi chefs are terrific (especially Kazu!). \u00a0This is not somewhere you go to eat fancy rolls or even cooked sushi (though the unagi is good - as is the hamachi-kama) - you want to eat sushi and/or sashimi here.", "Date": "2013-04-12", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "M K.", "ReviewID": "XSTJF2Lx2pSgdXM5fanWxA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The sushi and food here is extremely fresh, carefully crafted and therefore tasty and memorable. \u00a0It's not cheap or expensive-- kind of an inbetween price (we spent about $50 for two people just for food) but if you love sushi or raw fish or japanese food at all, this place is delicious, reliable, and consistent. \u00a0Atmosphere is cute-- fairly traditional japanese decor and really nice wait staff and sushi chefs.", "Date": "2006-05-27", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Karina H.", "ReviewID": "B8xEfxEtCICFbDwiO8LkOQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i get the sashimi deluxe and beef teriyaki when i come here. \u00a0fish is fresh. \u00a0i hate waiting though and the last few times i came here for valentines day \u00a0or for my moms bday..had to wait about an hour :(", "Date": "2013-12-06", "Author_Location": "Monterey Park, CA"}, {"Author": "david e.", "ReviewID": "5WbbM2HSAaHBzliqRnBurA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "note to self: \u00a0sashimi lunch special for $15. \u00a0get kampachi.", "Date": "2008-09-03", "Author_Location": "Walnut, CA"}, {"Author": "jenny h.", "ReviewID": "H8xkH_XTRKAgwyK3w2htUg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "sushi gen is a machine. \u00a0they pump out quality sashimi platters at top speed. \u00a0we got a table on a friday night (after waiting for 40 minutes) after hearing all the hype. \u00a0i think i would give this place 3.5 stars for now, if i could. \u00a0everything was good, but not spectacular. \u00a0i think because this place felt like such a machine compared to Sushi Go 55, where everything is small, and there is such attention to detail. \u00a0maybe this is sort of the downtown equivalent to Hide on the westside. \u00a0both are generally good, but something about them gives me this mass production feel. \u00a0we got the sashimi deluxe platter, which had tons of fish but maybe not the best. \u00a0for example, i dont like how the tuna was chopped up. \u00a0also the spicy tuna - not so crazy about that. and the cooked salmon?

I went in after 1pm and got seated very fast at the sushi bar.( usually when you sit at the sushi bar during busy hours you have to order sushi/sashimi only, no lunch specials) I sat my kazu san, who is the best sushi chef at Sushi Gen. The sashimi lunch special was very good, and it was a lot of food and definitely very good price for $15. It's a must try, and you either get there super early or should just show up after 1:30p after the busy lunch crowd. The 2nd time I went there, I so happened to be sitting at my old spot by Kazu San and the family sat right beside me has been going there for around 20 years and the dad goes there regularly like twice a month ever since sushi gen opened in the 80's. So I over heard him talking about his sushi and he knows Kazu san, him and his family had ordered Omakase, which is basically to leave it to the chef to select what's good, and kazu san served them toro, uni, spanish mackerel etc... SO I had ordered toro, uni already and after I started talking to the family, I decided to get the Omakase too. I ended up eating a little much, and Paid over $70 for my lunch. I work a lot and I eat out almost everyday, since I'm such a foodie I pay for good food without a blink. It was an experience. I'm not going to say Sushi Gen has the best sushi in LA, but you get what you paid for.

they never have that dull, mealy texture that is so prevalent elsewhere. \u00a0Each piece is savored separately, and there is time between servings so you can cleanse your palate with ginger, tea, beer or sake. \u00a0Embrace it for the experience it is, and expect to spend at least an hour and a half here.The sush itself is great. \u00a0The warm sushi rice is made with the perfect amount of rice vinegar and sugar, and the sushi is very very fresh. \u00a0My grandpa used to say that Toyo-san's rice was fantastic and not like \"inaka\" (farmer) rice which tends to be harder in texture and lack the delicate vinegar flavoring. \u00a0There is also a very good fish-to-rice ratio. \u00a0I crave the toro here. \u00a0My mom's favorite is the aji (\"the fishier the better!\" as she says), and my dad goes crazy for the uni - smooth like buttah. \u00a0We also really appreciate nice touches that other sushi bars don't bother with - shiso leaf on top of the salmon sushi and FRESH amaebi with fried heads, for example. \u00a0The sauces are also not too overpowering for the fish. \u00a0This place does things right. \u00a0No green tea bag - the ocha is brewed. \u00a0Homemade miso soup - not out of a box. \u00a0Oshibori towels upon sitting down at the bar. \u00a0It's kind of sad that I used to take these touches for granted.I also really like the smallish, intimate atmosphere at Sushi Gen. \u00a0It seems strange to be in a tiny, forgotten J-Town strip mall. \u00a0But once you're inside, you feel a thrill like you've discovered something special. \u00a0I have watched Sushi Gen's popularity grow over the years and - although I feel like my hidden treasure is not so hidden anymore - I am pleased to see that it has graduated from a popular Downtown lunch spot to an in-demand dinner loaction. \u00a0It's no-frills, but very cozy - and you also stand a significant chance of spotting a celebrity. \u00a0This is a fantastic place to impress a first date with your knowledge of \"cool authentic holes-in-the-wall\". \u00a0Just be prepared to wait a bit - last time I went, they still weren't taking reservations. \u00a0The atmosphere at the sushi bar is broadly collegial - everyone feels privileged to be there. \u00a0I took my fiance there and in one trip, he changed from thinking \"sushi is ok, but I don't see what the big deal is\" to feeling like he'd never even had sushi until his experience at Sushi Gen.Finish up your experience with some mochi ice cream, invented by the local Hashimoto family at J-Town's Mikawaya bakery!", "Date": "2007-04-22", "Author_Location": "Menlo Park, CA"}, {"Author": "Veritas Lux Mea N.", "ReviewID": "o9u57tzdTxalTGUDASPWcA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "...i love sushi........the quality of the fish here is great....as traditional as it gets...the chef gives you what he feels like giving you...so if you dont LOVE sushi or know what 'good sushi' is.......don't bother coming here bc there is no 'ambiance'...i'd come back to ensure i wont get mercury poisoning :D", "Date": "2009-01-26", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "don c.", "ReviewID": "6gATYdorsOz5au_Fke3kHQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i like sushi gen. yes they did change owners a few years back and yes it is owned by a korean now. but does any of that matter? the food is still very good especially the lunch sashimi deal. although they give you a lot of tuna and not so much other stuff. you can only make tuna so many ways. thus the four stars. other than that come early and expect a wait at lunch unless you go at about 10:45 and wait to be first in line which actually saves you time.", "Date": "2012-08-03", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Elafoodie W.", "ReviewID": "cnTPsnep4U4xeapMbZwpJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have been goiong to Sushi Gen for over 20 years. i still consider it to be the best sushi restaurant in SoCal.

It was completely packed with a half an hr wait when I arrived. As soon as I saw all the Japanese business men here somehow I felt it picked a pretty authentic spot. We opted to sit at the sushi bar and we thought the best way to go was omakase. Every piece of fish was extremely fresh. We started out with regular tuna and toro, yellowtail and yellowtail belly ( my fav), freshwater eel and giant clam, red snapper, albacore, uni ( sooooo sweet), scallops from Japan, and some tuna cut rolls with cucumber rolls with shiso leaves. I usually am not a fan of these plain rolls but I thought they were fantastic. There were a couple other pieces that I think I forgot. Along with that we had 2 bottles of sake. The bill came out to be $115 which I thought was a complete bargain. I typically pay around 80-$125 for omakase. The only negative thing I would say about the place is probably that their selection of fish is not as exotic as say Sushi Zo. But the price for sushi at Sushi Zo is is pretty much doubled.

It seems like this place might be one of those sushi nazi places because there were a bunch of signs at the front including one for no cell phones and no substitutions. Sharing is also apparently frowned upon because there is a $10 minimum for each person so if you share, you will still pay at least $10.

One big negative was the additional charge of $1 for ponzu sauce!?!? Who ever heard of such a thing?!

You order the ankimo (fish liver) and you are only presented with two pieces or mediocre stuff - it's not even silky smooth as it should be. The Salmon Skin salad was horrible. On top of a skimpy salad are pieces of rubbery and soft pieces of what should be \"crispy salmon skin\". For dinner, it came out to about $50 per person without ordering toro. For lunch, it came out to be $80 per person when order toro and all the good stuff. So you can make your own judgement call.

We went to this one on a recommendation of a friend, who raved about this place, but does not have a lot of experience with a lot with sushi.First, we had one issue with service. We went with a friend to this place to celebrate her birthday. Since my wife is pregnant we usually bring a bottle of water for her just to be on the safe side. I always order drink for myself anyhow and no restaurants (including all of the other sushi restaurants) have had any issues about it until Sushi Gen. When we were seated the waitress promptly said no outside drinks. We explained the situation, but she was very, very insistent. We agreed to buy water from her since she said that they sell bottled water. She brings the menu which has the water selection that they sell. We ask for one of those that has a familiar name (Evian), but she said they didn't have any. We asked for another one, Perrier (I think) and again they didn't have any. The only ones they actually had were a unidentifiable bottle of water from some small unknown country and sparkling water. \u00a0Still they were not understanding about my pregnant wife's request.We go ahead and order the sushi dinners and a teriyaki dinner for my pregnant wife (who unfortunately cannot eat sushi for the time being). I would say that they were pretty ordinary among decent sushi restaurants. Nothing special about the quality nor the selection. It was okay. The quality, cut, and lack of anything special about the sushi definitely did not warrant the price. I've paid more for sushi many times, but it was way better and I've had this level of sushi, often for less money.So the issue would be that they don't offer value for the price that they charge.

Had the Sashimi Deluxe (double the portion of sashimi lunch + 5 pieces of extremely chewy low grade toro), uni sushi, ankimo appetizer, albacore sashimi and two rolls (spicy tuna and california). Considering the price of the sashimi deluxe ($30), the portion was generous but I didn't find the fish of that great of a quality (as most reviewers mentioned). The fish has a lack of taste (since it was served straight from the freezer) and there is no bite to it. The uni sushi tasted just like the supermarket packaged uni but with a 1000% markup. Ankimo appetizer was served warm and thank goodness tasted decent. Albacore sashimi was a total rip-off ($21 for 6 tiny slices of supermarket quality frozen fish). Don't order it!! The rolls were okay. If you happen to pop by Little Tokyo and wanted a cheap sashimi lunch, this is the place for you (and I strongly believe the $15 sashimi lunch is why this place got such high ratings).

The big question is, was it worth the wait?What we ordered: As appetizer, monk fish liver ($6) and salt grilled hamachi (yellowtail) head ($15). Two of us shared a sashimi deluxe ($35), two bottles of large Sapporo ($7 each), no rice ($3), no miso ($3 for a very small bowl), no sake. The waitress was pleasant and efficient. With 20% tip, the bill was $90. Not exorbitant for a nice Japanese dinner for two, but neither would it qualify as cheap eat.What we got: the monk fish liver was rich and flavorful. But then, there is no chef magic in this dish. The liver pretty much comes from the distributor as is, the chef just cuts off a piece and serves it with ponzu, chopped scallion and tobiko. No points added. The hamachi head: I am used to having more rock salt rubbed on and a little more burnt. They probably choose to use less salt to let the real taste of the fish come through. No points deducted. Lastly, the sashimi deluxe for two came with most of the varieties served in very small pieces (thumbnail size), which means the restaurant was likely using side cuts and corners that are close to the tendons, i.e, not prime cut. Also, piling small pieces together makes the portion look bigger. Not a nice trick. Points off.On the positive side, the dish had good variety. Two slices of octopus were the basic thaw-and-serve, no surprise there. The three very tiny slices of squid was fine, enough to tickle the palate. A sizable lump of spicy tuna was tasty, but still, like the squid and the octopus, it's cheap stuff. A pile of salmon skin shaving had already lost its crunch, and had to rely on its oiliness and burnt flavor to carry the day. There was one lone cooked shrimp, a slice of tamago (Japanese sweet egg), a small pile of tiny red snapper pieces, and two piles of tiny tuna pieces. Next, there were four small slices of flounder/sea bass/amadai, and two normal size slices of salmon. So far, everything was good, though nothing spectacular. But wait, right in the center of the dish was four good size slices of hamachi, firm and fresh. Impressive. And... whoa, what's that behind the hamachi? Five slices, I say again, five good size slices of toro (tuna belly). You hear it right, we got toro, and lots of it. The slices were classic melt-in-your-mouth tender with great oily taste. For the toro and the hamachi alone, lots of points added.Four or five star, you think? Not so fast. Restaurants are about not just the food, but also the ambiance, the convenience and the service. The service was ok. Sushi-Gen is small, always very crowded, crammed and has very little d\u00e9cor or atmosphere. The wait was unbearably long, yet they did not have any waiting area inside (there were four chairs next to the door and that's it). They would not take your phone number to call you when you are up, so you must stay and wait for over an hour, or come back periodically to check in. The two guys at the host stand were surly. Many people stood inside to wait, and one by one they were told to get out of the way. We came back from outside after the 45 minutes wait, and had to stay inside because they were about to lock up the door. The whole lot of us were physically leaning against the back of the chairs of some sushi bar diners. Worst of all, they are draconian toward diners. At the host stand there are notices, one after another, that said: no smoking (fine, that's good); no laptop use (ditto), no cell phone (I don't like people talking on the phone while dining, but disallowing it? That's going too far); if you sit at the sushi bar you must order everything a-al-carte, with four orders minimum per person; all diners must be present or you won't get seated (we witnessed two parties turned away for that reason); and written in two different notices: we reserve the right to refuse service to anybody (please sir, I want some more sushi); the list goes on. Remember Harry Potter Order of the Pheonix, when evil Professor Umbridge made one new rule after another, and you see Filch nailing the new orders all over the wall? Now you get the idea. Bottom line: Do you like eating really late? We got there at 8:20PM; we started eating at almost 10PM and that was not by choice (they locked the door at 9:30). This place is all about the food and the food only. If you want good sashimi and don't care about time or comfort, this may be your place. But for the same money or perhaps a little more, there are lots of good choices around town, where you won't have to wait for over an hour, endure the attitudes of surly staff, sit over the shoulder of other diners, and beg them to do you a favor and take your money. You are the customer. Don't torture yourself. Four stars for the quality and value of the food. One star for everything else.
