I will definitely be returning, and would recommend it to anyone who loves quality meats, delicious sweets, and a good ol' BYOB. So what if we waited 15-20 minutes to be seated? The weather was lovely and I was in great company. Besides, I never mind waiting a little longer for good eats. Speaking of which...- We started with the seafood salad (Mezcla del Mar), which was delicious! Fresh and savory, with a tangy little pop of fresh squeezed lemon that created the perfect flavor balance. Simple and satisfying. I could stand to have more of this salad in my life. - I got the filet mignon entree (El Filet) and have zero regrets. It actually comes with two fillets as well as a little cup of chimichurri sauce (I could've used two of those) and a healthy serving of spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. I wasn't a huge fan of the mash, but that's more because I'm simply not big on potatoes unless they are either in fry form or sweet/yam form. Not your fault, Tango Sur. That's an ongoing personal issue I'm working through.- My date got the Bife Ve Suvio, which he destroyed. It was an amazing feat to witness, since they really load each dish up with copious amounts of meat. He just got really quiet and Hoovered that thing. I was able to salvage a sample and it was HEAVENLY! - Holy mother of flan! Now when I tell you that I'm the kind of gal who \"likes\" flan, I mean that I don't particularly \"love\" flan. Like, I never go out of my way to get my hands on the stuff and am usually pretty \"meh\" about it when I do. But that thick, rich (but not too rich!) dollop of dulce de leche on top makes Tango Sur's flan the only dessert I ever want to finish a meal with ever again. Real talk. I don't ever need to see another piece of chocolate anything if I can have this stuff instead. My date is even less of a fan of flan, but was fully converted as well. Seriously: try the flan, thank me later.And to top it all off, our waiter was a dream: super friendly, helpful, attentive and hospitable. He was tipped very well in return :)All in all, this was easily one of THE BEST meals I've had since I moved to Chicago almost two years ago. And that's coming from a gal who's really been eating her way around the city.

We sat outdoors this time and that was the best part of the meal, nice patio seating and a bottle of Champagne on a Monday night.Anyone who puts this is the \"best steakhouse in Chicago\" in their review really needs to clarify exactly WHICH other steakhouses they're comparing it to. They probably haven't been to any of the big boys Chicago is known for. Even at a lower price point, it's just not worth it.The meat was, meh, not at all the awesome steak of my memories. I got the El Filet. Cooked right, just bland and really dependent on the sauce. The spinach mashed potatoes were just awful, no potato flavor and watery as other reviewers have said. Yes, no potato flavor sounds odd, but it was a flavorless green paste. The rolls are just sad: tough, cold, chewy in a bad way.Their service is VERY \"laid back,\" if you want something, like your check, you need to be assertive. Not a negative per say, just be aware and adjust your expectations accordingly.Follow the four star hype if you want, but Yelpers got this one wrong.

I'll start with the positives, the ambiance is great for a date night, candlelit, very intimate. The empanadas were ordered for our appetizer were pretty good, they were cooked nicely and had a good crunch and flavorful filling. Unfortunately the positives stop there. We were seated ridiculously close to another couple (I was much closer to the man at the other table than I was my husband. It took the intimate vibe to an awkward level). The bread we were served looked like day old rolls from Thanksgiving at Grandma's and tasted like it too. We waited over 30 minutes between our appetizer and entrees. When the steaks did arrive the plates were swimming in juice from the meat. I ordered mine medium well and classifying what I got as rare would be generous. I requested that it be cooked more and when I got it back it was still under cooked, but I didn't feel like asking again. The meat was next to flavorless and the potatoes were runny.

I mean, waiting sucks, but drinking while waiting makes things a-ok. On to the food ... man are the portions generous! Let's start off with the empanadas. They really are what everyone claims them to be : amazing, delicious, tasty, mouthwatering, appetizing.. you name it. I ordered 2 empanadas for $2 each and they were really filling! My group had fun sharing our empanadas with each other. Also, where else can you get an appetizer for $2?! So the steak ... again, believe what everyone tells you when they say the portions are huge. Thanks Tango Sur for not only cooking up a delicious steak, but for also being pretty generous with the portion. I ordered the Churrasco and it was like 3 servings worth of meat for me. I had plenty of leftovers for the next day! The prices for the steak do seem a bit on the pricier side (my entree was around $23-24), but think of it as 2 meals in one and it justifies the price. (Not to mention the quality of the meat! I believe our server said the meat they use is grass-fed). I would have given this place five stars except for : -the dim lighting : It's nice and intimate, but is kinda straining on your eyes -our server was kinda touchy: every time he spoke to us he would touch someone's shoulder or arm.

We started off with some empanadas, which were good (but there are better ones elsewhere). Both of us got steak (which is what they're known for), and they came out cooked perfectly. The spinach mashed potatoes were great. The portions were massive, we both had leftovers. The prices were really reasonable for a steakhouse and for how intimate the place was. Service was attentive and friendly.

At roughly 9:45pm (about 15 minutes later than the latest time I was quoted) I got a call saying,\"please come back your table is nearly ready\".. we walk back the 200 ft to Tango Sur to claim our table and the guy says \" please step to the left sir\".. we got behind one couple who within minutes was moved right in, then 10 minutes go by and its 10pm, my wife asks the man, \"how much longer do you think it will be?\" He replies with some suave and predetermined answer,\" Terribly sorry for the wait but we have guests who have paid their bill, we are just waiting for them to leave their table and we will get you right in.\".. just then a guy behind us walks up speaking in Spanish and suddenly after a few chuckles he and his date are swept right in. I had enough, I began telling the guy off, more than a few choice words were surely included, the manager comes out apologizes and takes us right in and offers to comp our appetizer.. it is now roughly 10:05ish.. we sit down and our waiter comes by.. he brings water and walks straight away.. 5 more minutes go by(I'm watching every minute at this point I have to grab my car by 11pm) he finally comes back and we say\" Yes we are ready to oreder. Can you bring the appetizer out with the food, we've waited a very long time and have to pick up our car in less than an hour\".. the waiter looks dead at me and says, \" ah the kitchen is backed up it will be at least an hour til your food will come out.\" I said\" but the valet closes at 11pm do they come in at least to give you your keys or basically am I losing my car potentially at 11?\" He nonchalantly shrugs at me and says \" hey were busy food will be an hour at least I dont know about valets\" I stood up middle fingers in air and walked out..

We were sitting outside on an early fall night that required the heat lamps to ultimately come on. The water guy was obsessive about constantly filling out our glasses with ice water even though I'd ordered a cup of hot water with lemon. The \"salad\" was a joke. It looked more like the toppings for a burger. Two big pieces of lettuce (that was really bitter!) and two slices of mushy grocery store tomato and a big slice of raw onion. What kind of date joint serves raw onion at the top of a meal. The \"olive\" oil in they served on the side of the \"salad\" looked like that over processed half olive/half canola crap that comes in big jugs and the red wine vinegar didn't really add much to the already pathetic salad. We ordered the \"Para Dos\" grill thing for the two of us. I've had better blood sausage. The chorizo was good, well formed but not actually spicy. The sweetbreads were alright. I haven't had a lot to compare to, but I ate a few. The flank steak was alright, but between the flank (flapmeat, as they call it on the menu) and the short ribs, I wouldn't confused \"range fed\" with \"grass fed.\" This meat is most certainly grain finished. It's heavily marbled, gristly and fatty.We ordered a side of sweet potatoes. Looks like they cook-em just like I do at home, but I'd say they were slightly under-done. Throwing a sweet potato in an oven and peeling the skin off is pretty damn easy. I can do it. Preparing it in an interesting way would have made it worth the $5. It was not worth $5. I grilled mine on the little grill to give it some added flavor.The waiter was over attentive at the beginning of the meal, offering us wine glasses after we said we weren't drinking and didn't bring wine.

Thick and textured and really green. The spinach and garlic add a lot to this traditional side dish.- Ham and cheese empanadas with chimicurri sauce; I preferred this pairing to the spinach and cheese. It was like a fancy homemade version of a hot pocket. No arguments when there's flaky crispy dough involved.- Filet mignon - as I mentioned above the dish comes with 2 large cuts of filet. There's a tasty red wine sauce that's drizzled a top the steak that just enhances the melt-in-your-mouth tastiness.- Order the provoleta. It's melty cheese and superbly savory.

In fact, if I'm told that there's a 2-hour wait, I usually think of it as a testament to the restaurant's popularity & potential quality, and not as a nuisance. (If I've done my homework right, I also usually know to expect it.)What I absolutely CANNOT stand, however, is an obnoxiously cavalier attitude about wasting my time. Yes, I get that your restaurant has lots of people who would really like to be seated. But no, that doesn't give you the right to give us APPALLINGLY INACCURATE wait estimates.As always, rants can get long, so I'll summarize all you need to know before the jump:Food: 3 stars - average. The cheeses were bland, sauces were pools of oil mixed with chimichurri, and the meat was nothing to write home about (though there was a lot of it). Severely disappointing, given how good Argentinian-served meat can be ... and how hungry we were (don't people normally think everything tastes good, if they've been waiting 2.5 hours to eat?).Service/Seating: gets NEGATIVE stars, because:1. the system is SO disorganized - the guy scribbles onto a pad, but there's little order (he just flips back and forth, to whatever he feels like), Even better, apparently THERE ARE MULTIPLE PADS - and you may be in one book, but not the other.Example that I witnessed:Maitre D.: \"Ma'am, I can't find your name in this book...\"The lady looks pissed and is about to start speakingMaitre D.: \"but that doesn't mean you're not on the list! Don't worry. You're probably just in his book, another book which is over there. Don't worry..\"[Hmm, if there are two separate books, and they're kept in two entirely different locations, how is coordination possible? (Here's a hint: it isn't.)]2. This terrible, terrible seating system results in ridiculously inaccurate wait times. Now, I have enough friends who have been wait staff and etc., and I understand that not everything is in their control. But to be told it's a 1 hour to 1.5 hour wait, and then only to be seated 2.5 hours later (which is a 1-1.5 hour underestimation - basically a 100% margin of error) is simply unacceptable.-----------The details - aka why I'm so angry that I'm using capslock:3:00pm - I call as soon as they open on Saturday, to get a reservation and avoid the reportedly long wait. I am told that they are not accepting reservations, and that the wait for a party of four arriving at 7pm shouldn't be bad, about 45 minutes.7:10pm - My friends and I arrive at the restaurant, we're told it'll be an hour to an hour and a half wait. Nevermind that it's about double of the 40 min estimate I heard on the phone, and nevermind that this other girl just says \"we have a reservation!\" and gets seated - I'm trying to be understanding, and just \"put my name down,\" which was essentially watching as the dude messily scribble in a small 3x5 notepad (aka that 50 cent Staples pad). We head to Dairy Queen to kill time.8:30pm - An hour and a half later, my friends and I go back to Tango Sur. The dude haphazardly flips between pages, occasionally ripping them out (and losing them to the wind) before locating mine. \"We're running behind today,\" he says. What does that mean? \"It'll be 45 more minutes.\"... uhhh, whoa. My friends look annoyed (which always stresses me out, especially since I chose the place) but when we've already waited 90 minutes, what's another 45, am I right? My friends are starving, so we order drinks & appetizers at another place.9:15pm - We still have not gotten a call from the restaurant, and it's been the full 45 minutes. Frustrated, I call the restaurant to inquire about how much longer. The guy tells me to come over.9:17pm - We arrive at the restaurant, and the dude (.. same one it's been all night) tells us we can (FINALLY) go in ... to the waiting room. Can we order food? No. But we wll get the privilege of waiting inside!Oh my god, after TWO FULL HOURS OF WAITING, I actually get to wait in the heat?! It's our big break!By now I'm SUPER pissed, because this waiting game is getting really old, really fast. I tell him that waiting inside is pretty much the same as waiting outside, and we came over here under the impression that we were going to be seated soon. He gives me sass: \"sometimes customers take longer - what do you want us to do, kick them out?\" (uh, no - but you could certainly try proactive management?)By the time we're finally seated, it is 9:40pm. That is a full TWO AND A HALF HOURS that we spent waiting, basically DOUBLE the time he initially quoted us.

I thought I deserve the best for my first visit o Chicago and made my reservation a month in advance for this place for 2 people at 7:30pm. When we arrive at this quaint sidewalk steakhouse, the person up front told us that they were running an hour behind. So me and my friend went to walk down the block to a supermarket to get a bottle of wine and then went to a neighborhood bar to have a drink. When we came back, we were told that we would need to wait another 30 minutes. I wasn't happy but I already invested in a bottle of wine and an hour, and we were hungry, so what's another 30 minutes, right? Wrong. It started to rain... hard!The outdoor patrons were moved indoors one by one, and the wait turned into another hour and a half. So we waited for about a little more than 3 hours. The horror. It's not just the wait though, it's the attitude emitted by the very smug maitre'd who couldn't care less if you leave because they will always have business. It's the rain dropped into water containers and then poured into glass of customers, it's the paisan who jumps the line without a single word. It's the total lack of empathy towards customers. Once we got inside past 10:30pm, we had bread to help with the long sufered hunger. I ordered the Parrillada Para Uno and my friend had the El Filet. The Parrillada was good other than the chewy and tough skirt steak and the overly soft blood sausage. El Filet is pretty soft and scrumptious. It's really good value for the price.

The Lomo Relleno came out a little overdone but the yummy portabella marsala sauce made up for it.

Given the number of reviews ahead of me this will only serve as white noise but I'll run you through what we ordered anyway. For starters the Spinach and Cheese Empanadas were pretty amazing. The filling had a nice blend of both and it was delicate and smooth while the empanada dough itself was tender, a little buttery and also delicate. These are a must try for sure. For a second app for our table we tried the Provoleta....Argentine provolone cheese grilled in a skillet with olive oil and mild roasted peppers. I don't recall if it was served with a bread of sorts but it should be, if you want to scoop this up even faster...though it was fantastic alone or laid over the empanada.For my entr\u00e9e, I tried the Bife Vesuvio....a prime steak stuffed with spinach and mar del plata cheese, a garlic white wine sauce over that and then served alongside an Argentine style wedge potato. All I can say is, this dish is decadent on so many levels it's a little ridiculous...my only complaint was that the potatoes weren't cooked enough for my tastes giving them a little more bite than al dente. My entr\u00e9e came with a simple salad that was a nice beginning to the end of the meal.The food aside, the ambiance is dim and a little romantic but maybe a little boisterous making it nice for groups. Given it is BYOB, and as Lucy G. noted...no corking fee, a group can have a pretty tremendous night here especially if you want to stay awhile and enjoy your evening with friends over some good wine and great conversation. It can be a little noisy as mentioned and the space is a bit cramped too but settle in and order what piques your tastes...you'll likely love this place and need to return again for more.", "Date": "2013-06-11", "Author_Location": "Ferndale, MI"}, {"Author": "Haris D.", "ReviewID": "Ei0cbmTJ4Qzjk-vv62X1YQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Simply terrible.

When you see tounges served as appetizers and sweetbreads as a sidedish...Go for it!!!! I never had sweetbreads before and I'm not sure I really want to know what it is..but I thought they were pretty good.4) Bring your own wines!!! They don't sell wines, but they allow you to bring your own,so next time I'm here..I'll be bringing bottles...heck, if you see me in the restaurant, I might be selling one of my wines for a hefty profit..gotta find a way to pay for the meal somehow!!!So overall...the place has a nice ambience, excellent for big crowds..service was pretty good, they did spill some meat juice on my lap at the end of my meal, but I was so high on meat that I didn't really care by then...and the foods were more than edible...good in my opinion, not as much according to my wife and friends.. but I was more than happy to finish their foods, even after I got done with my Lomo Relleno, which was meant for 2 people...what can i say?

But alas, one of my very dear friends was celebrating his birthday and chose to host his party here. The things I do for love. I spent an hour and a half in the car, then spent $16 to park in a lot because there was no street parking to be found.

But I was totally confused because the salad looked like what you get on the plate with a lox platter. Lettuce, two slices of tomato, and some raw white onion. Uhhh... Kay. For my entree I ordered the bone-in ribeye. I ordered it rare because there were like 20 of us and I figured my food would sit under a heat lamp. So it came out and I took my first bite and it was dry and tough. Second bite was no better. It was really dark in there, possibly to make it difficult to see an overcooked steak. But I didn't need to see it to know it was cooked to at least medium well. I consulted with the people around me and all of their steaks were overcooked too, with the exception of the girl who had the filet. That filet looked amazing. So I definitely ordered the wrong steak. The mashed potatoes were unforgivably bad. They tasted like they were 25% real potato, 75% boxed potato flakes. Mashed potatoes are like my favorite thing on the planet, but not when they come from a box. Dessert was flan.

We wish we would've gone with medium-rare as medium was a bit more than what we desired. The very innards were will pinkish red; however not much beyond that was pink.

There is a line when they open a 5pm, and the wait times start at 1.5 hours. If you are lucky and get there early and get a table, good for you. I had 4 people with me. 2 girls, 2 guys. So we brought, a six pack of nice bottle beers, 2 18 oz crafted beers, a bottle of champagne, and a bottle of wine. We had most of it before we sat down. Alcohol makes waiting easier. If you can't get into the little back waiting room they have, use the park bench at the Dairy Queen next door. (I cannot be responsible for open container violations if they happen to you.) 2.) Be prepared to wait. Just know your going to wait so you don't spoil it. 3.) Order the Empinada's. We had the meat ones, but I've heard the others are tasty as well. Sweet Fancy Moses! They are incredible! 4.) Flap Steak. It's a weird name for a delicious part of a cow. Many of there dishes are recommended for 2. Listen to them. Also, allow them to tell you how it should be prepared. It's a giant hunk of meat, and it cooks differently than a steak. So don't say medium or well done. Just ask. 5.) Bring a coat until May 25th. It was cold this weekend. And the back room may be full. 6.) Order the plate of cheese. Since you saw what we drank, I really don't remember the name of the cheese dish. It's just that. A giant plate of cheese. Eat it and shut up. You're welcome. Best steak, sweet potatoes, empendads and cheese I've had in a while. I will be going back. Might try going early. Loved it. You will too.

Don't get me wrong, I've tried on numerous occasions. I am not the kind of person that turns my nose up to a particular food group without at least giving it a shot. I have never been an avid meat eater; well, I haven't really eaten meat at all over the past 28 years or so. But, every once and a while, I give it one more try. And that is exactly what I did at Tango Sur.This is obviously an Argentine steak house and most of my friends ordered a steak dish. Each person's fillet looked absolutely scrumptious! So, I tried a bite. It was good, nice and tender, but I still just could not order an entire dish of red meat and eat it. It's not good enough for me. But again, I am an anomaly. Every person that ordered a steak absolutely loved it and as the outsider, I thought they all looked very good, with a very appealing presentation, and some tasty spinach mashed potatoes on the side.The BEST part about Tango Sur, is the BYOB. How many times have you gone out to dinner or brunch and have found your drink bill exceeds your dinner bill? This has happened to me a number of times, and it is disconcerting to say the least, but also a bit comical. Drinks are just expensive. But at Tango Sur, you can bring your own booze and that is just awesome in my mind. So, kudos to them for allowing this.They do have an assortment of poultry and fish. The tilapia looked amazing but after having ran/walked 10 miles that day, I felt like a good hearty pasta dish. So I ordered the fettucine alfredo with a side salad of mozzarella cheese, spinach and roasted red pepper.My alfredo was phenomenal. One would think this is such a simple dish and how could one screw it up? Well, this is true but there were so many interesting and complimentary flavors, that it was quite different than other alfredos I've tried. And my tastebuds where happy. The ambiance is quite cool as well.

I ordered the El Filet which is two filet mignon pieces in a red onion wine sauce and a side heap of spinach mashed potatoes. Let me make you aware that I mainly got this dish because of the raves about the spinach mashed potatoes when I was reading reviews on this place. This was the only dish that came with them.Ok, now that we have that established, let me then tell you the mashed potatoes came cold at first. My whole plate had to be taken back so I could get a hot heap of mashed potatoes. It comes back, I try them, and they are ridiculously bland. B-L-A-N-D. Oh and then the meat? I've always been used to a filet mignon being a very good cut of meat. Usually great texture, firm, and easy to cut. The two pieces of meat I had on my plate masquerading as filet mignon were mangy, rather soft with being cooked to med-well, riddled with grizzle, and rather difficult to cut. It took me dipping my pieces I worked hard to separate from the rest of the meat in my chimichurro sauce to be able to chew it. At $24 for this dish, that is just theft!I went with my mother who had the shortribs which she felt were salty, but took the rest home feeling I may still like them. When I tried them, not only were they super salty, but had even more grizzle than my filet mignons. What's up with all the grizzle? Cheap meat or bad butchering?? Probably both. They sure have a good pixie dust cloud floating about in there.Our waiter was nice, but the guy clearing our table seemed to be rushing us. Just as I don't expect anyone to hurry up with their eating so I can sit down to take my time, that shouldn't be expected of me to do for other people. As soon as we got up he pounced on the table clearing it off and taking up the paper while I was trying to put on my coat. I had to snatch my to-go bag before it ended up on the floor, or in his bin.

Hard to do without a wood-burning spit, but it can be done as evidenced at other restaurants.At Tango Sur, steaks pretty much all taste like each other - all mainly gummy, thick American steaks with a bit of seasoning to be less American.

BYOB is a great option , but you will get the corking fee, which is fine and if you have a birthday - its also $1.75 a plate for any cake that you bring. Just worth noting.Pricing seems on par with what you receive. My filet was pretty fatty and not terribly delicious compared to other places in the city. Coupled with some pretty good spinach mash potatoes though. The empanadas were good but not great. \u00a0The salad was just simple greens as well; no special dressing to note. Your rolls at dinner are maybe warm, depending on the basket, and are on par with a 24 hour diner-this was probably the most disappointing. \u00a0Nothing unique that would push me to come back.I think the hype surrounding this place has gotten the best of it. I assume at one point in time this was a great place - but now it seems all the little details that make a restaurant charming are absent. The staff is not very friendly or helpful in ordering. I'm not asking for a new friend when I meet a waiter, but maybe a \"have you been here before? Might I suggest XZY\" Just a \"what do you want?\" followed with a \"What?\". Atmosphere is extremely dark- to the point I used my phone to light portions of the menu. The candlelight is nice, but seems a little out of place for the menu/staff/decor. For a place that is so pushy on no reservations, and long lines I see all the time outside - this is most definitely not worth it to me at this point. I will probably try again, and order a different selection off the menu.If the wait and reservations wasn't such a circus, and the staff was just a little more inviting - I'd think about coming back to try again. But I can't help but feel like this is all just a way to generate hype and make it seem more exclusive and unique that what it really is. If you have some time to go here, give it a shot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here or make special arrangements.

Bad decision. I understand that this Hallmark Holiday turns a bustling city full of restaurants into a madhouse. There's a difference between a restaurant being busy; and a doorman that can't be honest with you. This review will not be about the food. This is dedicated to the staff, and level of service.First of all, I had no trouble with my waiter. The rest of the staff that was directing traffic was overwhelmed and clearly not prepared to handle the kind of customer flow in the restaurant. I am an office manager. Part of handling busy crowds is learning when you're about to bite off more than you can chew. You don't want to turn customers away; but you have to put your foot down at some point and recognize when you're compromising quality of service, and over promising on wait times. These yahoos had no idea how to run a business.First of all, it's almost like a club when you walk in. Instead of a cultural experience, you feel like you're watching a bunch of dudes pretend to be F.O.B. Eastern European when clearly they're not. I felt like every person working, who wasn't serving food, or involved with the kitchen; had an attitude like their job was beneath them. I don't normally criticize people in the customer service industry, as I work in it myself. You have to put up a front while you're working; and you need to show some compassion for the customers that are willing to wait.My date dropped me off to put our names down for a table while he hunted for street parking. I walked in the door and the look I got from the door guy came across like, \"I don't see your name on the guest list.\" Strike 1. I ask him for a table. Before I can even finish my sentence, he cuts me off and speaks condescendingly to me. \"We have a wait. It's going to be an hour.\" I respond, \"That's fine. Do you think it's possible that the wait could be longer than an hour because I don't want to wait longer.\" I didn't get a straight answer, just lots of arm gesturing, and stumbling over sentences. It was a simple question. The man is dressed like he's been working in a corporate office, with the slight flare that says, \"It's Friday and I am hitting happy hour after work.\" Pretend pretend pretend... The door guy couldn't promise me anything. I invite him to be frank, yet he still chooses to stick to his YOLO attitude, and he refuses to take accountability for any time. \"I'm sure it will be an hour, but if it runs over an hour I refuse to take blame for it.\" What the heck is that?I decide to leave my number on a list for the door guy to call me when the table is ready. I know my companion loves this restaurant so I opt to try and tolerate the staff attitude. My date and I decide to grab a drink at a bar across the street. An hour and 15 minutes go by. No phone call. So we call them. Still the same run around. By this time I am starving. \u00a0We gave it 10 more minutes and walk over. We get up to the door, and their faces automatically frown when their same lackadaisical attitude isn't tolerated from me for the third time. I am understanding. If you've made me wait an hour and a half and I have not gotten a table, then you should have been able to tell me that the wait was going to be longer than an hour when I first walked up. I expressed my distaste with whom I believe was the manager on duty. He had long hair pulled in a pony-tail. The man looks at me like his feelings are hurt. Really? Your doorman can't be realistic with me and you have the nerve to look at me like I should be keeping my mouth shut at this point? Seriously, I would have been ok with taking my business elsewhere instead of these heathens giving me the runaround, wasting my time. \u00a0 The manager's resolution to the matter is to shove my date and I into a tiny room, serving as a waiting area, already filled to the brim with unhappy couples. It was ridiculous. I wish my date would have suggested for us to leave before even going to the restaurant. After waiting in the room, the manager starts addressing me as \"senorita,\" thinking that is going to charm me into submission. I promptly responded to his dismissive attitude with what little Spanish I know; basically letting him know I am not impressed. This manager obviously thinks his appearance will compensate for his lack of experience. My date and I finally got a table. If you go, expect to dine to techno music. I really think the staff wants to be in the Nightlife industry. Not foodservice. Even then, they would be inept if they had to run a club. They'd be too busy checking their faces in the bathroom mirror. What a narcissistic staff all around. The food is just meat and potatoes, nothing special.

We followed these up with two entrees: el filet (fillet mignon topped with a red onion wine sauce and served with spinach mashed potatoes) and bife vesuvio (prime steak filed with spinach and mar del plata cheese and garlic).Although I knew the servings were going to be heaping, I was still stunned to see that my fillet mignon was actually two perfectly prepared steaks, well complimented by the spinach mashed potatoes. The green lump on my plate was a little odd-looking but tasted heavenly.The bife vesuvio was also delicious, although, quite honestly, we felt it was even better the second day.Tango Sur is a bit noisy - my boyfriend initially thought that his parents would enjoy the restaurant but decided it was a bad idea since his father would not be able to hear a word anyone was saying. We even struggled a bit, and this was on a Monday night.Still, I liked this aspect of the experience. Even on that snowy Monday night, the room was alive with conversation, as diners enjoyed their exquisite food and wine.My time at Tango Sur was so wonderful that I cannot wait to go back.

Yes, you can get a \"contact hipster\" just by walking through a group of them. Thankfully we survived, but we should have noted the omen as we got to the restaurant. Tango Sur only takes \"reservations\" for groups of 6 or more, we had 7, perfect. We had called almost a week prior to dining and expected to wait no more than 15-20 minutes. I'm not unrealistic, I know that even with a larger group and a reservation, you're not going to get seated right on time. However, what I was not expecting was to be told it would be 45 minutes.... which then turned into 90 minutes. But don't worry, at about the hour mark we were lead into a back \"waiting room\" which felt like an old Chinese opium den, but instead of opium it was wine and instead of toothless, chinese tweakers, it was disgruntled people waiting for tables at a mediocre restaurant. Definitely not a place a woman would want to be alone...2 bottles of wine and 30 minutes later our shackles were finally broken and we were liberated to our table. We started by cracking 2 more bottles of wine to try and wash the opium flavor out of our mouths and then ordered chicken and beef empanadas as well as some sort of cheese plate. The beef empanadas were actually really good and brought me back into the spirit of the food. I almost just ordered 2 more plates of those for my entre, but sadly I did not and regretted it later. The waiter eventually made his way back to us and took our orders... everyone ordered El Filet. I was actually going to order something else, but the waiter successfully up-sold me to the filet-medium. The salads came out and I was a little disappointed. As my fiance pointed out, the lettuce and tomato looked like what you would get on the side when you order a cheeseburger. Literally 3-5 pieces of lettuce flat on a plate with 2 slices of tomato on top of it; oil and vinegar are your only dressing options. Not too long after the salads our filets came out. If I had known that each filet order was 2, 8-10 oz filets more of us would have shared, especially since mine was definitely medium rare and not medium. The medium rare steaks at the table were still breathing. The filet sat in a pool of sauce, which to me usually means they are trying to mask the flavor. The steak wasn't bad, the sauce was good and the spinach mashed potatoes were ok... needless to say I wasn't impressed with the food we waited almost 2 hours for (with a reservation).

This is a no fuss, BYOB, potato tortilla ( hint this is not a traditional tortilla), BYOB, wait for 3 hours for a hunk-a-chunka piece of red meat kind of place.I shared a rib eye with a friend along with the potato tortilla, and some empanadas and I was stuffed beyond stuffed. I definitely didn't finish my food, partly because I was full but partly because I didn't find my food very appealing. The meat was way too fatty. The potato tortilla was not what I expected. It was more like a frittata and not so much a tortilla the way I know of tortillas. The salad was very atypical of what you would expect for a salad - it was 2 large lettuce leaves, a slice of tomato and a slice of red onion with a DIY dressing of oil and red wine vinegar.I think the true test of a restaurant comes to this, would you come to this place again? To that I would answer, no. Maybe if I lived in the Chicago area, but since I don't, I'm more inclined to try other restaurants, vs. coming to this establishment again. So, my advice, go here once, if you are in the area and try it for yourself. But, come here knowing that you might have to wait an hour or more for a table, and that you shouldn't expect a fancy 5 star steakhouse.", "Date": "2012-04-25", "Author_Location": "Walnut Creek, CA"}, {"Author": "K.

Kind of like ex-Bull Dennis Rodman, I celebrate my birthday week not just the day itself. We started by walking up to the much hyped Tango Sur at 9:45 on a Saturday night. The pompous host-not a ma\u00eetre d', took our name, cell # and promised to call within the hour. While patiently waiting down the street at Cullens, for well over an hour, we walked back to Tango Sur. When we walked up to the host stand, pompous host himself looks at us, asks what we need. Wife: {scowl on face} Me: Welllll, I'm \" Scott B.\" and you said that you'd call \"within the hour?\" Pompous Host: Oh, Scott, I tried calling you. Me: I pulled my phone out of pocket, and showed him that there were no missed calls. Pompous Host: Uhhhh, oh, maybe I called someone else. Me: Uhhh, yeah, maybe that's the case. The pompous prick of a host, walked in \"to check\" if a table was available. About five minutes later, he, from a distance, waives us inside. I guess he skipped the manners class as a child? With so much hype and extreme demand for a table, I was expecting to see Hugo Chavez and Sean Penn sharing a bottle of wine. Fortunately, this was not the case, but the place was buzzing. After finally being seated, I opened my mind, and was looking forward to Tango Sur living up to their Yelp-a-tation. About 10 minutes later a server came by with some wine glasses, and opened our bottle of wine. (No corkage fee) Both wifey & I did notice that the prices seemed quite low for the entrees. The server took our order, and both of us opted for the \"El Filet\" at a very reasonable price of $24. As discussed, the server took our order, but not without asking on 3 separate occasions if we wanted an appetizer. I wasn't aware that after 38 years, I just picked up a speech impediment? About 30 minutes later (getting hungry), the \"El Filets\" were delivered to our table. Jesus! What a lot of meat! The \"El Filet\" is actually 2 filets, that are probably at least 10 ounces each. Of course I was thinking, how the hell could they sell \"prime\" beef at these prices. The \"El Filets\" were accompanied with spinach mashed potatoes. Now, these were some damn good mashed potatoes. The filets though were average, at best. Granted, they were prepared at a perfect medium rare, but this \"grass fed\" crap was hardly prime beef, in my opinion. What I do credit Tango Sur on is the brilliant marketing team that successfully presents this sham as a first class place for steaks. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! Just place a trendy restaurant in the affluent Southport corridor, and they'll come! Won't return. I'll gladly pay $42 for a true prime steak at Kinzie, Keefers, or Ruth's, where I'm treated like a majority shareholder, and the quality of the steaks are second to none.", "Date": "2010-07-25", "Author_Location": "Tyler, TX"}, {"Author": "Penny P.", "ReviewID": "1y4Jq2UndvlK1yag-R2wjQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's not to love?BYOB, great salads and warm bread, empanadas with garlic sauce, and sharing a big plate of meat and sweet potatoes over a grill.I've probably been to this restaurant more times than any other in the city, and it's because it's always consistently fantastic. \u00a0 We love to take two bottles of red wine ('cause we inevitably end up drinking one while waiting for a table!) and order the Vacio to share. \u00a0 In fact, when we were in Napa we actually bought a few bottles specifically for our next trip to Tango Sur. \u00a0Oh, and it's Southport, so you also get in some good people-watching, which is always a plus for nosy gals like me.", "Date": "2008-05-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Alli L.", "ReviewID": "vculpj2hJDg_Bgp3mUPJDw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Oh Tango, how I love thee. 1.

(umm, spoiler alert, I guess) You know the part where they find the other half of the plane with the suitcases and one of the dudes opens it and finds toothpaste? He squeezes the toothpaste into his mouth like it's the best thing he's ever eaten because the only thing he's had to eat in a really long time is his teammates? Well, I think the hype about this food just comes from waiting too long. By the time some of these other reviewers sat down, they'd eat toothpaste and call it the best meal ever. I'm not buying it. This is one of those places we've been wanting to try forever since it always gets good reviews, but anytime we think of it, the wait is too long. So, my birthday rolled around on a Tuesday night and we figured that it would be a good night to go to try this place. We made a reservation. When we got there, there was only one other table, so we had our pick of tables and had no wait. To start, we picked the wrong table. We sat outside at a two-top close to the window so we'd be out of the sun. Unfortunately, a leaky air conditioner from a window above had completely saturated the awning, so we were dripped on throughout the entire meal. The place was packed by the time it wasn't really funny anymore, so there was no where for us to go. I know this wasn't necessarily the restaurant's fault, but maybe they should not put a table there? Just a thought. Our waiter came over to the table, opened our bottle of wine (leaving the foil torn and jagged. Such a small detail, but it was noticed) and left us with empty water glasses for about 10 minutes. Finally, someone came by and gave us some water. They dumped some bad bread rolls on our table and away they went. A few minutes later, the waiter returns and says \"are you ready to order?\" Now, call me picky, but good service usually includes the waiter introducing himself and asking if we'd ever been there before. The menu was not really self explanatory, but the waiter seemed in too much of a hurry to ask. We took a stab and ordered what looked good. \u00a0We ordered 2 empanadas- one con carne and one with spinach and cheese. Both were good. However, the busboy came and swept away our plates before we were finished. Just because I put my fork down does not mean you can take my plate. I hate that! Next were the salads. I understand this is a steak house, but the salad was pretty disappointing. The lettuce was not fresh at all, and that's pretty much all the salad is: lots of wilted lettuce, 2 slices of tomato, 3 slices of onion, oil and vinegar. It was bad. Next came our steaks. I had the boneless strip steak. My husband had the short rib. The steaks were good. I ordered mine medium rare, and it came out medium rare. It had a good flavor to it. However, it was really fatty (is that normal for a strip steak? I don't even know), and the knives were really dull so it was difficult to cut. My husband ordered his medium and it came out medium well but he enjoyed it. Then our bill came, and it was less than we spent at a local pub a week ago, so they have that going for them. I'd go between 2 and 3 stars for this place, so count this as a 2.5 stars. Decent steaks and good prices, but no frills. I don't understand the wait for this place. I wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes for this meal, and that's just because I know I'd be getting a deal on a steak, which is never really my first choice when eating out anyway.", "Date": "2010-08-11", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mike P.", "ReviewID": "bQmXo8wij4eVrrIsXZ7ipQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think I've just about played out my string at Tango Sur. \u00a0I was there for a dinner party last night and one of my fellow dinners was treated \"less than excellent\" by our server. \u00a0She just wanted to be sure that she received the correct entree, and as a result was subject to a 5 minute interrogation by our server and the manager. \u00a0Not as bad as I'm making it sound, but not OK for one of the best steakhouses on the north side. \u00a0Also, while I'm sure there was no malice intended and it might be partly due to a language barrier, when serving a female customer her food, saying \"Here's your steak, lady\" \u00a0sounds pretty derogatory. \u00a0Again, my perception of the event probably exaggerates the situation and otherwise service is good and the food is great. \u00a0And good for them that they fill the house every night. \u00a0I just think I'm ready to move on to other places. \u00a0Maybe I'm just getting old.", "Date": "2010-08-26", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Christy L.", "ReviewID": "3gpuC5x9-IW7di7cpyZFNw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Tango Sur is one of the best values in Chicago! \u00a0A BYOB Argentine steakhouse, you can get in and out for less than $50 a couple. \u00a0In fact, if you're not a huge eater, I recommend splitting an appetizer and entree between two people, and you could probably eat dinner (with wine) for less than $30! \u00a0The fillet dinner is actually two 8-9 ounces tenderloins, which are easily shareable. \u00a0Other cuts of meat are also large though not necessarily already split in two.Be prepared to wait if you arrive after 6pm on weekend night! \u00a0It's no secret that Tango Sur is such a great value. \u00a0There is a small room in the back where you can start imbibing while waiting to be seated. \u00a0Also, the restaurant is loud, which makes it challenging with a large group and/or older dining companions.", "Date": "2012-02-05", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Christmas D.", "ReviewID": "rljBvGQrK3vhMnKjhD-9Bw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would go 3 1/2 stars if I could...I really like this restaurant so I was surprised by the very mixed reviews. \u00a0Perhaps consistency isn't their strong point. \u00a0 Anyway...I've been here a few times but I will review my most recent visit.Five of us walked in early Sunday evening and were seated right away. \u00a0I was concerned that they wouldn't have seating for little people but it turns out they are a very family-friendly place. \u00a0I found the staff to be very attentive. \u00a0Our waiter explained the difference between the beef offered on the menu (from Canada) and that offered on the specials menu (South American). \u00a0He was very helpful in recommending dishes.We skipped the apps. and just ordered entrees. \u00a0I was pleased to discover that entrees came with a salad but it did leave a bit to be desired. \u00a0It was iceburg lettuce with onion slivers, tomato, served with oil and vinegar. \u00a0If they had just chosen a better lettuce I probably wouldn't diss it at all. \u00a0But a salad is such a simple thing to improve upon seems an easy way to up their ratings.I ordered the Bif Vesuvio, medium rare. \u00a0This is, hands down, one of the tastiest steak dished I have ever had. \u00a0However, despite my temperature request, the meat was WAY too rare. \u00a0Actually, all of our steaks were significantly more rare than we'd ordered them. \u00a0I suppose it's better to undercook than overcook. \u00a0Had my son not been with us I would've sent it back for them to cook more. \u00a0Instead, I ate the ends (which was actually plenty) and took the rest home. \u00a0by the time I reheated the leftovers, it was cooked perfectly!The sauce they serve the steak with is super-garlic-heavenly (they gave me extra to take home with my left-overs), the potatoes were AMAZING. \u00a0Other than the undercooked meat, the rest of my family was also quite pleased with the place and have said they will definitely go back.", "Date": "2007-05-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Brad B.", "ReviewID": "7DbnaFlzqeszwgugYbBIqg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Tango Sur has been reviewed to death already So, I'm just going to keep this brief.Great food.

I had skirt, wife had flank - which they peculiarly call \"flap\" on the menu, though luckily the waiter called it what it really is - flank (flap is a totally different cut: a thin, low sirloin.

It actually burnt my mouth - and I like garlic. Mushy boiled then baked potatoes (the only side) were likewise slathered in garlic and too much salt.

As a youngin' I would go to the store for the amazing empanadas and leter for other Spanish products. They have also always had a butcher shop there in the store. This same family started Tango sur after I moved away from home. \u00a0The restaurant next door was a real disappointment. Tango Sur is a Argentine style steakhouse that is BYO. The restaurant is cramped with the tables really close to eachother, which sometimes makes for an interesting place to go. But these tables are so tight that not even the waiters can get through let alone the people trying to come and go from there table. People were brushing arms (and asses) against me throughout the evening. At one point I found myself tugging on a guys sportcoat that was leaving because his ass was literally on my table. The guy was cool and apologized. Ok no big deal on that, again a crowd sometimes makes a place fun. On to the food. I started with the empanadas, which were ok, not fabulous. We ordered an equal amount of spinach and of ground beef. They were half as good as the ones sold at the corner store. The chimichurri sauce, a sauce with olive oil, parsley, garlic and other things was pretty bland. I then ordered Berenjena (Eggplant) for another appetizer. The ingredients of prociutto, rio de plata cheese and the tomato cream sauce sounded like a nice marriage ok, scratch good marriage, they sounded good, but this too was not tasty. Then came the meat dishes. Upon the waiters recommendation for the most tender meat, I ordered something called 'vacio' which served two. The presentation of this looked great, brought out on a platter that keeps cooking on your table it was in a nice sauce and with sweet potatoes in the sauce. But the meat was horrible, like a really big, poor quality cut and really chewy. After a bit or two I left it. The serving could have served many people. Like five or six. My son and girlfriend ordered the 'parillada variado'(assorted grilled meats) which comes with sausages, a few cuts of different steak, morsillas which are a blood sausage and pork sausages. Morsillas which are I think Spanish, but made in many places in latin america were just ok with each adding their own touch. The steak on the platter contained was really fatty, like unhealthy to eat due to the amount of fat in each bite. When I told the waiter that what I ordered but far from what he described, he removed it and later returned to say he would take it off my account which I didn't expect but which I appreciated.Service I found was better than the food, as waiters were courteous and very attentive.

Tango Sur is the real deal with grass fed beef that will melt in your mouth and will NOT give you mad cow disease due to stricter testing standards in, um, every country in the world besides the US? The empanadas are delicious and are available filled with spinach, ham, or beef (of course!). Vegetarian options are also available in beef dreamland, with pasta, veggie, and fish dishes available for non-carnivores. Make sure you get the potatoes, whether they are spinach mashed or fried. Save some of your bread for dipping in the to-die-for aioli sauce that comes with the steaks.Portions are HUGE as most meals come with two fillets. I will never forget when my Dad turned to look at me with the joy of a 10-year-old boy with illegal fireworks and said \"You mean...I get TWO?\" Dad's pleasure was further enhanced by the fact that this place is a BYOB beauty. We even got up in the middle of dinner to go restock at the CVS down the street. That NEVER happens.Tango Sure has definitely become a family tradition. Also, contrary to popular belief, Tango Sur does offer reservations, but only for parties of 6 or more. If you DO have to wait, the staff will take your cell phone number so you can go hang out in one of the numerous bars on Southport. Since Argentines eat later than most Americans, you will have better luck with seating if you go earlier, around 6 or 7PM. Weekend afternoons are also pleasantly vacant. And trust me, you will encounter lots of Argentines.

I fell in love with the T-bone. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare, please) and was about 3 inches thick, covered in some kind of delicious spice blend.

I was ready for this and so was my bf. But then, the host looked at us and said, \"Hold on.

In fact, I wish I had gotten his name. I also love to compliment the waitstaff to the manager. Unfortunately, I just forgot. We ordered one beef and one chicken empanada. I don't know what the green sauce is they serve with it, but it just really bumps up the flavor. We also had the melted cheese plate. What's not to love? Melty cheese, bread. yes please. For our entree we split one of the steaks for two. The one with the chimichurri. It was fantastic. My bf was a bit skeptical on getting it medium rare (he wanted medium), but both I and the waiter said it was the right way for this. Medium rare was definitely the way. And there was the fantastic green sauce again! We didn't even finish half of the steak. It was so big. We did take it home and the next morning made some steak and eggs for breakfast. Cooked up quite nicely. For dessert, the waiter brought out a caramel flan that he gave us for my bf's birthday. AwesomeI love that this place is byob. Really cuts down on the cost.

I am so glad my friend discovered this place and invited me because my life would be a little sadder without it. The first time I ever went to Tango Sur was on a Monday night and the place was slammed! After going there more, I realized that they are always servery night of the week. If you do not like a loud, fast paced restaurant, you will not like Tango Sur. The atmosphere it dark, candlelit, and romantic, with every table so close that you could definitely touch the people at the table next to you; not that you would want to, but for the sake of description... What adorns the romantic atmosphere are the beautiful people, called waiters that glide around the restaurant. Ladies (and fellas too), this restaurant has some of the most beautiful men working as wait staff that I've seen in the city of Chicago. So down to business...One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the warm bread they give you as soon as you sit down. The rolls are so fresh. Perfectly crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. I could just eat bread here. For appetizers, I would recommend any of the empinadas. The garlic oil they give you with the empinadas (as well as many entrees) is fabulous! Entrees come with a salad. It's not your run of the mill salad; it's lettuce, two tomatoes and some onions. You get oil and vinegar as a dressing. Simple, classic and perfect because a lot of people tend to get full on salads before the meal. I always get whatever special fish they have because I don't eat steak, but everyone who I have come with who ordered steak found it to be wonderful. At Tango Sur, you really get your money's worth of steak. A favorite is the Filet mignon, in which you are served TWO filets and it's only $24. It's a steal! I've seen many people order the dinner for two, in which you get a hot plate of a variety of scrumptious meats. I generally don't order dessert here because for one, I'm not a huge dessert person, and two because i'm so FULL and satisfied that I don't need dessert! But the dessert I have tried has been good. There's a peaches and creme dessert that is heavenly. Tango Sur is a great restaurant with awesome Argentinian food. The restaurant has a great ambiance that is perfect for a date. The only downsides are that it is ALWAYS busy and the tables are close together. In addition, if you don't have a party of 6 or more to make a reservation, you will probably end up waiting. Try calling ahead to put your name on the list, and if you do have to wait, take a stroll to Jewel or CVS down the street to buy some drinks for dinner...it really makes time go by.

I'd say it's a must get. For dinner we did the Lomo Relleno and Para Dos. My oh my. The Lomo is huge, bursting with flavor, incredibly tender, expertly cooked (mid-rare), and a sauce that's unlike any other.The para dos is so fun to eat with friends. I love sweetbreads, so it's a personal treat that they include this with all the other meat. The short ribs, flap meat, and sausage are all really good too.

I had like two bites of the potatoes (which are like roasted potato wedges doused in butter), but focused on the meat. They also give you a great red wine / shallot/ garlic sauce to dip the meat in.

Just not exactly what I had pictured in my mind's eye - but that only knocks off a star.I'm saving this for the last because I don't think it's quite as important as the fact that we had a delicious meal, but the front of house service was not my favorite. I made the reservation two weeks in advance and got a confirmation call the day of; great, right? But we got there three minutes late for our reservation and only then did they tell us that they were 15-20 minutes behind with their reservations - and on top of that, there was no room to wait in the restaurant! They had my number, so why didn't they call? I'm sure a large percentage of their patrons are within walking or a 15 minute drive range, so why wouldn't they let us know beforehand? That's really my only complaint. I love the fact that it's byob (I'm new to this whole byob-in-chicago thing) and we saved a ton of money but still had a great meal.

It had been on there a while until i finally made it for dinner last night.Dinner was a \"Grub With Us\" meal with a group of six others (it was booked for a group of eight. Simple math: two people don't show up=more food for us!). The place looked great from the inside: map of Argentina on the wall, various paintings on other walls. Plus there was a \"roving\" guitarist playing various salsa and other types of Spanish music. (I think a Gypsy Kings tune was played once during the night). The waiter was very pleasant as well.Now of the food. The special menu that we had included chicken empanadas (I'm a big fan of empanadas, whether it be here or any other Spanish restaurant), spinach ravioli (yum), berejena (eggplant w/spinach, cheese, and tomato sauce), and three meat dishes(short ribs, skirt steak, and flap steak). The flan that we had for dessert was nice and creamy. The only bad part about the experience (and the reason for the two star deduction) was the noise level. I hated screaming across the table to my dinner companions. The live music was nice, but to me it added to the noise that drowned out the conversation.

The place is too cramped, we were sitting in a table right next to the door - cold air coming in with every patron. The wait staff was nice for the most part, but there was a waiter that didn't like us very much until we started speaking to him in Spanish, before then he seemed annoyed at every request for water we made.

I'd go there just for that... but given I don't love potatoes that much, there goes that. With all honesty however - Please take my review with a grain of salt. I've heard many many wonderful things about this restaurant, it is actually too bad they don't take reservations. I am not the person to listen to when deciding to go here, since I don't particularly love meat - I'd rather have fish any day, than cow. So with that said, do know that the waits are usually super long, they don't take reservations, and don't sit at the table near the door if it's open - it is super uncomfortable.

Tango Sur is, hands down, the best restaurant that I've been to in Chicago so far. Granted, I've only been here for 24 hours. We had the empanadas (my first time!) with spinach and cheese, and beef. The spinach and cheese empanadas came highly recommended by the waiter, but to my surprise, both me and the boy preferred the beef. Regardless, the empanadas = fabulous. They were fried, but the dough was light and perfectly crisp. The waiter took the time to walk us through the history of empanadas, which was appreciated.The name of the steak for 2 that we ordered escapes my mind, but it's safe to say that if you say, \"I want the steak for 2 with all the yams around it,\" the waiter will understand. It's marinated and surrounded by a DELICIOUS chimichurri sauce that I repeatedly scooped on to my sweet potatoes. Warning -- the portions of this steak are HUGE. 22 ounces. Yowza!The only reason why I give Tango Sur 4 stars instead of 5 is because our silverware was repeatedly dirty. And by dirty, I mean that there was leftover spinach on our forks.

It's like that ex gf that you just can't stop drunk dialing.Came on a Monday night at 8pm, beautiful weather so their patio was full. Host said 15-20 minutes for a table outside. Just as we thought it was our turn when we saw a table open up, he gave it to another couple. I swear we had been there longer, but I' wasn't going to complain. Just our luck, no one was leaving at that time and we ended up waiting an hour for a table. So incredibly frustrating, additionally because they had a table for 6 empty but they wouldn't seat us, a party of 2, at it. However, you just can't argue with the food. The menu is a bit overwhelming so just go with the recs from Yelp. Empanadas are brilliantly good. Flaky crust and oozing fillings, and very reasonably priced at $2 apiece. We got the ham and cheese and the spinach and cheese. I easily could have eaten all 5 varieties. We wanted to get the Provoleta, Argentine provolone cheese cooked on the grill witholive oil and roasted peppers... sounds and looked amazing. Oozing when it came out to the table next to us, but after eating the entire basket of bread, there was no way we would have room. Next time, but how will I pass on the empanadas?? As usual, the el filet did not disappoint. A perfect medium rare, this range grown fillet mignon, cooked on the grill then topped with a red onion wine sauce is simply delectable. The meat almost melts in your mouth. Two big cuts of filet, one for dinner and another for tomorrow's lunch. At $27, you think this may be expensive but trust me, it's incredibly reasonable for their portion sizes. The sauce and chimachurri sauce on the side is delicious.The Bife Vesuvio, another one of their most popular dishes, was also a winner. Slightly tougher since it is only cooked to one temperature. This grilled prime steak silced and filled with spinach, mar del plata cheese and garlic in a white wine sauce is not flattering on your breath so beware if you're on a date. I recommend the filet in that instance. I was able to bring ALL the leftovers to work with me today, so half of the el filet and half of the vesuvio. I must say, the filet holds up better overnight and is still unbelievably tender and succulent even when reheated. The Vesuvio was a little more oily but still very good as leftovers.

This thing was a huge portion.The marinade was very tasty. The spinach and cheese filling was very tasty. The downside was the steak itself. Not very tender, and even rubbery in some areas.

Review # 406. Yeah, yeah, Tango Sur is the shizzle. We all know that. I am adding this review because I want to testify to ti's authenticity. I spent winter break from law school in Argentina \"studying abroad\" - AKA enjoying summer in the southern hemisphere, gawking at the world's most beautiful women (Brazil Schmazil), eating steak almost every night for insane, ridiculous, almost criminally cheap prices, drinking LOTS of good Argentine wine, and not knowing how to communicate (I don't speak Spanish). But I digress. Tango Sur is EXACTLY like a meal you would get at an upscale Argentine steakhouse. First, the salad (which one reviewer described as \"plain jane\") is identical to the salads that accompany most dinner entrees- onions, lettuce, tomato, oil & vinegar- that's it. Second, the empanadas are crispy, flaky, tender, and delicious- just like the best ones I had during my stay. All of the fillings are delish. Third, the MEAT. Skirt steak, ribeye, filet, blood sausage- all wonderful and all authentic. Chimichurri is exquisite. I want it at the table for every meal from now on. But if you REALLY want to experience a true Argentine meal, order the Parilla. It's a small grill brought to your table, covered in all sorts of stuff like sweetbreads, intestines/ chitlins, sausage, chicken, beef- not for the faint of heart. You'll experience meat-sweats, your body will hate you in the morning, and you can forget about getting any post-meal action for a few hours, but it's worth it.

We had reservations thankfully (accepted for 6+ people). The expected wait time here sans reservation will likely be 45 min - 1.5 hrs. We finally got seated 30 minutes after our reservation. But I was with mostly guys who didn't care that much. So if you don't like to wait, you won't like this part.

The people are very eclectic and it feels like a small European restaurant (even though the place is pretty big).Food:Ridiculous. I love steak. I ordered the prime rib rare. They give you a ton of food here. It was mouth-watering. My friends ordered the filet with the red wine sauce - unbelievable. The best steak I've had in a long time. The sides are so-so. But we didn't come here for veggies. So I would recommend ordering the steak and just a small side rather than the pre-made combinations.Drinks:BYOB - enough said. AmazingService:This is the only bad part of this place. The service staff here rushes you and you feel like you need to clear the table for the next group. But it's understandable. They are packed and they need to clear space. \u00a0The waiter screwed up on the rare-ness of 1 of our orders and brought out a completely different order for another guy.

We got there around 7:45pm and were concerned about finding parking in the area. There is no parking lots in the area so you're left to find street parking in the surrounding neighborhood. Fortunately, we found something at the next block. We put our name in and the host informed us it would be a 30 minute wait. We could leave a cell phone with him and he'd call us or we could wait on the bench outside. Since it was fairly nice outside, we chose to wait. 30 minutes wait doesn't really seem so bad considering stories of people having to wait to 2 hours to get in. Beware if you are a \"party of 2\". This is a very popular date place and there are lots of \"party of 2's\" Since this place is very small, they do not have very many tables for just 2 people so you will have to wait for a table of 4 to open up. And they do not take reservations for any party under 6 so keep than in mind as well. You will most likely have at least 3 or more \"party of 2's\" waiting ahead of you.Be prepared for Tango Sur first timers to pull the old \"but I'm leaving for Iraq tomorrow\", \"its my girlfriend's birthday today\", \"we are celebrating an anniversary\", \"we called earlier and were told we could get in right away\" type of utter BS that people pull to get the host to bump them up in the queue. We were seated at around 8:45 pm and by this time were really starving. It would really be nice if the restaurant perhaps offered bread or even chips to patrons waiting. It certainly \u00a0would not cost them a whole bunch and might soften the blow of having to wait so long. Our server gave me a visual hello to let me know he saw us sit down but it seemed like a good 10 minutes passed before someone came over to cork our bottle of wine and get our order. We were sat at a table meant for 4 people dead center in the middle of the dining room.Tables are spaced very very close together. You really feel like you are on top of everyone. Since this place is so popular, I'm sure they want to squeeze as many tables in as they can, but honestly, they could do with removing some of the tables and just having people suck it up and wait longer. As others have mentioned, there is no cork fee so bring yer own. Be forewarned though that they do not leave the cork with you so if you are not planned to drink it all, you might not be able to take your remaining wine with you when you leave. I drank all but a half glass so I have no idea if I could have taken the remaining bottle or not. Bring your own cork or wine stopper with you if you foresee this happening. As to the ambience of the place, its very nice but with that many people in tight quarters, it can get a bit loud. The music is played at a reasonable level and the tables are all candle lit and the lights are down fairly low. I guess if you like that sort of thing, but honestly, I would rather see my food a bit better. I'm a bit of a picky eater, see, and I'd like to see what's on my plate a bit better. The bread was pretty standard. The butter at the table, to my chagrin, was not whipped butter but just regular butter packets that they bought in bulk. The problem with this is the butter packets tend to be a little hard and not easy to spread. But seeing as they were sat close to the candle, they were a bit softer. Still, nice whipped butter would bring it up a bit. My husband and I got the Provoleta appetizer which was delicious but definately a lot of cheese to eat for 2 people especially if you are also eating bread, drinking wine and having salads and your entree. It took quite a long time to receive our salads, which was questionable considering its really nothing more than some leaf lettuce, tomato slices and some red onion with oil on a plate. Not really a \"salad\" in my book. I ended up giving the husband the majority of what was on my plate. My husband ordered the Pez which was fish and potatos. And I ordered the Vacio which was flat steak and potatos. The Vacio comes with sweet potatos but if you prefer mashed, they will get that for you instead. The Vacio is meant for 2 people but since I like my meat and want left overs (which was enough for 2 more meals). The serving of meat was huge; definately much more than 2 peoples worth (unless those 2 people are really big eaters). Three people could easily have enough of meat but the potato portions might be slim. It was blood red rare just as I like it. Chimichurri sauce was abundant and I ordered extra to take with me. Our total plus tip was around $90, which is pretty steep. But I got 2 more meals out of it so its not that bad.

\u00a0But looking back I should have seen the warning signs. \u00a0I mean, once a server argued with me when I politely informed him the empanadas he delivered to the table were cheese and spinach when we had actually ordered chicken. \u00a0\"No, you ordered spinach and cheese.\" \u00a0Um. \u00a0What. \u00a0So I guess I shouldn't be surprised about the actions of the staff last night....I arrived with my parents, a couple of friends, and one Tango Sur virgin at 7:55PM for our 8:00PM reservation. \u00a0We were told we were the next table to be seated once a six top left so we were kindly escorted to the waiting area where we were told we could pop our wine while we waited - standard practice. \u00a0We waited several minutes for glasses and when none came, I sought out the host and asked if we could have a few glasses for our beverages. \u00a0I was told they were short on glasses but that some should be available shortly. \u00a0I won't go into too much detail about what transpired over the next hour of waiting in that room but let's just say, an hour wait when you supposedly have a reservation is made tolerable by drinking wine...however, because over that hour no glasses were ever made available to us, we sat staring at our full bottles of wine...and at each other...agitation growing by the minute. \u00a0I politely checked on the status of the glasses a few times while we waited always being told they were coming. \u00a0And when checking on our status in line - \"you're next.\" \u00a0But once the clock struck 9PM, my frustration could no longer be contained. \u00a0My guests were yawning, and I was hungry. \u00a0So I approached a server and asked if we could get ANY glasses - whether that be a coffee mug, water glass, just something so we could ease our frustrations of waiting an hour with some wine. \u00a0 His response... \"PLEASE!!! \u00a0Can you have some glasses, PLEASE!! \u00a0As you can see we don't have any and NO we won't give you ANY glass. \u00a0We'll give you WINE glasses when they are available but we don't have any.\" \u00a0 As if the hour we had already waited for our RESERVATION wasn't bad enough, tears welled up in my eyes from being berated in front of fellow patrons. \u00a0And with that, we packed up our belongings and headed for the door. \u00a0As we approached the host he pointed to our table thinking we were coming to sit, but we continued on, letting him know we would be dining elsewhere. \u00a0Management followed behind to find out why we were unhappy but the apology didn't feel sincere, nor did they make much of an attempt to convince us to stay and make things right - after all, they probably had another pissed off party of six they could seat once they wiped their hands clean of us. \u00a0All the while I was wiping tears away, completely embarrassed as diners observed our exchange.Honestly, my feelings are hurt. \u00a0After all this time, and so much loyalty to this business, in the end I found out I'm just another customer to them...really less than that. \u00a0Ironically, my server from my very first visit in 2004 happened to be the very same gentleman who followed us out to issue an apology. \u00a0I'm sure he sees so many people in and out, he probably didn't make the connection - perhaps if he had, he would have tried harder to save the relationship.Break ups are hard. \u00a0But there are plenty of fish in the sea. \u00a0Or in this case, steaks in the city. \u00a0And I intend to find one served with a side of customer appreciation.", "Date": "2012-10-13", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Adam A.", "ReviewID": "EQFyL0wJJ3FKMC7MtqbPTg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've never had a very pleasant experience at Tango Sur.

I called at 5:01 (they open at 5) and scored a reso for 3 at 8:30. I was jumping for joy. We got there 15 minutes earlier and was informed it would be about a 15 min wait. We were escorted to the back waiting room where other patrons waiting had already popped their bottles. As we were about to the do the same, my name was called. Just walking from the entrance to the waiting room and the waiting room to the table, I was already so excited to be here. It is completely pitch black and the main source of lighting is by a single candle on each table, making is extremely romantic. There's loud, sorta samba/electronic music playing that I would compare to Sushi Samba's or shopping at Express. It definitely sets the mood for a fun group or date experience without being too mushy, serious or cheesy. The tables were spacious enough that I couldn't really hear the couple next to me. The seating is half booth and half chairs. I sat on the booth side.Our waiter greeted us immediately and helped pop open our wine bottles (BYOB!!). We ordered 1 ham and cheese and 1 spinach and cheese empanada (I think $3 each?). I don't eat ham (pescatarian here) but my fiance and friend enjoyed the spinach one better. The chimichurri is to die for. I literally drowned everything in it and could drink it if I could. I even started googling \"How to make chimichurri\" at the table because I need this in my life on a regular basis. I ordered the eggplant ($10!) as my dish and LOVED it. Someone on yelp compared it to an eggplant lasagna and I would agree. It is drowning in a creamy, cheesy red sauce and is thinly layered with eggplant. Everyone loved my dish, and it was big enough to share. My fiance ordered the filet medium rare ($27 I think?), which he was impressed with and my friend ordered the churrasco ($22) medium rare as well. The churrasco was cooked well-done. He said it was extremely chewy and hard. My friend had split the filet with my fiance and was already full, so he asked the waiter if they could just take it off the bill. The waiter had to present the steak to the cook and sure enough, apologized and removed it from the bill. To make up for it, they gave us a complimentary flan which was pretty good and I'm not even a flan person. The portions are ridiculously large and I would suggest people split entrees with they plan to have appetizers and wine. There's just no way to eat it all yourself. The steaks came with sides. I had some of the mashed potatoes (awesome with chimichurri on top) and there were fries with the churrasco. I can see how crazy packed this place can get as it was at full capacity on a Wed night. I definitely suggest you call ahead and make reservations and get there a little earlier. Also, smiling and being super nice to the staff also helps, as I was. Because it's a packed house, our waiter was a little MIA for a moment, but that's understandable as I'm sure he was helping multiple tables at the same time.

Finding Tango Sur was a great thing. My travel partner and I found the place when asking around in Lincoln Park, and headed there on the detail given by the random person on the street, and how they looked as they recanted eating there... almost like they went there a moment and left the sidewalk in front of me. \u00a0lolThe advice was good. I was uncertain about the place, as we arrived RIGHT at the time before the place gets busy, finding a place to park very close by. The wait staff was very good, with questions and the patience with the indecision of my cohort. The expediters and bus-boys very on it. Waters filled, and others wine bottles opened and served what seemed to be efficiently. \u00a0Being the only ones there when we arrived, the place was full by the time we were half way into our meal, giving a great ambiance to what was initially too quiet a place.I had 12 oz steak(rare) with the roasted potatoes. The steak was PERFECT, as were the potatoes. I am glad that I opted for them, as I have not been eating starches as often as I once did, so I had been reserved. They were worth the indulgence of carbs for sure. \u00a0The Empanadas before the entree were really good, but I would say that the included salad(a few leaves of head lettuce, a few sliced tomatoes, and rings of onion, with oil and vinegar as the only dressing option) that was with the entree was a bit disappointing, though I really did not need more with such a HUGE steak that seemed well over the listed menu weight. It was excellent and the seasonings of the Argentine influence were a nice change from the midwest traditional steak.The lack of a star to make it 5 stars is effected by the fact that veggie choices seem to be the only think lacking at this establishment.I will be back here, hopefully with a date vs a friend next time.

It is not the season for tomatoes. The meal would have been perfect if instead of surprise herb roasted potatoes (they were good), I got a nice salad with my steak. I really wanted steak with a bit of crispy lettuce, couple of onion rings, perhaps a cold boiled potato wedge, white raddish, and a high quality fresh tomato wedge or two with a light red wine vinaigrette.

When my friend suggested this place for dinner, I was pretty psyched. Tango had been on my bookmark list for months. Our wait was almost 2 hours. We expected this and were prepared with some ideas. To rehydrate and kill some time, we went down the street for a drink. In no time, we were seated outside for an enjoyable dinner. Big thumbs up to this BYOB establishment. Our waiter was quick to give us our water and wine glasses for our bottle as soon as we sat down. As busy as it was that night, we had such great service. We had one main waiter, but other guys kept stopping by asking us how we were doing. I think it was because we kept taking a \"breather\" between bites. I regret my attire choice that evening. It's definitely a wear-something-stretchy- kind of place. (Just kidding.)I would skip the bread and butter. I love the stuff but I cannot handle all that and save room for appetizer, salad, and main dish we ordered. We started with the eggplant in a vinegar / garlic sauce. It was a big appetizer and was easily divided up among three people. The sauce was spot on. It was creamy almost like alfredo sauce. I'm not very good at describing but hopefully you get the picture. The salad was a-ok, but at least we got some fresh veggies in with our meal. Next came the bife vesuvio. Holy hell. This was probably one of the best steaks I have eaten, and I don't eat steak often. It's stuffed with spinach and cheese (exact name escapes me) in a white wine sauce. The steak also comes with chimchurri (sp?) sauce, which I think I could have taken that as a shot because it was delicious. We asked for more chimchurri and were given a cup size of the stuff. See? Great service. Since I shared the steak dish, I don't think I would have made a dent with that had I ordered it on my own. Desserts...yes, desserts. As in more than one. As in, we couldn't decide on just one when he brought out a plate full of goodies. We went with the flan and this peaches and cream cake. I think I was in the early stages of a food coma because I can't remember the name of this one. It was made of some sort of yellow cake topped with a whipped cream and peaches filling. It melted in my mouth. The flan was good but really sugary sweet....well, I'm really particular about flan only because I judge every one I've had against my mom's. My mom makes some serious kick-ass leche flan. This one was good, but I've had better. ;-) Good company, good food, and nice weather (minus the humidity) \u00a0makes for a fun dinner night out.

When I get steak, I expect my steak to be the main attraction in terms of taste and seasonings. There was a lot of sauce and sweet potatoes but I think the sweet potatoes sweetened or milled the flavor of the sauce. Overall, not the best thing I've had.

Maybe only the Angelina Jolie kind. As people said, the salad was pretty pathetic if pathetic was a word. Lettuce, sliced tomatoes and onions and vinegar and oil on the side. I was thinking to myself, where's my salad dressing? Oy vey! Empanadas were pretty good, both the meat as well as the spinach and cheese. The sauce went perfectly with them. Ahh, the only redeeming quality in this restaurant. Overall: Not sure if all of their food is like this or was this an off day but I was not impressed. From all the reviews, I was hoping it would blow my socks off but instead it went up like a puff of smoke. I'll come back next time and give it a second chance. Next time, hopefully they'll put some salt on my meat.Btw: It's funny to watch all the drunk people come staggering out!", "Date": "2010-08-12", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Yuly M.", "ReviewID": "S_zi-0_YJx8NZTKFGdJh3w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally went to check this place out last night after hearing about it and reading reviews. \u00a0The food was GREAT! \u00a0Steaks are pretty big and potatoes are good too.

However, before you can get into heaven, you're gonna have to wait more than 2 hours. I will only say this once...GO EARLY. If you have less than 8 people in your party, you cannot make reservations, and the restaurant fills up very quickly. This fact in itself accounts for my mixed review. We arrived at 7:30PM and put our names on the list. After being told that we would have to wait for 2 hours, we walked down the road to Hye Bar for some pre-dinner drinking. Tango Sur is BYOB so I wasn't really bothered by spending money down the street. Once we were finally able to sit down and order, it was about 10PM and we were starving. Now, I don't know if it's because I was wearing over-the-knee black boots, but I seemed to get a lot of attention from the waiters at the restaurant, who are all male. I would also venture to say that 99% of them are from South America, which definitely adds to the authentic feeling of the place! Of course, I didn't mind the attention, and I might have even managed to get a date out of it! Saucy. Speaking of sauce, the first thing we ordered was a plate of empanadas on which we smeared delicious chimichurri sauce. It's a concoction of olive oil, parsley, salt, pepper, garlic, and probably a few other things. But Tango Sur is one of the few places that does not add any vinegar. It was to-die-for! We ordered two spinach and cheese empanadas and two chicken empanadas. They were the perfect appetizer. For the main meal, the hit at the table was the birthday girl's Vacio for two (shown above the empanadas). A grilled steak with sweet potatoes and a tantalizing sauce, it was big and meaty and delicious. I ordered the Bife Vesuvio, a well-done steak stuffed with spinach and cheese, marinated in a white wine sauce. I will say here that it was delicious. But I'm a rare steak kind of girl and I found my meat a little hard to chew. I kept the leftovers, though, so I still enjoyed it! Jessica got the best thing of all, in my opinion: El Filet, filet mignon with a red onion wine sauce. I managed to snag half of hers to take home in my leftovers. It was perfectly cooked and sooooo tender. Although it was annoying to wait until 10PM to sit down and eat, the staff were efficient and fun. They gave us flan with delicious dulce de leche on top for my friend's birthday, and their flirtation added to the sexy ambience. I would for sure go back, but maybe I'd try getting there at 5:30 instead of 7:30. Steaks tend to run about $20-$25 for one person, $35 for a two-person meal. Empanadas are $1.75 each. Run to the restaurant just to try the chimichurri sauce!!!", "Date": "2010-11-22", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Liz X.", "ReviewID": "Fp4IKiilWREjNG8bJYXURA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Once again...over 100 reviews for this place? \u00a0Would normally not review it, but I thought it was so good and rather authentic, that I can't help it. \u00a0I'm sorry to read Erin S's review and her disappointing experience. \u00a0I have recently had a fabulous trip to Argentina and am completely enamored by it. \u00a0And one would think, one would be able to find a fairly authentic Argentine resto in LA. \u00a0Unfortunately, that is not the case. \u00a0Carlito's Gardel comes close, but Tango Sur is so much better! \u00a0OK, Tango Sur is no Cabana Las Lilas in B.A., but TS serves up good quality meat at decent prices AND most of their stuff on the menu is quite authentic for your run-of-the-mill traditional Argentine cuisine. \u00a0So, the steak isn't Chicago Chop House or Cabana Las Lilas quality, but for the price and the atmosphere (which is much more inviting and charming) is top-notch!Admittedly, the proveleta was a bit oily, but was so satisfyingly salty and rich and a perfect way to start of a meal with bread and your BYO-wine. \u00a0Yes, it did take the waiter a bit of time to get over to us and open up the wine, but it's a beautifully lazy Sunday evening with friends...who the eff cares? \u00a0We have to remember that sometimes the American way is not the best or most enjoyable way. \u00a0Dude...and the salads? \u00a0Not even close to romaine. \u00a0I think it was head lettuce, baby! \u00a0And that's what I loved about it. \u00a0This is an establishment of flesh! \u00a0The veggies are there to cut the grease that you either just ingested or are about to ingest. \u00a0This is how they serve up most salads (head lettuce or something akin to it, a few slices of tomato, a few rings of onion and just plain ol' oil and vinegar) at mid-level restos in Europe and (westernized) South America. \u00a0I was actually hoping that I was going to a get a plain ol' salad (in Italy, they usually serve you the salad LAST just to cut the grease) instead of some fancy frouffy salad (don't get me wrong, I love the frouffy salads as well...but at the right time and place). \u00a0We also ordered the eggplant/cheese appetizer which was divine as well. \u00a0My friend and I ordered the lomo special which was basically an obscenely large hunk of lomo (filet) with grilled and marinated portobellos and of course, the chimmichurri. \u00a0We ordered it medium rare (if up to me, it would have been cold in the center) and they did it perfectly. \u00a0Actually, a little more rare than most American medium rares. \u00a0I was happy. \u00a0And dude...I'm a pig, and my friend and I could NOT finish it. \u00a0I can never NOT finish my dinner.

If you know what to order and are willing to follow other rules of thumb when dining at Tango Sur, you're going to have an amazing experience. If not, you're probably going to be miserable!So, since my experiences have been positive and getting better each time I visit, try this:BYO: Don't forget the red wine!GO EARLY: 5pm. 5:15 at the latest especially if it's a weekend. Don't bother with reservations as they seem to get backed up whether you make a reservation or not. I remember at one point being told they only take reservations for large parties.DON'T GO IN A HUGE GROUP: 4 max. 2 is ideal. The huge groups are always waiting and it takes an enormous amount of planning and luck to have your evening at Tango Sur go off without a hitch, so don't bother. They have tons of 2 tops so you have the best chance of a smooth evening as a duo.APPETIZERS: Get a couple of chicken or spinach and cheese empanadas, but you will be plenty full and taking home leftovers so take it easy.STICK WITH WHAT THEY DO BEST: Argentinian Steak. That means the center \u00a0\"Chef's Special\" menu ONLY for entrees. Ignore the domestic beef on the right. Fish and Chicken eaters? Go somewhere else. Seriously. My favorite dish is the Vacio for two. It's a HUGE hunk of \"flap meat\" (i don't know what that is and i don't care) in 2 layers. Between the layers is some nice chimichurri plus more on the side. It's served in a grill with melt in your mouth sweet potato. It's not a steak house steak. It's going to take a moment to accept visually, but just try a bite and let your taste buds show you the way. Get it cooked Medium. Safe and consistent. The Vacio comes with a boring salad. Enjoy if you're hungry, but if you're not, then tread lightly. You have no idea the amount of meat you are about to experience.If this is too many hoops to jump through and you feel that you shouldn't need a secret code to enjoy a restaurant, I hear you and you may be right.

On a nostalgic whim, another BsAs aficionado and I got a group together for some porte\u00f1o cuisine. For starters, I was exceptionally impressed with how quickly we were seated. Score one for eating out on holiday weekends!! Our table of 5 was seated less than half an hour after putting our name in. We were expecting to wait at least an hour or two, so it was a very pleasant surprise.

Our group ordered empanadas to start ($2 each, sold individually so you can get any combo of flavors you like). They were tasty, but very deep fried and much smaller than what I expected for Argentinean empanadas. We also had some fresh-baked bread that was incredible! Because we couldn't stand to wait for the main course to taste a little chimichurri, we asked for some to go with our bread which they brought out in a soup bowl. Holy chimichurri!! It was delicious and ever-so-plentiful. We were also comped salads (perhaps because of ordering in Spanglish? who knows), which was a nice touch. For the main course I had the Bife de Chorizo, which was excellent but a far cry from the quality of beef I'd been dreaming of. Solo en BsAs se puede comer asi.... Diners of eggplant and chicken at our table all seemed very content with their dishes as well. Our waiter was very attentive and fun, playfully alternating between Spanish and English right along with us.

All I heard before this was about how romantic of a place it was. You only go there with a date. Also, we postponed this because if it was going to be too few people, it would look funny, because it's such a romantic place. HOGWASH! I failed to see anything romantic about this place. To get here, we had to drive through a really crummy area of Chicago, and then all of a sudden, this Yuppie-Ville arises (almost a hybrid of Wrigleyville and Lincoln Park). It's not a very spectacular street to look at, it's just surrounded by buidlings, not impressive either. Cars roam by and there's some trash on the street that isn't very appealing either. As we walked in, they asked us if we wanted a seat outside or inside. I looked inside, and it was pitch black, but a few specs of light shone through from an encased candle. As my eyes adjusted, the tables were really close to eachother, outside, at least it was separated from other people's tables. Also, the inside just looked horrible. If you turned on the light, it's like a rundown side shop on Lawrence, but with high ceilings. We chose to sit outside. It was better, but not much better. The street had some litter on it, and it really brought down the atmosphere. There was nothing romantic about it, or even elegant about this place. No different from the bar and grill just next door.Now, the food stuff. The menu, I remember, had a great variety of things to choose from. This place would be a perfect neighborhood restaurant, because there's so many things to try. Any person would be able to enjoy something on this menu. Even their appetizer list had tons of things to enjoy. It would take several visits to this place to really try everything it has to offer.One thing that's kind of cool too is that it's a BYOB place. Presentation was pretty standard. It's the least I expect from any restaurant, clean plate, and slightly garnished. Nothing special there.The food. Argentinian food is really spectacular. It makes use of a lot of herbs, and my favorite, garlic! There were garlic and herbs on every bite. There was no need to wipe your pallete or anything. Every bite was filled to the brim with flavor. Portions were very good. When something on the menu says \"Perfect for 2,\" it means it! Even the single portion meals filled me up; however, you have to take into account that we got appetizers and sides. For a full course meal, it's a perfect buy.Cost was also not an issue, which makes it so great. The appetizers were a bit pricey, but the main courses, the prices were dead on. I couldn't tell you how much I spent, but I certainly didn't mind giving it to them.Service was very standard, the server checked up about the standard number of times, and the amount of service he gave was about standard. His English was a little substandard, and didn't do a great job of explaining a lot of things. He came by and cleaned our plates, and popped our beer bottles, and took them away. There wasn't anything spectacular about the service.Overall, I would come to this place again.

The atmosphere is dark and gloomy, most befitting for a vampire. Illuminated by faint lighting and adorned by dark walls, white candlesticks centered on each table, and a cluster of old photos of Evita, Tango Sur offers up tender, juicy beef dishes in an atmosphere malodorous of death and creepiness. Even as the under-heated empanadas, and later the main course, were served and slowly filling the dining room with culinary aromas, the smell of old blood still lingered in the air. I did enjoy the filet mignon and spinach mashed potatoes, as well as the background Latin music, but everything else was mediocre, including the service, which was certainly nothing to boast about. Despite the fact that I walked out feeling very full, the dining experience at Tango Sur left me feeling emotionally blue and melancholy. Another trip to Chicago will not be met by another trip to Tango Sur. One experience was way too many, I'm afraid.Of note, the white T shirt look worn by the not-so-friendly, pretentious waiters (a seemingly sexist establishment considering there were no women working) is a really cheap look.

This is my first yelp review, and I wish it could be under happier circumstances. My girlfriend and I, having moved to the Southport Corridor area a few months ago, have been excited to try out Tango Sur for a long time, and finally decided to indulge for a nice date Saturday night. I had read reviews and new to expect a long wait. We got there at 8:30, gave our names, and were told it could be up to an hour and half. No problem, we just went to a bar down the street, had a few drinks, stopped at Jewel for a bottle of wine to have with dinner, and then wandered back to Tango Sur at 10:00 to wait to be called.After 10:15 rolled by, my girlfriend decided to ask the host how many people were in front of us, just to get an idea. The host couldn't find our names until he pulled a list out of a cabinet, after which he assured us there were only four tables in front of us. At this point it seemed like we had been forgotten, but it didn't really matter. Like I said we were expecting a decent wait. Maybe ten minutes later we were led back to the waiting room where we could open our bottle of wine while we were on deck for a table.After that point, we watched seven (count em, seven) tables get called. The clock was getting awfully close to 11:00. Finally, we asked the host once again where we were on his list. He pulled out the list, found his spot, and then flipped back through three pages of names to find our name way higher on the list. At this point, we had clearly been forgotten about again, but he assured us we were next. However, merely five minutes later, he comes back into the room, and calls another name. Before he could leave the room, I quickly (yet politely) asked why we weren't next, and he quickly changed the name and said \"oh right, you guys are up.\" Here's where it gets really good. I was slightly frustrated at this point (it was now 11:15, a full two hours and 45 minutes after their 1 1/2 hour TOPS quote) but just kind of wanted to make a point, so I asked him if he had forgotten about us or something. To which he replied \"whatever\" turned around and walked away. Needless to say, both my girlfriend and I were both pretty upset with this treatment. However, after we sat down, we decided to let it go, and enjoy the night, rather than taking it out on our servers (we have both worked at restaurants and know how it goes) over one employee with an attitude. Unfortunately, things kept going downhill. We ordered two empanadas, on recommendation from the waiter, and were brought the entirely wrong selections. At this point, we felt we had to say something, and asked to speak to a manager. Lo and behold, the unruly host approaches our table. I started to explain the situation before I realized in the dim lighting that it was the same person I was complaining about, at which point I asked again to speak to a manager, and here's the biggest thing...he WAS the manager!! I was shocked, and told him so, that a MANAGER at a reputable place like Tango Sur, could look at a guest, after skipping him and forgetting him for over two and half hours (which he admitted to) and say \"Whatever,\" and walk away (which he also admitted to doing). He apologized once or twice, and then just started to walk away, nothing done! I had to call him back to ask if he was going to do anything to fix it, at which point he told us he \"guessed he could get us some complimentary desserts after the meal.\" Fine. We just wanted to have a nice date, so we said OK, and ate our meal (which was delicious, but besides the point). Finally, the waiter came to clear our plates and we told him the manager had said we could enjoy some complimentary desserts. The waiter said OK, but instead of returning with a menu, came back with one piece of flan. And our bill. Regardless of the fact that my girlfriend doesn't even like flan, I think this is well beyond an unacceptable way to make up for the MANAGER of a restaurant treating us like that (a dessert each of our own choice would have been the BARE MINIMUM, in my eyes). Knowing I wouldn't get any farther with that manager, we left, angry and disappointed. I have been trying to get in touch with a general manager or owner since then in order to better resolve this, and my phone calls and e-mails have all gone unanswered. I will keep trying to contact someone in hopes that this will be made right, as the food was delicious and I am dying to love this restaurant, but right now my blood boils every time I think of the place.", "Date": "2011-10-25", "Author_Location": "Lakeview, Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Brette R.", "ReviewID": "SRlVDDQdk7LHCk09Mo1hLQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The steak here is unbelievable!

I've had better salads everywhere else I've ever eaten.The two tables that had come in 10 and 15 minutes after us (respectively) had already been served and were making good progress on whatever hunk o' meat that was in front of them. Finally, I looked at my watch and figured out that we had already been there for over an hour, and we still hadn't gotten our entree. I flagged down a wary-looking guy who was having trouble opening bottles of wine the next table over and asked him what was up. He fetched our server (there HAS to be a black hole inside the restaurant somewhere) and the server came out, all defensive, saying that HE didn't make a mistake; the dish WE ORDERED has a 35-minute cook time. A 35-minute cook time? For a 16-oz steak, cooked med-rare? OOOkay... Then he proceeds to tell us that that was why he asked us if we wanted an appetizer, because that dish takes so long to cook. Um, he brought out our appetizer before he even took our entree order! So I call bullshit. Twenty minutes later, we had our dish; an unappetizing hunk of steaming beef set in an oily sauce with a bullet of admittedly good chimichurri on the side. And it was cooked to approaching shoe leather on the outside, and on the inside it was well-done. Nowhere near med-rare. At that point, I was more focused on just getting the fugg outta there...and it was nearly 8:00. I wanted the last 2.5 hours of my life back. I felt like they should have paid me.I really disliked this place. The wait and inattention to service was so distracting. Good thing was, our bill only came out to a little over $50. I thought $4 and the change was reflective of the service, and, as a former waitress, I usually tip anywhere between 15-25%. Everything about this place was bad, from the uninspired menu to the lackadaisical service. Just awful, really. Had the food been outstanding, I can tell you there would be at least 2 or 3 more stars up there, but really? Nothing special. Greasy, oily...just not the right stuff. I would recommend not going here. Consider El Nandu on Fullerton instead; much better service, better-tasting food, and you won't be in a hurry to just leave and be anywhere else but there.

Well, these things happen, right? I didn't have time to wait around, but on Tuesday I made sure that I called and told them I was going to be there in 45 minutes to pick up the card, and wanted to make sure the manager would be there. \"Oh sure.

He had just stepped out for 35-45 minutes.Now normally, this wouldn't be a huge deal for me, but both times I was left standing in the sun, outside for 10-15 minutes while some guy disappears inside.

I knew in advance that I wanted to go out, so I had him wear a nice shirt and pants to work. Then I got all gussied up myself so that we could go to Tango Sur. We were of course prepared for a wait as it was Friday night and having been there before/read many reviews, we knew what was coming. The problem was that when we got there, there weren't many people. We put our names down and were told 40 minutes to an hour. 40 minutes go by and still nothing. We go to the waiting area in the back which has zilch to do other than talk to the person you came with, which you can do just as easily outside. They don't seem to be too organized, so I insisted we go back outside so that they would actually see us. My bf spoke with the host not once, not twice, but THREE times and each of these times, the host had no clue who he was (I feel knowing your customer is part of being a good host and have never encountered that before). When we left the waiting room to go back outside, he thanked us for coming. We had to explain we hadn't even eaten yet, just moved back outside. While we were going back through the restaurant on our way outside, we noticed several large tables (by large tables I just mean lots of 2 person tables pushed together) being freed up. We thought we would soon be seated, but no. Rather than do what is right and separate the big tables for those couples who have been waiting a long time (there were 4 or 5 couples waiting just as long as we were), they chose to seat the groups of 6+ who arrived 30+ minutes after we did and put their names in. Not cool. After about an hour and 15 minutes, we left. We were super hungry at that point and I was getting crankier and crankier. We chose to go to Azha, another BYOB place (for we purchased wine to drink at Tango Sur) not too far away. They FINALLY called us to tell us our table was ready nearly 2 hours \u00a0after we arrived. It really made me angry that they so poorly underestimated how much time we'd be waiting. Frankly, we could've seen a movie at the Music Box down the street in the time that we were waiting for a table. It very much irked me that people who arrived later were given seats before us simply because they had more people and big tables were available first. It would be good business practice in that case to separate a freed up big table for the couples who've been waiting a long time. Needless to say, we were both completely disappointed. We took a chance with the Friday night (because they stupidly-in my opinion- still don't take reservations) and were fine with waiting 40 mins to an hour. No biggie. But the gross underestimation of time we actually had to wait was completely ridiculous. When they finally did call, we were already enjoying our appetizers at Azha. Maybe someday we'll go back, but never on a Friday night (or weekend night) again and not while we're actually pretty hungry.

We both had two entire steaks on our plates, and we certainly could have shared one entree and been plenty full. Not that I am complaining about having filet mingon again today for lunch.

I am understanding. 9:00 Ask again, how much longer. Host \"I don't have your name in my book anymore, so the other guys have it. Very soon, very soon.\" We have seen the \"other guys\" call people, but strangely, they seem to get the numbers straight from the head host. Hmmm...9:15 It's 60 in July, and we have discovered that there is a waiting area inside, we must look miserable because we have been told \"You're the next table.... inside.\"Us: \"Could we just wait inside then in the waiting area (that is empty we have discovered)?\"Host: \" Someone will have to escort you in, we can't just let people inside.\" Really?

Host: \"2 for inside?\"Us: \"No, 4, but we've been waiting almost 3 hours, we will sit anywhere. They just went to get wine.\" The host turns and practically runs away. Did we have a table or not? It seems that everyone else is getting one!9:55 A group that has just arrived since the last is pulled to be sat. Desperately, I ask the last guy out of the room (they have a small party). \"Excuse me, how long have you been waiting?\"Guy: \" Do you REALLY want to know? (Nodding yes.) 5 minutes... but we had a reservation.\"Us: \"Really, for 3?\" (They don't take reservations... read the other reviews.) Guy \"Yeah... how long have YOU been waiting.\"Us: 3 hours...\"Guy: \"What!?! 3 HOURS? Hold on...\"The guy walks away, one minute later, he comes back and says,\" That table is yours, right there.\"Us: \"What?\" (Completely dumbfounded.)Guy: \"Yeah, right there.\" He points and sure enough a table is being frantically set and \u00a0in the background, the host who so rudely walked away from us earlier is snapping his fingers at us from across the room (so RUDE!) and pointing to the table.3 HOURS WAITING... Magically seated by a guy who got a reservation for 3 on a Saturday night at a place that doesn't take them? If not for this guy, who knows if we would have waited longer. WE have HIM to thank, whoever he is was. Does he work there? Is he related to someone who does? \u00a0Who knows, but HE was the reason we got our table. Why did you wait that long? \u00a0That's stupid. Agreed, but the promising \"you're next\" and \"very soon\" comments kept us waiting. If I had been given an honest time in the beginning or if there was a system that didn't just seat those from Argentina or other hispanohablantes (there were many groups) first maybe it would not have been so long, maybe we would have gone elsewhere, but now I will never return.The food is amazing and the only thing positive in the night, if you go, go early on a weeknight, then you will not have to deal with that DISASTER of a rude and unorganized hosting staff.

One thing we discussed was going to a dinner somewhere that might be worthy of a review. Without hesitation he picked Tango Sur. I have experienced American steakhouses where dark wood and dim lights create ambiance for big steaks; and Brazilian steakhouses where meats (on swords!) are brought to the table in waves; and Japanese steakhouses where I get cranky if my Teppen chef does not transition the onion volcano into a choo-choo train. Tango Sur was my first Argentinian steakhouse. No gimmicks, just good food.We started with what my friend told me was basically an appetizer ritual when he goes to Tango Sur: Spinach & Cheese Empanadas. Not to detract from the rest of the meal, details still forthcoming below, but the empanadas we heavenly. The entire meal was delicious, but the appetizers stole the show. Luckily we ordered the appetizers and our entrees at once, so I did get something else to write about. I had the Bife Vesuvio - steak stuffed with spinach, cheese and garlic. It may seem slightly redundant to get something stuffed with spinach and cheese after the empanada, but I was tantalized by the garlic (I believe it was the only item on the menu that specifically listed garlic. What was a guy to do?). Ultimately it was the right order; it was delicious. The steak, actually, was fine. I feel like it was a hunk of flank steak or something similar -- tough and plain. It was seasoned perfectly so that I almost forgot how dangerously close it came to being dry. The stuffing was out of this world. I feel like garlic and cheese on anything is almost cheating, but I won't complain. I loved it. We both ate an incredible amount of food, but it is hard to pass on dessert so we decided to split a slice of carrot cake. Even the dessert was great. It was slightly more dense than what I consider a traditional carrot cake, which was right up my alley. We bought wine from the over-priced wine store across the street from the restaurant. Tango Sur is b.y.o.b. and they charged (I believe) no corking fee. As a practical matter, the over-priced wine from the store was still less expensive than it would have been off a restaurant menu, so take that into consideration if you go to the same store. This was a great restaurant and without his suggestion, I never would have found it on my own.

I went for a friend's birthday party here and we had a reservation, but were told the table wasn't quite ready yet. No problem, they have a waiting room of sorts with tables and benches where we sat and broke into our wine. Good thing we had all brought a bottle because we ended up getting sat an hour after our reservation time. Normally we would have been pissed and stormed out, but since we had a place to sit and chat and drink, we were more than fine. And the hostess was very nice about it, plus they sent over 2 appetizers on the house for our party of ten when we did get seated. We ended up ordering the exact same appetizers so that there was enough for everyone as well. We got the cheese which was pretty good (it's just melted cheese, people, but I do love it) and the eggplant dish which was super delicious. One of our diners HATES eggplant and didn't even know that she was eating it, plus complimented how great it tasted. We also got the empandas which were fabulous as well. Then, onto the entrees. Everyone seemed really pleased with their dishes (this may be biased due to the hour of drinking beforehand, but who cares). I ordered the steak that was stuffed with garlic and other herbs and had sweet potatoes. Thank God I decided to split it with someone as suggested. The thing was HUGE. And tasty. \u00a0The girls next to me split the other 'ideal for two' plate, and there's just looked like a giant piece of meat, but was no less tasty. Finally we ordered desserts to share: flan, german chocolate cake, and something else (i'm not sure as it was so good it never made it around to me before being devoured). It was an amazing meal and when our bill came I was shocked: 10 people ate and 9 paid (not the bday girl of course) and our total was 32 bucks including tax and tip. THIRTY-TWO BUCKS! And almost everyone had huge portions as leftovers, except maybe the girls who ordered the talapia. It was amazing.Now, there are a few things that I have to share just so that no one is surprised by them: yes, it is very dark (I had trouble reading the menu but again it could have been all that wine before food), yes, it is VERY noisy (I could barely talk to anyone other than the people directly next to me), and yes, it gets very crowded (one of our party noticed a sign that said it was voted 'most romantic restaurant' one year and it caused us all to scratch our heads), but the service and food is so good, that it more than outweighs these.

It is BYOB with NO corking fees so this contributed to an even better experience than I expected. As for the quality of the food, my friend ordered this appetizer that I fell in love with. It was some sort of queso fundido which was creamy, gooey, and bad on so many levels but oh so good. The warm bread and butter they served at first wasn't far behind the quality of the queso. For dinner I ordered a filet mignon which was complimented by some rather large potatoes that resembled steak fries and to my surprise, there were TWO medallions of steak on the plate. Needless to say I had to take one home. On another note, at times it got a little noisy but this was mainly due to the tacky singing of the birthday celebration behind us. For a second I thought I was at the Olive Garden. Also, bring a flash light with you so that you can see the menu because it is a romantically dark atmosphere and only a few candles shed light.

We arrived at about 7:30 pm and were immediately seated (a Wednesday night) at one of the last two tables that were open. Tall lit candles established a romantic atmosphere, but the main room (i.e. where you enter) was quite noisy. \u00a0Fortunately, the second, larger room was a bit quieter, but the sound level was still quite high. The sounds of merriment. \u00a0The decor and atmosphere is very convincingly equivalent to restaurants in Buenos Aires. \u00a0Once I tasted the Malbec, I was transported 5,000 miles to Buenos Aires, where restaurants like this are ubiquitous. \u00a0Of course, the prices printed on the menus there are almost the same, but they are in Argentine pesos, so the cost is at least third less (i.e. $1 USD = $3.7 pesos).In addition to being seating immediately, our waiter was at our table almost instantly with bread and butter and to open our wine. \u00a0We were impressed. \u00a0The place is crawling with wait staff. \u00a0Okay, let's get to assigning STARS:Ambiance: \u00a0As I said earlier, visually, the ambiance is totally Buenos Aires. \u00a0Whoever put this place together is a Porte\u00f1o or has spent some serious time in BA. Although I give Tango Sur a point for ambiance, there were a couple of disappointments. First, the music could barely be heard over the ambient crowd noise. \u00a0The only thing we could hear, seated by the window, was the bass line, which is annoying. \u00a0Lousy speakers and not enough of them; what else can I say. However, the music was good and what we hear in Buenos Aires. I almost want to give them a point for that! \u00a0Second, the bread is served with little plastic packets of butter, rather than actual pats of butter. That's simply inelegant, for a restaurant of this caliber. Too bad. Third, and this is unfortunate, when they cleared the appetizer plates, they took the knife (good), but left my dirty fork (bad). \u00a0It was deposited exactly were I would naturally lean with my elbow. \u00a0A fresh fork is in order.Food: \u00a0The beef empanadas were good. \u00a0The papas espanola so-so. For an entree we shared the Lomo Relleno, which is a \"half slab argentine filet sliced and filled with a chimichurri, ham sauce then cooked and served on a grill with portabella marsala.\" \u00a0($36, serves 2). \u00a0The piece of meat was enormous; enough, in my opinion, for four, or there is no ordering desert. The gravy was simply divine. I mean absolutely divine. \u00a0The lomo (i.e. beef tenderloin), shockingly, was awful; the worst piece of beef tenderloin I have ever had in my life. C was in complete agreement. \u00a0It was stringy like you can't believe. \u00a0I literally could not chew 50% of what I put in my mouth. \u00a0When the waiter stopped to ask how we were enjoying our beef, we told him the truth. He looked stunned.

Meat lovers, here is your destined haven. \u00a0I love steak, and for those avid steak worshipers, best believe that good steak that is cooked to perfection is hard to come across.

Not here! They did as I said, and my $36 steak that they recommended splitting with my boyfriend was just the perfect size for two people with huge appetites. \u00a0The small portion of pesto sauce most definitely completed the taste. For appetizers, I was not disappointed one bit; \u00a0the empanadas surely exceeded my expectations. I've only had the chance to try the beef ones, but so far so good. Dessert was delightful.

But my companion was adamant that we try , so we bought a bottle of nice champagne and off we optimistically tromped. As luck would have it, we were able to walk right in. Now let me first say my friend and dinner companion, has been to Argentina several times and the restaurant interior caused a jones to go back. there.. dimly lit with candles, everyone looked fabulous - completed the Argentina romance theme along with some fabulous music. The service was competent and handsome (always a good thing in my book) our bottle of champagne was opened and poured in blink of an eye , menus dispensed, suggestions made - we were well on our way to a lovely experience. The server suggested that we split the tenderloin - we agreed. First we received a totally uninspired green salad with a tomato and a few onion slices and a vinegar and oil dressing, b. o. r. i. n.g. Then we were served up the most enormous hunk of sizzling hot beef flesh I have ever seen. It was perfectly cooked and we just had to saw off the hunks we wanted. here is my problem, bad chimichurri sauce, favor-less and oily was unable to cut through the well, \"meatiness\" of the hunk o meat. Worse, by this time it was so dark in our little corner of the restaurant - I couldn't tell whether I was eating a piece of mushroom or a piece of meat until it was in my mouth. Color me old lady fussy - but I found this disconcerting. Now I was thrilled with the price - which was low for the quality of meat alone.

Our server was friendly, attentive, and more than will to recommend, and cater to my allergy. I find that many servers become irritated at my allergy, which is ridiculous, because I'm am NOT a fussy eater. \u00a0My friends started with the antipasto, which was nothing special. \u00a0It was good, but neither the presentation nor the quality was to write home about. \u00a0I was torn between two allergy acceptable items, and our server helped me choose lengua a la vinagreta. \u00a0The beef tongue was braised nicely, and the texture and flavor of the tongue was to die for. \u00a0I have never been served cold tongue, and it's something I will try again. \u00a0My friends who were resident in trying it- LOVED IT. Prior to dinner, we all received a complimentary salad- plain, but I can't complain, it was free. Now to my main Chef's specials entree- costeleta which is a bone in rib-eye, which is then grilled, topped with olive oil, \u00a0and a garlic and parsley sauce, served with mashed potatoes. \u00a0Due to my allergy, they kindly substituted the potatoes with a allergy friendly potato side. \u00a0When my food arrived, my server was kind (this doesn't happen very often) and reassured that my entire entree was dairy-free, which includes butter. \u00a0He went one step further, and told me all the ingredients, and prep. \u00a0I shouldn't be worried when dining out, but too many times I do worry about my allergy. The best part of the meal was how the steak was seasoned and cooked. \u00a0It was a perfect mid-rare throughout, the cut was great, and it was seasoned absolutely perfectly. \u00a0I usually either want to, or go ahead and have my steaks returned to the kitchen, however this one was perfect :) \u00a0I'm very grateful of this, since I don't eat much red meat, this is a bi-monthly occurrence, so it was nice that it will be memorable. Oh, onto the BEST part. It's BYOB, and corking services are FREE!!! The servers were always attentive of the bottles, either opening the next bottle in line at your table, or filling your glasses. \u00a0From what I could see, everyone around us also had great service.

While you wait, I would recommend stopping in and grabbing a drink at Cullen's, this Irish pub a few doors down.One thing you should note about Tango Sur: it's cramped and very noisy inside. Not the type of place to take your grandma who wraps herself in a cardigan and complains about the cold draft when the hostess seats her by the door. If you want to have a conversation, I would recommend sitting outside. Now for the food. The steaks are good-sized, taste great and are extremely well-priced. When you're finished eating one you'll sit back and wonder how the Hell those places in the Loop get away with charging 40 bucks. In my experience with Tango Sur, I've only had one problem: \u00a0my girlfriend ordered the spinach ravioli (she's vegetarian) and after eating a couple pieces, she realized they messed up her order and gave her the meat ravioli. She immediately lost her appetite and stopped eating.Now to most people, this might be hard to understand, but she was raised vegetarian and mistakingly eating meat causes her to not be hungry anymore. Fine. We politely notify our waiter that she is vegetarian and that he gave her the wrong dish. But instead of apologizing or offering to get her something else, he denies it! We literally had to open up a piece of ravioli and show it to him. Dude, we're not trying to scam you out of two pieces of 12 dollar ravioli.

I have frequented this place enough, to know the Vasio is very good plate, for a dinner for two. The meal is great and comes with Sweet Potatoes on the sides. In many instances am pretty certain you will not eat all the food provided as its so plentiful. The best time to visit this place is during the spring and summer nights when you can sit outdoors, the inside is very cozy and quaint, but also very, very noisy. You can go there with your significant other for a cozy dinner, but be aware, it's very loud, and tables are close to each other so, be prepare to share your intimate moment with your table neighbors. Best recommendations is to go there with a group of friends, have everyone bring a bottle of wine (BYOB) order different entrees, and appetizer the table can share, and also at the end pick the different desert to allow everyone to try something, the price is reasonable and wont break the bank. Once you have a meal at Tango Sur, be prepare to go back home, get on the couch and veg. Several times I've attempted to eat at Tango Sur and go down to the Bars on Southport and have been unsuccessful, as I am too full from dinner to go anywhere but home. Things to try: The cheese & spinach empanada, their side salad to me is always lacking and I rarely eat. The Deserter Options are very decadent and Rich. Things to know: Be prepared to wait for at least 45-60 minutes, during Friday-Sunday in the winter, and summer nights anytime past 6 PM prepare for a long wait. The cost is very reasonable, as you get more than what you pay for. Best Recommendation, go there put your name on the list give your cell number, walk down to the Jewel to get your wine, or stop by a local bar, and have a cocktail as you wait.", "Date": "2009-01-15", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Dan H.", "ReviewID": "XSxdMs3yS6eOw4g3WQKtzA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think this place is great!

BONE, range grown veal t. bone cooked on the grill,served with mashed potatoes and red chimichurri. We tried both and could not stop smiling at each other. Both were perfectly cooked and totally satisfying. Our waiter (Ever Rios) was always smiling and asked every few minutes if we needed anything, which is always nice, very attentive and friendly.A total thumbs up and will return monthly!Not only is the place affordable and serve amazing, unbelievable, good food, but also it's a BYOB.

interesting and functional presentation of meat dishes involving small grills+ no corkage fee- quality of meat itself is average at best- no reservations- often noisymy experiences there have led me to realize that their mode of operation is to take meat cuts of generally very ordinary caliber and deliberately overseason them, *perhaps* in the name of authenticity. \u00a0this is no greasy spoon steak, however neither is it one from peter luger's. \u00a0my dish during the most recent trip was the vacio, which is typically a tougher cut of meat (flank steak), whose flesh is beneath a couple layers of fat and nerve tissue. \u00a0these layers help moisten the flesh during grilling and provide, generally speaking, an impressive crust to the meat. \u00a0it can be quite delightful if only seasoned with salt, or perhaps pepper and a bit of ash (!). \u00a0what ended up happening at tango sur was a very, very strong melange of chimichurri, garlic, accompanied with a hint of flesh from the vacio itself. \u00a0you can scrape the overcoat and stuffing off the meat and end up with a considerable pile of overpowering flavor on the side of your plate--and then you're left with an unfortunately tough cut of meat with unusually bold seasoning. \u00a0the portion was big enough for three--reasonably priced to feed two people, but i'd rather spend a little less on something that

OK... \u00a0I went back out and waited with another gentleman that seemed to also be waiting. \u00a0The man from the restaurant came out. \u00a0The gentleman asked for a table for 7 at which time the man from the restaurant informed him that it would be at least an hour and that he should have called since they make reservations for parties 6+. \u00a0I then asked about the wait for a party of 2. He told me it would be at least an hour and that he could take my number down and give me a call when something opened up. \u00a0I stepped away to call my bf to pick me up since the wait was so long while 2 girls came up and asked for a table. \u00a0The man said 20 minutes. 20 minutes!? I went back up to him and asked why the wait was all of a sudden so much shorter and he said they had called ahead and made reservations. \u00a0(Even though he had just said they only take reservations for parties of 6+.) I shared with him that I tried calling several times and couldn't get through. \u00a0He then said I was a LIAR and asked me to TAKE OUT MY PHONE, SHOW HIM MY CALL LOG and PROVE to him that I tried calling. \u00a0WT??!?! \u00a0It was completely unprofessional and uncalled for. \u00a0I'm absolutely disgusted with how I was treated and will not attempt to eat at this restaurant ever again.", "Date": "2011-12-20", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Ian S.", "ReviewID": "-0op8JhInYHjGuKS3XDY4w", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My girlfriend loves this place and most people do.

We arrived at Tango Sur at our reservation time and the owner/host faltered between two very different stories about why he didn't have a reservation noted for us... 1st, he said that we were supposed to confirm the reservation hours before our arrival and apparently we didn't so... no table (ok, that's fine if a restaurant wants to have this type of policy - but no one told my friend to do so when she made the original reservation).... and 2nd, he told us that the restaurant had tried calling my friend this AM to confirm, but she didn't answer (umm, ZERO missed calls on my friend's phone from today). OK, make up your mind and pick a story! Aside from the owner/host's fabricated stories.... he had an AWFUL attitude and was not very friendly. Since Tango Sur told us we would have to wait at least another hour to be seated, we moved down the street and found another fabulous BYOB that would accommodate our group of 7.... I highly recommend saving your time at Tango Sur. Go to Frida instead!!! It is BYOB and Mexican food... yummy. Plus, the host and wait staff were super nice/accommodating.

If you pay $15 or $20 per head and you save a bunch of money by bring your own liquors perhaps you cannot expect the decor, service, and food of a five-star restaurant. I am not saying that any of them sucks, they are good, not spectacular. What makes Chicago special for lower income groups (like us students) is restaurant like Tango Sur that offer value, affordability, and a memorable evening. Southport is an interesting neighborhood and Musicbox is right around the corner, but parking is a bit tricky at times.

This Sunday we were there with a party of 7, seated inside. We had a reservation, or we thought we did, but when we got there they said they could not find the reservation. Just because we were lucky, another party was leaving at that time, so they were able to seat us. We brought our wines, and were enjoying the appetizers(I personally like the eggplant one), then I felt something crawling on my hand... When I looked down on my napkin, I saw a 3 inch black round cockroach type of bug on top of it, which was really unexpected. I like outdoors and camping etc, so I am used to bugs, but this is my first encounter within a restaurant. In order not to freak out the ladies on the table, I wrapped the thing with the napkin, and took it to the manager type outside(he's the one with the pony tail). Told him what happened, and went back to my table. On his way back, arrogant son of a gun(aka. the manager type pony tailed guy) stopped by at our table, and without even apologizing, said something like, \"Oh this is the summer time, door's open, these small bugs come in, there is nothing we can do about it, etc.\", which really pissed me off. 1- it's was not small by any means 2- he did NOT assume responsibility for something he should be controlling 3- I am pretty sure that leaving the door open for a restaurant, which is his argument, is not allowed exactly because of this within the health code.Therefore, even though I like their food a lot, I wont be able to go back there for quite some time, simply because of the way they handled this situation.

The seasoning was good but just a tad bit salty for my taste. It didn't stop me from enjoying my meal though.....believe me. My friend's filet was cooked to perfection and by that I mean it had the right amount of redness (Medium Well) not to mention it was so juicy and it just melted in my mouth when he let me try a piece. I finally had to stop eating my dinner because there was no way I would leave without trying a dessert. I loved the little tray the server brought around to help us decide what dessert to get. I ended up getting the a light cake with peaches and my friend got cheesecake.....They were both superb and I'm glad I saved room for \u00a0them.

First time was for a bachelor party the second was with a bunch of couples the third was for another bachelor party and this fourth time was the most fun. Anyway getting a reservation was as usual with the very blunt receptionist. But after deciding on a date based on everyones availability we got there and ended up waiting 25mins past our reservation time because the restaurant was behind schedule. Well it kinda worked out because 2 of our friends were running kind of late and the friends we came with took a while to find parking. The hosts treat the guests like were at a night club. Unless you have a reservation you are not allowed in the waiting room. Which kind of sucked because it was cold out and we had to wait about 15mins in the cold. But anyways we got in and only waited another 5mins until we were sat down. Everything after that was a pleasant experience. Everytime I go I order the Bife Ancho. That's the boneless rib eye. 3 out of 4 times I was in bovine heaven! Only once was the meat a little tough. This time it was simply divine. I'm not a bragger by nature but I thought my steak was the best choice out of everyone elses. Yes filet mignon is great for those that love tender lean meat but if you want a super juicy cut with tenderness while it's still mooing, order the Bife Ancho medium rare. Although I prefer baked empanadas my wifes ham and cheese empanadas were good. The bread they bring out also freshly baked. We also shared dessert with everyone. The flan was good except for the caramel being way too sweet. I should've had an espresso with it to balance the flavors. Overall it was a lovely evening.

I think they need to do some research about what exactly a reservation entails(Que Seinfeld music). Secondly your greeted in a bullying manner almost as soon as you enter. This guy must be the owner cause he really has a pair, giving you 5 inches of space once you walk in. I wasn't even sure he worked there (tall and thin snob of a man with no smile)? I was then escorted to the back waiting area. Hmm okay I will play along. 20 min later we asked this RTard \u00a0when our table might be ready? He responded \"when a table is ready it will be ready or you can leave\" after I picked up my jaw from the floor (what a colossal D-Bag) we decided to stay. I figured it can't be much worse after we get passed this guy. So we are seated and the service is now very noticeably better though the waiter was in such a rush he left the table only taking one appetizer order.(stomach growling by now) When he came back in about 5 min. we were able to add to the appetizers which were eh so so, the sauce really made the empanadas. I ordered the steak in the wine sauce. MMMM! but I have had better at Las Tablas. In all it was like an awkward conversation with a girl who has been told shes super hot but she really is more like a 5 and she thinks her Sh&t doesn't stink. I give it a two star rating because of the price of the food and the better options in the neighborhood when you consider everything, but the food Was nice don't get me wrong.

Give me a break, had to walk 5 blocks uphill both ways to get to this dump. Let's see, what else does this \"restaurant\" have not to offer? Oh, not to mention the fact that they pack diners in so tight there's barely room to blow a fart.

When I say outstanding I mean one of the top three experiences in Chicago. Attentive, knowledgeable, helpful, funny and organic. The food matched the service. We ordered three empanadas to start, beef, chicken and ham & cheese. All amazing flavor as well as they come with a a garlic, oil dipping sauce. They also give you bread and butter. For dinner we both ordered el filet. This is a filet with spinach mashed potatoes, a red wine sauce and two separate filets ( in addition to a dinner salad, nothing special but greens, tomatoes and onions). After eating the empanadas, we each had a filet and mp leftover so we probably could have shared a plate, but what's the fun in that? For dessert we ordered the caramel cheesecake..... Wow.

The atmosphere is great - dim lighting, candles on the tables, etc. It is quite loud, however - so not exactly romantic, but definitely an intimate spot for a group of friends! The food --- we started with the provoleta (awesome) and a sampling of each type of empanada - I enjoyed the spinach and cheese ones, but not sure if I'd order them again. The boyfriend and I split the el filet, which is TWO filets in a wine/onion sauce with a side of spinach mashed potatoes. My steak was great - cooked perfectly, not fatty. The mashed potatoes are average at best. The best part, though - was asking for a side of chimichurri sauce on the side for dipping the steak. The chimichurri is out of this world! Just be prepared to smell like garlic :) For dessert, we had a rolled pound cake topped with the most delicious whipped caramel I've ever had. And the best part - we walk out of there for $25/person!
