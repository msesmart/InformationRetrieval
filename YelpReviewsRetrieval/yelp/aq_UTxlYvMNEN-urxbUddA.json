It was a little pricey but well worth it.-The Vegan Benedict is so flavorful and probably one of the most unique and tasty vegan dishes I've tried in awhile. A little salty. -Fresh vegetable salad is basically a bunch of random raw veggies chopped up without mixed greens. I enjoyed because it tastes like stuff I put together at home, but it's not exactly what you'd expect when ordering a salad at a restaurant.-Blueberry ricotta pancakes are off the hook delicious!! Could use more blueberries in them, but this is the best pancake I've ever had. Crispy edges but fluffy and soft. 2 HUGE pancakes per order.Service was very attentive and went smooth.

But I'd never thought to use BLD and \"dinner\" in the same sentence. That is, not until yesterday, when a friend had organized a small group of us to try BLD for DineLA. It seems I'm not the only person who associates BLD exclusively with weekend breakfasts, as BLD was virtually empty on this first night of DineLA. I think there were only three tables occupied in the vast dining room, and ours was one of them. So, longtime readers will know that I'm a DineLA scrooge. While some LA restaurants actually do offer up significant value in their special menus, many of them skimp on quality and portion sizes to trick you into thinking you're getting a deal. (Plus, adding on a dessert course isn't really a \"deal\" if you wouldn't order it otherwise). So I walked into BLD prepared to be disappointed. So prepared, in fact, that I was ultimately too skeptical to order off the DineLA menu. I just ordered the standard $18 lamb burger, which was too highly seasoned and honestly, pretty \"blah\" (an assessment seconded by the other two friends at my table who ordered it). Ironically, friends who chose the DineLA menu fared better. All of the starters, often so tiny and perfunctory during DineLA, were actually quite impressively-portioned and delicious. The tomato salad prepared three ways - raw, pickled and \"fried\" (green) - was quite a large and hearty dish. My companion to my left also enjoyed the prosciutto and fig fritters, and another friend liked his lobster roll (which I had mistakenly assumed was a sushi roll, but was actually a Maine-style lobster sandwich). The main courses were mostly a hit as well. One friend adored her branzino in an intensely-flavored olive sauce. The pickiest friend didn't much like her lobster mushroom pasta, but I tried a bite of the (huge!) mushroom, and it was well flavored and tender. The duck ravioli looked yummy, though I didn't try it.As for dessert: Typically, DineLA dessert offerings are simpler, smaller portioned and less artfully presented than their regular menu counterparts (due to the mass quantities in which they have to be made). BLD's desserts on this evening were no exception. While my friends enjoyed the simply-presented \"Lemon Ripple Ice Cream Pie\" and \"Guiness Doughnuts,\" the friend who ordered the banana cream pie from the regular menu was much more satisfied (and the rest of us were envious). The pie serving was literally twice the size of the DineLA dessert portions, and with its mounds of curliqued whipped cream and precisely-placed banana slices, it had clearly been assembled and prepared with a lot more finesse and care.While my sandwich had not been amazing, my friends' enjoyable DineLA experiences make me want to come back next time to see what all the fuss was about.", "Date": "2014-07-15", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Vencci H.", "ReviewID": "CliohsXDH4-uSjsCOF55_g", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came here for brunch, thought my experience was nothing incomparable to other brunch places.

For it's price, I would say it is fair however I would not come back specifically for anything unless I was in the area. The pancakes were pretty good, could taste the ricotta and the braised pork poached eggs were decent but lacked some taste.

I came on a Saturday at peak brunch hour and was surprised to be seated right away. No such luck on a Sunday, though. I'll just come right out and say it: The blueberry ricotta pancakes should be a sin. They're incredible. They come out in huge portions so it's a great dish to share among the table. The first time I came, I also got the \"Eggs As You Like Them\" with fingerling potatoes, chicken sausage, and multi-grain bread. They were good, not great. My friend got the cuban pork sandwich, which turned out to be a much better choice. The second time I came, I got the turkey sausage scramble with pain de mie and french fries. I will DEFINITELY get the same thing next time I go. What a delectable combination. The service at my second visit was a disaster. My friend and I each ordered a dish plus some pancakes to split. Our food came literally 5 minutes later which was suspiciously awesome, save for the fact that they gave me an incorrect side dish. They ended up bringing my correct dish 10 minutes later to the incorrect table (one down from us). I had to chase the waiter down to tell him the dish was mine when the incorrect table informed him it was not their order. We later find out that the food we received so quickly was actually meant for the table they'd tried to give my side dish to. (They just happened to have very similar orders to my friend and me.) So they had to wait double the time for their orders, as my friend and I obviously dove right into our meals the second they were served. I tried to feel immense sympathy for them between bites of the incredible scramble.On top of all that, the pancakes came out when we were already done with our meals and full, which was a bummer. My friend also ordered a french-press coffee, but they ran out of french presses (how does that happen?) and my friend had to wait about 20 minutes for her coffee.I think the service was just a fluke that time (maybe the waiters were new?), and it certainly won't prevent me from going back.", "Date": "2014-07-13", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Sharon H.", "ReviewID": "Qpae4g8ro4SaCa3j9CzvZw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love coming here for brunch.

Usually I scrambles bore me since I feel like I can make them myself at home, but the flavor combinations in some of their scrambles can't be beat. great side potato options too.

Brunch is still great and always packed on weekends, but the dinner business has been cratering and it's surprising that management hasn't addressed it. BLD has one of the best dinners around in its \"self-constructed dinner\" option. Their roasted chicken is superb. The charcuterie plates, burgers, fresh vegetable salad, and many of their other dishes are always excellent. The steamed mussels, a fairly recent menu addition, are some of the best I've had outside of France. The food is not the problem. It's everything else. As business has fallen off they've cut back on staff so service, while still warm and friendly, is now also scattered and slow. The bartender is neither good nor fast so drinks take a long time in coming and when they do they do they are mediocre at best. With far more adept mixology talent in neighboring restaurants, it's hard to be enthusiastic about ordering drinks. The wines by the glass are only ok and also pale in comparison to most of their walking distance neighbors.Most disappointing though is the consistently dreadful music that couldn't be more unpleasant. With no acoustics and a mediocre sound system, all you hear is assaultive percussion and brass, or bad techno pop, too loud to be ignored and way too awful to be enjoyed. It fights the food, fights the mood one is usually looking for at dinner, and just makes you want to eat and leave. We used to come here at least once a week for dinner. Now we come much more rarely, but only because the drinks and music make it so much more pleasant to be elsewhere. If we have a craving for one of the specific dishes we still come. Otherwise, we've been going to Open Sesame next door, Melrose Bar & Grill, and a couple of others instead.....all evenings we would have normally gone to BLD.

I normally prefer crisp pancakes (hence my love of cornmeal hoecakes, and of buckwheat pancakes), but these babies could win me back to fluffy. They are light, thick, moist, and just slightly chewy--served with a glossily melting tin of whipped butter and an old-fashioned (i.e., cute but awkward to pour without spilling) decorative tin cabin of maple syrup. We split them three ways as a brunchy appetizer, and caught sight of a couple other tables doing likewise. I had a special (I know, not as useful for a review): duck pastrami and fried egg sandwich on ciabatta with a side of fries. (I note that the 3 potato options are shoestring fries, home fried potatoes with chorizo, and roasted fingerling potatoes--at prices of $5, $6, and $5.5, resepctively. This seems unnecessarily confusing and likely to irritate people who don't read menus closely. As a note to the restaurant, I'm sure you have your reasons, but I have several times seen people who'll drop $100 a head for a fancy meal get royally ticked over hidden surcharges of a buck or two.) In any case, the duck/egg sandwich was deliriously rich without quite being overpowering--though after a third of the pancake platter, I took half the sandwich home. My companions had the Ode to Butterfield's (eggs Benedict with steak) with the chorizo home fries; and the house burger with cheddar. The Benedict was good and the home fries quite tasty with thinly sliced, fried strips of chorizo. The burger was good though not outstanding.

I get the same thing every time b/c it is that good. The vegetable salad to start (order a whole one for yourself b/c it's really not that big). It's an awesome combination of textures and tastes from the crunchy jicama and toasted cashews to the softness of the avocado. Throw in edamame, fresh corn, haricots verts, and red peppers and WOW a flavor explosion with every bite. I have to say this is one of my favorite salads and I am a salad snob. Next up I order the self-constructed dinner. You get to choose a protein, sauce, and 2 sides. My choices always include: hemp seed crusted tofu with the arugula pesto, brussels sprouts, and creamy polenta. The tofu is prepared perfectly with a golden crust and moist, custardy interior that is unlike anything else. And the \u00a0arugula pesto gives a deliciously peppery finish, which complements the tofu. And this sits on a cloud of light, fluffy polenta that is so creamy and absolutely delicious. The brussels spouts are simply seasoned and like everything else taste amazing. \u00a0The \u00a0portion is very generous but somehow I manage to eat every last bite and sometimes I even get dessert :O)They have specials every night too including a soup, salad, entree, and even a special dessert like to-die for donuts on Wednesday night. Freshly made and severed warm with dipping sauces. My husband has had the braised short rib tacos which was one of his favorite specials. For regular menu items he has also tried the spicy shrimp, the house burger, and the BBQ Tofu with black beans, red quinoa, and vegan cream (that one is good too but I have to to get my usual b/c its too good to pass up). So far he has loved every dish but one of his favorites is the chicken and waffles. Prices are moderate to \"teetering on the expensive side\" but it's good food. If you go for dinner, you have to valet park. BLD is minimally decorated - no frills, no attitude, you can dress up or come in yoga clothes.

I got the Eggs Benedict with salmon and spinach. It was good. Though I think my English muffin was a bit too tough due to it being a little too friendly with the frying pan. Hollandaise sauce was bland, and after five bites everything just began to taste the same. Only saving factor was the French Press coffee (a whole pot for $4.50 guys.) as well as the Chorizo potatoes... Mmm gotta love potatoes smothered in spicy pig bits.

The house-smoked tofu was just a slab of tofu baked with barbecue sauce; the sweetness of the tofu didn't jive with the savory taste of the veggie patty (which was a mushy bean concoction).

The potatoes \u00a0in her dish were very good and had chorizo the size of a pepperoni. My lentil salad was quiet bland. I wish they had had salt and pepper on the table to give it more flavor, but was pretty scared for their lack of customer service.To summarize it.; both of us left more than half on our plate untouched. I couldn't eat such uninteresting food.We also had pastries, which were good, but not worth $11???Service: I must say I've never had this experience before.

Between plates of cornflake-crusted, compote-laden French toast and savory bowls of brisket hash, I've come to regard brunch as sort of a weekly holiday, celebrated with friends with fork and knife in hand. BLD is the perfect place to meet and catch up over mimosas and steal a bite (or three) off of your girlfriend's plate.Three of us arrived on Saturday at 11:00 to a 40-minute table wait. It was worth it, though! Here's what we ordered:Braised Pork & Poached Eggs (yelp.com/biz_photos/bld-\u2026): This was one of six benedict offerings, served on housemade pain de mie and topped with a sweet barbecue sauce and a tangy orange hollandaise. While the flavors worked quite well together, the pork shoulder was a bit sparse on the plate and the bread needed a bit more grilling to combat sogginess. 3 stars.Spicy Cuban-Style Pork Sandwich (yelp.com/biz_photos/bld-\u2026): Wow! This was wonderful. The pork was perfectly marinated with cumin, orange juice, and plenty of onions, then braised and paired with a sweeter housemade porchetta and topped with Dijon mustard and melted gruyere on a grilled torta roll. It may be the juiciest sandwich I've ever had, and it tasted a whole lot more complex than the ingredients suggest. A must-order, in my book! 5 stars.Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes (yelp.com/biz_photos/bld-\u2026): It's hard to go wrong with ricotta pancakes, but I think that my favorite is still at Gjelina. The presentation was lackadaisical (quite a few crusty edges to cut off) and the ricotta was globby and could have been folded into the batter a bit more. That being said, these pancakes were delicious!

Mostly looking at this place and all the pictures everyone comes for breakfast. But the name BLD stands for breakfast, lunch, dinner.It is close to my bf's place and it was a deal for $25, plus I looked at other dineLA reviews from dinner and they seemed good.Parking: Street metered parking and valet available. It's kinda hard to find street parking on this part of town. So it was pretty much a 3 course meal (appetizer, dinner, dessert). Some of the plates were really small, but I was satisfied by the end of my meal even though I didn't think I would, and we got something extra off the dineLA menu and some bread which filled us more!Bread and butter was good that they gave, I just love bread and butter in general ;)Lamb Kefta (4 stars): This was pretty good, lamb was tasty, lots of toppings and sauce was great! It was just a small little bite to share which was good.Now starting for the dineLA menu:Prosciutto wrapped dates (4.5 stars): I really liked these, good amount of saltiness from the prosciutto, dates were sweet, bread was awesome, and the pesto that came with it topped it all off.Beef Carpaccio (4 stars): This was a $6 supplement I believe, my bf seemed to like it, but it came with so little and at a supplement too you'd think you'd get more.Braised Lamb (5 stars): We both got this, it was actually SO good, the lamb was perfectly tender and fell off digging the fork in, the sauce was amazing, the polenta cake with it was so good and the spinach and carrots also complimented it. This dish was really really good. Too bad they don't have it on their actual menu!Cinnamon Beignets (5 stars): These were really good, warm and gooey inside with the perfect dipping sauce!Sticky toffee pudding (5 stars): This was equally as good, sticky toffee was def sticky, ice cream was awesome, everything was just good, the desserts here did not disappoint.Service here was good, she refilled our waters and checked on us, they also moved us away from the door since I hate sitting near the cold!

The aioli unfortunately didn't add anything to the sandwich. The potatoes with chorizo were also pretty pitiful. Sliced, oily potatoes were plated with a few slices of chorizo. There are too many better places to get a reasonably priced breakfast sandwich so I can't justify the $15 pricetag.Others at the table got the nutella and whipped cream crepes with a side of sausage, the ode to butterfield, the breakfast sandwich and the yogurt with granola. It seemed like the crepes and egg benedict were the best options out of the four. The yogurt pricing was ridiculous! - $5 for the yogurt, $5 for a small cup of fruit and $4 for granola...$14 for yogurt with granola?!?!!! Thankfully, we got an order of blueberry ricotta pancakes to split and they were actually pretty tasty but I can't imagine eating an entire order of those alone. They were rich but the fresh blueberries in them were really good.Well, I guess we can cross BLD off of our \"must try\" brunch list.

So I goggled places to eat in that area and I came across BLD, it was so close to where I was.I made it there, the place was not busy at all, so I sat and they brought me the menu. I asked the guy to bring me a coffee, and ten minutes latter he came with a French press coffee. It was cold and didn't taste like a good coffee \"very watery\". I was hoping for a regular coffee. Twenty minutes after that I decided to send one of the waiters a signal to get his attention, and see if someone could take my order, he told me to wait a little, then a few minutes later he showed up, I asked him if the \"Huevos rancheros\" where any good, and he said they were very good, so I decided to try them.Another twenty five minutes passed by and my breakfast was still in a \"Twilight Zone\", I was ready to call the girl standing close to the reception desk and ask her to cancel my order and get me a bill for the coffee, it was almost 11am, but luckily I looked to my right and saw a guy coming toward me with the huevos rancheros.I was so hungry after not having any sold food for three days, I started eating, and to my astonishment the huevos rancheros were far from what I thought, the flavor was \"nonexistent \", so bland and the eggs were so over cooked they almost tasted like rubber', my bill was $20.12.The worst breakfast I've ever had!. I left most of the food in my plate, paid my bill and walked to the front door with the biggest dismay.Last time I had huevos rancheros was at \"El Huarachito\" in Lincoln Heights, and they were the best.This place is totally overrated, the worst service I've ever seen.

If it was just a casual dinner, I would be glad to make her work easier since it seemed like she needed help and just leave right then.

He never rushed us through out the meal. Even the bus boy and the guy who seemed like a manager both stopped by to check up on us and were both warm and kind. Needless to say, food was great. Lamb was tender and delicious. By the time we were done, it was about 10 minutes past the hostess' \"required\" time for us to leave. The dining hall had at least empty 3-4 table and of course, no long line of people itching to take over our table as we went past 10 minutes of our \"due time\". So the restaurant was solidly booked and she was worried about making the other patrons wait. Maybe that made her anxious.

WHERE: The restaurant is smack dab on the corner of Beverly Blvd and Vista St. Even the entrance is right on the corner.AMBIANCE/SERVICE: I really like the ambiance and decor at BLD. The aesthetics were clean, simple, and very spacious. Even though they have plenty of tables inside, it doesn't feel crowded or claustrophobic at all. Our server was very nice and attentive. Again, we ended up being the last few people in the restaurant and they didn't rush us at all.FOOD:Appetizer - Charred Octopus (also shared the Prosciutto Dates): The octopus was pretty spicy and really has that charred taste. I was glad that the octopus wasn't chewy at all and was just cooked just right. I liked my bf's appetizer more though as it was both sweet and savory. Entree - Pan Seared Scallops (addt'l $6): I really wanted seafood that night, and this was their only seafood option that night. The scallops were cooked perfectly. I also really liked the potato hash and cabbage ragout. I pretty much cleaned up my plate that night.Dessert - Sticky Toffee Pudding: The dessert was ok. It wasn't that memorable for me and I ended up not finishing it (and I always finish my desserts).OVERALL: This was my second time dinning here for dineLA and I would rate is a ok at most.

I stared at BLD and kept wondering what in the world it stood for. Maybe initials? Maybe an acronym for a culinary technique? As I kept staring at B-L-D it finally hit me! Breakfast Lunch Dinner, DUH!Phew! I did have a lot of time on my hands considering the wait time at 11:30 am for Sunday Brunch was 30-45 minutes but luckily we scored some seats at the bar 20 minutes in. If you like personal space and cleanliness definitely avoid the bar. During peak hours they have dirty cups and dishes laying around from previous patrons which is slightly messy but they wipe down your area and are relatively patient for such a fast paced establishment. Our waitress took our drink order and I was split between booze or coffee. Two of my most favorite things that sadly don't really mix that well so I settled for a French Press Coffee to share with my girls. Let me tell you, BLD understands what coffee is! Velvety yet smooth with a rich aroma that resembles Armenian Coffee. My girlfriends and I decided to all get 3 different dishes and swap them around. I bet people were staring at us as we shifted plates after a few bites. We of course ordered the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes which deserve all the acclaim it gets. The ricotta isn't blended into their pancake batter but some how mixes in with chunks of blueberries; heaven served with a side of maple syrup. We also ordered the Eggs Benedict with steak and the Egg & Mushroom frittata. Both amazing, especially with their potato sides. My only complaint was that the food didn't come out so hot. I expect that from such a busy restaurant, but hopefully next time I get my food warm where I'll need to blow a little air and then indulge. Great breakfast. So, I've taken down the B aspect of BLD, now to conquer L & D.

The Ode to Butterfield was very delicious. I've never had steak for breakfast, but this was perfect. I ordered the steak to be medium rare and it was just right, juicy, and full of flavor.

Lastly, our waiter also recommended the blueberry pancakes. One thing to note is that my bf and I are not a fan of pancakes, but we gave it a try. We thought it was actually very delicious.

Comes with 2 big sized pancakes served with butter and the cutest little metal tin house with syrup inside. I would recommend sharing this dish because it's pretty huge for one person. The texture is very fluffy and the blueberries are fresh. Although today it was served a bit on room temperature instead of warm and was a bit short on the blueberries.

Yes I tried to stay healthy and carb free so I can enjoy the Blueberry pancakes and feel less guilty haha :) Good portion. Great generous portions of mushrooms with spinach and shallots. You can also get fruits for extra which is also fresh and good portion. If you love mushrooms this is a must!_Spanish Scramble. This dish had a nice Spanish kick to it. A bit salty with a nice spice. Chorizo, fingerling potatoes, roasted peppers, paprika, and manchego cheese. This dish is packed with flavor and great for those who lean more towards the salty side. _Braised Pork and Poached egg. This dish is great with succulent flavors from the braised pork. A nice salty and sweet flavor. Although it was great in flavor, for me it was a little too rich of a dish. From the pork to the poached egg yolk, hollandaise sauce potatoes and grilled bread it was real heavy on the stomach. There french press coffee is a must! They also have almond milk for those that are lactose free. A little overpriced but you pay for the name and location.

BLD serves up incredibly delicious, hearty, comforting breakfasts with a meal to suit every palate. There was a 5 minute wait for a 2pm on Sunday morning for our party of 3, but it was barely a wait. The 3 of us split 3 meals, which turned out to be all vegetarian even though we didn't intend for it to be (we like our meat). - Florentine Eggs benedict: A really unique presentation where they served the poached eggs, spinach and potatoes in a separate dish than the homemade english muffins to keep it dry (i guess). The eggs were perfectly poached while the hollandaise on top was not too thick nor too light. Flavor was definitely more on the less-seasoned, \"refreshing\" side, but it's an excellent healthier breakfast option! Great for those watching their waistlines but still want good flavor. \u00a0- Blueberry Ricotta pancakes: Two layers of thick pancakes that comes with a side of their warmed up maple syrup (the BEST part!). The pancakes were more dense and chewy, and less fluffy than I expected, which was a bit of a downer. But flavor was good. I probably wouldn't order these again just because it wasn't very memorable. \u00a0- 3 Bean Huevos Rancheros: Super hearty and \"splurge-y\" meal! A couple of layers of fried taco tortilla's with avocado and salsa serves atop. Swimming in a thick pool of 3 bean \"stew\".

She got something called blossoms. It was stuffed with a cheese and fried. Quite tasty. I got the scallops to start. The sauce on top of them was perfect. I just wanted to eat the sauce by itself. Next we each ordered the sea bass. It came with thin sliced tomatoes, squash, and possibly an eggplant. Everything on the plate was wonderful. Then we each ordered a dessert!! She got the little donuts. They tasted sort of like a funnel cake but better and no powdered sugar on top. You must eat them while they are still warm. They are a great treat. I ordered the semifreddo. It was a frozen custard on top of a thin molasses cookie. Very delicious. Like eating ice cream that never really melts. For cocktail beverages she got the gin and juice.

Apart from the inside being super moist, the best part was something I couldn't have expected.

I've only tried the breakfast food here and I can easily say that it was one of the best breakfasts of my life. My boyfriend took me here on a day that was perfectly sunny and warm so I was able to soak in the LA vibe and enjoy my meal outside. The interior is bright, and modern and the servers are on top of their game. After looking through the menu, we knew that we had to try the Vegan Tomato Soup since it is a favorite of ours. When it came out, it was the most gorgeous shade of red and tasted super fresh. It was the perfect appetizer to our entrees and just the right portion to share. I'm a bit of an eggs benedict snob so when I saw that BLD had a pretty extensive list of benedicts, I had to order the Pulled Pork and Poached Eggs Benedict with chorizo potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the Fried Egg Sandwich with fingerling potatoes. If there is one thing that BLD does right, it's eggs. The term \"yolkporn\" is totally appropriate here. I'm picky about my poached eggs being done right on my benedict. BLD has got it down to an artform. It was a perfect poached egg that just oozed yolk when I sliced through it and made me the happiest girl ever. I was a little hesitant about the pulled pork but it went along really nice with their hollandaise. Their hollandaise was more lemony and tart than I was used to but it helped cut through the rich pork. My boyfriend's Fried Egg sandwich was out of this world. I mean how can a fried egg sandwich be that good? Perfectly toasted, and it was definitely comfort food done right. My chorizo potatoes came with pepperoni on it which was good if you need a little more meat in your meal. I preferred my boyfriend's plain fingerling potatoes. BLD is a bit on the pricey end but it is worth every penny. The servers know what they are talking about and my water was never empty.

We wanted to still celebrate without the stress, and we decided to have a Valentine's Day breakfast at BLD. I've been wanting to try BLD for years since I saw the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\" Unlike other places, they take reservations for breakfast. It was great in case it was busy and to get my Open Table points. Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes (3 stars) - I would not call it the best thing I ever ate. The flavor combination was unique. Before I try any pancake, I like to assess the flavor without any syrup. Without the maple syrup, the ricotta made the pancake savory. With the addition of the syrup, it was transformed into the blueberry's sweet creamy companion. It was good pancake just not a great pancake. It was fluffy but not as fluffy and memorable as something I would order at Griddle Cafe or Flappy Jack's Pancake House. Fried Egg Sandwich (4 stars) - This is what my boyfriend ordered, and I was jealous this wasn't my plate. We did a mid-meal swap so I was able to try this yummy sandwich. I loved the thick slices of bacon. The gruyere and aioli were subtle. They added a creaminess but their distinct flavors didn't stand out like the bacon and egg. Spanish Chorizo Home Fries (4 stars) - I'm drawn to menu items that feature chrorizo. I enjoyed the combination of potatoes and thinly sliced chorizo. No ketchup was needed for this flavorful side. Iced Mocha (4 stars) - It tasted so good. There were like little flecks of dark chocolate in each sip. We loved the taste that we were even tempted to order another one. Unfortunately, this did not give us a great caffeinated kick we expected since we were already yawning an hour later. Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice (5 stars) - This was chilled and from freshly squeezed oranges with no added sugar. It may be weird that I include a rating for juice. However, you would be surprised how many times I've had warm orange juice and orange juice concentrate. Service (3 stars) - Although the staff was very nice and friendly, service was a bit slow. We received our drinks immediately. However, the food took a while considering the places was just a little over half full. It's a nice breakfast spot, and we will be back.

Nothing like their breakfast/brunch crowds.First course:My friend and I split our first courses so we could be fatties ... ahem ... I mean foodies and try more than one. HOUSEMADE GREEN KALE PASTA with mascarpone cheese, crispy prosciutto. Honestly didn't get any crispy Prosciutto, but it was creamy and satisfying. Nothing mind blowing. CRAB FALAFEL. Not a fan unfortunately. Looked like two crab cakes, but it was \"bready\" as my friend described it. My taste buds were searching for hints of crab and just couldn't find any. Tasted dry. The proportion of ingredients seemed off. I didn't enjoy it, even with the sauce. I didn't eat it all and I was hungry. Also didn't get why the flatbread was there. The fact that it's housemade didn't say much. For $6 supplement, get the DUCK CONFIT CREPES. Those were good. And yes, I tried another friend's item. Second course: BACON WRAPPED PORK TENDERLOIN. Yum! Rosemary johnny cakes, grilled endive, braised shallots, apple cider glaze. Presentation was architectural. Third Course:FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE W/ MINT CHIP ICE CREAM. \u00a0Can't go wrong here. It will satisfy any chocolate lover's craving, but it wasn't something I'd return for on it's own. I have to say that although the meal wasn't bad, the B wins out over the D. Brave the crowd and come for some blueberry ricotta pancakes and any of their benedicts. I have dreams about that pancake. :)Parking: Sucks ass. I drove around and couldn't find anything except a meter 5 blocks away. I finally gave up and went with valet. Dude tried ripping us off at the end of the \u00a0night. Sure it would've only been $5.50 +tip, but the teeny-tiny print said $4 with validation. We had validation. He mumbled something about how \"that's only for lunch time.\" I looked closer and it didn't say that...then he back tracked saying \"oh, you have validation?\" Come on! I gave him a $10 and he said \"how much you want to give me?\" Uhhh $4. You just tried ripping us off buddy. Not to mention my car was right there parked in front and you handed me my key. Felt a little bad afterward since they did have orange cones around my car to deter traffic while others cars were off remote somewhere else. Still!

The interior was dim and cozy. Definitely not a place to bring young kids. I was surprised how much open space the restaurant had and I really loved the modern and simple d\u00e9cor. Libations: I ordered the spicy jalape\u00f1o margarita, and it was sooo delicious! It was tangy with a little kick to it! I thought it would come in a big margarita glass, but it came in a small glass cup. I wished it were bigger, but the flavor of the margarita made up for it! I would definitely come back for this again!Food: We ordered the charcuterie plate. Came with a lot of fixin's but very small slice of Brie. A lot of slices of 2 types of bread, some almonds, olives, and also a lot of slices of really thin salami. The salami was very good, as well as Brie, but the slice of the Brie was just oh so tiny! As for my main course, I ordered the fried chicken and waffles. It was my first time ever eating fried chicken and waffles and the chicken was very delicious! I definitely loved the maple ginger gastrique on the chicken, as for the waffle it was just alright. It was a great combo, but I wish the waffle was a little more crispier. Although, I guess it balanced out with the chicken because the chicken was very crispy. I really loved the dish nonetheless. Service: Our server was just \"alright\". He was helpful with the menu but as for his service, he could've done a little better. Although, I do give it to their service for always having the water magically filled! Overall: I would definitely come back to this place for a special occasion, or a celebration. I loved the food and drinks. However, I would not com back on a random night if I were craving for a margarita and fried chicken. This place is pretty pricey and the bill for the 3 of us came out to nearly $130. My two friends ordered a salad and drink!

I also had a glazed pecan doughnut and a chocolate filled doughnut. These are not your ordinary doughnuts! They are gourmet housemade doughnuts! They are really, really doughy. Kind of the sameincredible sensation of eating your mom's cake dough. The dough has a slight salty taste which goes well with the sweetness of the doughnut. I have never had a doughnut quite like these in my whole life! What a find!You can try the doughnuts on doughnut night which is on Wednesdays. Of particular note \u00a0is the fact that they change up the doughnuts! Right now they have cajeta doughnuts which simply sound delicious!Soon there will be an annex called ICDC or Ice Cream, Doughnuts and Coffee which will open around June. That's how good these doughnuts are!I got to meet doughnut chef Mariah Swan who was quite visibly enthusiastic about her creations and the event that showcased them. Her assistant was a really nice person and filled me in on some other things. BLD has really attentive wait staff. My water glass was never empty. They offered us really good french pressed coffee which paired fabulously with the doughnuts!Parking is no problem during the day. Vista Street has two hour free parking.

We ordered Vegan Benedict, the classic Eggs Benedict and hot tea that came in a cute, yet mysterious-looking, metal contraption. I must say, I've never had a benedict done vegan before. The Vegan Benedict came with veggie patty, wilted arugula and smoked tofu bacon on an english muffin, topped with hollandaise sauce and your choice of potatoes: I chose the Spanish chorizo home fries. I'm already a huge fan of veggie patties but the benedict itself was soooo good. Unfortunately, the home fries were too dry for my taste; I did enjoy the chorizo slices though, it gave the potatoes a nice kick. Our waiter had recommended the fingerling potatoes.

We thought it was going to be smooth sailing until the entrees came. My sea bass with red rice and a pea puree and was healthy but bland. I loved that it was very light but it definitely needed a lot more flavor. I tried the duck which was pretty forgettable too. Dessert was average-- neither great nor bad. Surprisingly (or maybe not so much so in hindsight), the regular menu was much better. The fried chicken with maple gastrique and butter was really, really good. I'm used to eating it with gravy but this version was light and didn't make me miss it at all. I also had a bite of a pasta with chicken that was delicious. Thinking back, a pitfall of dineLA is that the food on the dineLA menu doesn't always live up those on the regular menu, and that can turn away a diner such as myself.

The desserts then arrived- 3 donut holes with dulce de leche and a dollop of whipped cream. \u00a0They were quite lovely. \u00a0Oh- my friend's her wine pairings (which were an $18 add-on option with the Dine LA deal) were all \u00a0wonderful. \u00a0When the waitress came back with the bill, she explained they had knocked off another amount (something like $8?) as a neighbor discount. \u00a0OK thanks. \u00a0I appreciated the sentiment, but it still felt kind of dribbly. \u00a0If I were them, I would have just knocked the \u00a0whole chicken off. \u00a0It's not the $-value as much as the full admission that this was an insensitive mistake. \u00a0Of course an honest oversight- but an insensitive one at that. \u00a0Anyway, I have a feeling this place will get better as it goes along, but I'm far from eager to go back.", "Date": "2014-02-01", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Natosha P.", "ReviewID": "1WZgBERbq2VcN2LO3r-XWA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would definently recommend the strawberry & cream cheese french toast.

This comes stacked high on a thick english muffin, a nice crumbly crab/tuna patty, then topped with that super soft poached egg. I love egg benedicts so much! \u00a0Honestly, you don't even need the hollandaise, it's so flavorful without it, plus you'll cut a few hundred calories not having it. Actually, this stack is probably not as healthy as expected but whatever. Its the weekend okay?! \u00a0The crab/tuna cake is light, flaky and slightly spicy. The side potatoes with chorizo are delicious. My friend got the blueberry ricotta pancake because she wanted something sweet. I don't know how they do it, but its light, buttery, and delicious. Even my non pancake eating friend admitted it was like none other. Someone please teach \u00a0me how to make good pancakes. My pancakes looks so bllllaahhhh all the time. I have to go to Mcdonalds to replace it sometimes. Booo. My other friend had the Eggs Florentine, which the presentation looked fun. The egg came in it's own little mini pot thing and she had to put her Benedict together which wasn't very easy. Dish looked pretty but hard to eat. But she liked it.Anyway, the restaurant gets packed so be prepared to wait and parking is street so it sucks. There is never parking on the street. i always have to park really far. Darn LA. Service was prompt and the restaurant itself is nice and open.

First, I want to talk about the design of the restaurant. It looks really nice inside and has an understated, but upscale quality to it. And even with its contemporary atmosphere, the waitstaff at BLD is extremely nice, too, so it's not like you're eating at a self-righteous, holier-than-thou kind of place. If I had one complaint, it'd be that it is very dark inside the dining room. Turn on some lights and show off how great the place looks!To eat, I got the fried egg sandwich with chorizo homefries. While I would normally refrain from getting such a simple thing out to eat (something I could have easily made at home), but this sandwich was the tastiest and most on point breakfast sandwich I've ever had. The sourdough bread was crispy, but just a little to provide some crunch, but was still very much soft and easily edible. Next, the fried egg was perfectly runny, adding richness to everything around it. The gruyere cheese was nice and melted, adding saltiness along with some amazingly smoky bacon. Finally, in a stroke of genius, they add some tangy aioli to the sandwich, adding extra richness and moisture. The chorizo homefries were fantastic. Along with some flavorful herbs, the chorizo added some nice saltiness. Importantly, the potatoes were cooked perfectly--outside they had a tiny bit of crunch, but were very soft and pillowy inside. For the quality and big portions, this place justifies its prices, which are a little bit of a splurge. I paid $17 with tip for my sandwich, potatoes and water. But, it was worth it, trust me. I would definitely come back to BLD for a nice brunch (or lunch, or dinner).", "Date": "2012-12-17", "Author_Location": "Irvine, CA"}, {"Author": "Nykeia T.", "ReviewID": "yz6fMDynL4w5KZDb9XUHMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OMG!

It was a Saturday afternoon and they were pretty busy. But some things should just not fly, so I will try to only harp on issues that really seem like they could be prevalent in general. I mean, I say that, but I will probably just write stream-of-consciousness like I always do. Cheers.One of the bartenders working that day was insanely slow. Like, the slowest ever. I don't really know how their ticket system works, but it seems like they just keep forwarding them down the line until they end up in a silver dish somewhere collecting dust until Indiana Jones finds them and switches them out with a tiny bag filled with sand. Why the person behind the bar taking the order didn't make the drink is confusing to me. A vodka/OJ took at least 10 minutes. The place was busy but there were tons of staff. Maybe she was just a barista, because long after I ordered I saw her messing with milk, as opposed to juice or vodka. It's not like I ordered some artisanal cocktail where they were shaving ice off a block with a straight razor - the wait was just way too long. Why would she call us endearing names likes \"boo\" and \"sweetheart\" but leave us so thirsty? I bought a friend a mimosa that took over 15 minutes ... we were seated and it never came and I finally had to ask a manager/owner-type about it, at which point it promptly arrived. Proving things can get done when you ask the right person.The menu is overpriced. I don't care if this is LA. I wasn't sitting next to RDJ. If I'm paying $16 for a hamburger, it should be a bit more impressive. It wasn't bad, though.Our waitress was friendly, though not overly attentive. I understand that it was busy, but even when she was at the table, she would drop plates/drinks so quick that you could't get a word in. I ordered extra dressing on the side ... it didn't come so I asked for it. I was told it was on the burger. I said, great, but I still need some on the side, too. (I'm obsessed with condiments, I'm gross.) It took most of my meal for it to arrive. My poor fries were so so dry. Haha, okay, whatever.

Don't they want us to order lots of drinks?I would give this place a 2, but our waitress had a weird sense of humor I loved even though it weirded out my friends.

Oh yeah, and the sink in the men's room spits like a freaking firehose when it comes out and splashes all over you so you get to walk by pretty girls at the bar on the way back to your table looking like your peed all over your shirt.

But I had the fried egg sandwich, and I am going to openly admit that I am not American, that I do not have those peculiarly evolved taste buds that dictate this glorious country (and lead it to ruin). I am entirely bias - I do not think that fried is instantly better. In fact, sometimes I am so un-American that I can't even imagine how the word \"fried\" relates to certain food. Fried egg? What does that even mean? I think in my head I was imagining it poached. I hate poached egg. But recently I've been seeing a lot of photos of poached eggs on instagram and I've felt kind of entranced by it and a little obsessed. I was *hoping* it was a poached egg. Okay, I guess I was being stubborn, it happens. The fried egg sandwich consists of five parts - egg, cheese, aioli, bacon and bread.Fired egg is not poached - pretty much ever (I think). Fried egg \u00e0 la BLD isn't really sunny side up egg either (as Google claims). It's kind of a rendition of sunny side up egg. It's sunny side up egg, but maybe extra oily. And not sunny side up, but overcast. Winter in LA. Summer in SF. Somewhere there. Okay. It is kind of the version of sunny side up egg that you don't want.America is famous for mostly one thing - that every food has cheese on it. The fried egg sandwich has cheese on it. I really love cheese. I love cheese so much that I judge people for not liking cheese. But my love for cheese has culinary limits. You can't know until you try it, but I do not like overcast eggs in oil and cheese. I think what I don't like about this combination is that it tastes like a heart attack might feel. I've never had a heart attack, but I want it as little as I want cheese on my eggs. As novice as I may seem to the American culinary arena, I have learned one important lesson. I hate aioli. I hate it, because it is basically a fancy version of mayonnaise, and mayonnaise is not very fancy to begin with. I ordered my sandwich without aioli, and I cannot even begin to imagine the implications of aioli on this breakfast sandwich. Can somebody please not put cheese and aioli on every food in America?Bacon is basically always delicious. Except when it is super thick and has a lot of white parts, because that is a little disgusting. I ate the crispy parts, but then I ate it all, because it's bacon and have you ever tried to eat bacon, but not all the way? It's impossible.My favorite part of the sandwich was the bread. I like bread a lot, especially if it is toasted and hard. Some of the bread had a lot of molten cheese on it, and I didn't like it, but then I ate also those parts because my love for bread overpowers my dislike of very cheesy and oily bread. I think the Fried Egg Sandwich is the best breakfast in the world if you are American. If you are not American you will either love it because it is so American, or not really love it, because it is so American! But please take a photo of it and put it on instagram, because everyone wants to know what you are eating, always. It was a Thursday morning, the place was practically empty and the service was attentive and friendly. Free WiFi.Sides: Fruit PlateDisappointing in both selection and presentation.

The yogurt sauce that accompanied it was a great simple match to the meat. The bun, hearty with a egg flavor, was tasty -- even if I only DO eat half the bun in general.

It was really good and it is a lot for just one person. However, be aware, if you do not like cheese or do not do well with too much cheese, skip the pancakes. The pancakes batter is mixed in with cheese so it can be pretty heavy and unfitting for certain people. One of my friends did not feel as good after her meal.

I resisted the temptation to go and I found out why after New Years Eve. Table of six. Great company. Poorly executed service and over 60% of the meal was just a mistake. More often than not, a pre-fixed menu gives the kitchen somewhat of a 'night off'- \u00a0because the back of the house can concentrate on putting out a limited number of dishes.The Amuse Bouche was a (IE one) small oyster on a bed of salt. An oyster with a food cost of $1 did not satisfy us until our next course- which arrived ten minutes later. \u00a0One dish that stuck out (in a good way) was the seared duck with chard. The name of the dish escapes me, but I was impressed by all the components (taste, presentation, the fact that it was hot and the portion was respectable). I got my second course eight minutes after my guests got their dishes. I noticed that a supplemental charge was offered for a scallop dish that didn't look very 'supplemental'. The restaurant continued to apply this charge when the kitchen was out of one of the 2nd courses. Are you kidding me? Certain dishes (like the main course) were far from hot. The steak was like warm and tough as hell (and no, I haven't been there). The dessert was an inexcusable attempt at a chocolate truffle cake. The frosting was way too thick, sugary and stiff (from being in a fridge too long, destroying the flavor and texture). The cake's presentation was weak and dry. The Creme Anglaise was a savior because I needed that sauce to moisten the cake.BLD is not cheap. I never mind paying for a good meal, but this place should hold on before they try to fall in line with other establishments they're attemplting to replicate. Small plates of bad food do not warrant $70 a head (before drinks). BLD is trendy, and that seems to be the draw.This place isn't the Peninsula Hotel, Patina or Joes on Abbot Kinney.

The wait was a standard 20ish minutes, but we didn't mind as we soaked up some sun until our name was called.

The minute the braised pork and poached egg benedict ($14) graced the table, I knew I would be in brunch euphoria. The meat was caramelized, which added a nice sweetness and the egg was masterfully poached and drizzled out a liquid treat in yolk form to help give the dish a bit of mushy texture that I adore. I opted for the rosemary french fries since my girlfriend got the olive oil roasted fingerling potatoes, and both were a great accompaniment.

The venue encompasses a posh, sizable interior, sidewalk seating, large windows that curved around the street corner, and a panoramic view that brought sunshine coming from the busy streets. We were quickly seated by the sidewalk equip with an overhead heat lamp that added to the rising temperature coming from the sun. The noise level was high, but the overall vibe was slow and relaxing on this glorious weekend.We ordered the Braised Pork & Poached Eggs ($14) and Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes ($13) to share. I was very pleased that our food was nicely presented and evenly divided on separate plates when they arrived at the table. The egg was perfectly runny with a drizzle of citrus hollandaise sauce sitting on top of tender braised pork and grilled toast. The quality of the hollandaise sauce was medium thick without the anticipated citrus undertone. The braised pork was juicy, tender, but needed more flavor, and the toast was a little soggy in otherwise a tasty dish. My primary complaint was the side of fingerlings that were bland with a plastic-like candied potato skin that didn't match up to the range of finesse textures. Even though the server confirmed that the Braised Pork & Poached Eggs was his clear favorite, I thought the price, flavor, and value could be much better.The Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes were very impressive. They were soft, fluffy and easy to cut at the touch of the knife with good moisture stemming from the embedded ricotta and blueberries. My serving was thick and wide with a few crispy spots hot off the griddle. The most impressive was the large amount of fresh plump blueberries tucked within each bite, and served with maple syrup and whipped butter to bring together mouthfuls of wow factor. The price is hipstercentric but I still recommend it.All together, it was a big meal that came with thrusts of wow factors. Service was sporadic but our needs were met at the right moments.

luckily, a little container of ketchup was provided with the home fries.I tried a little bit of the warm lentil salad. \u00a0Warm lentils mixed with arugula, cherry tomatoes and pancetta; the lentils were topped with two fried eggs. \u00a0The lentils were good and I liked the arugula. \u00a0The pancetta needed to be a little crisper. \u00a0Daniel G. liked his Caesar Salad though he felt that his tuna sandwich was a little on the dry side and the fries were too crisp.Prices were not cheap, but they were reasonable given the quality and the decent portion size. \u00a0I thought my Benedict with the option of any potato was bigger than other similar places in the same price range. \u00a0All of their brunch dishes were under $20; ordering a starter is really not necessary; that being mentioned, those large ricotta blueberry pancakes would be good for sharing (did not have them, but they looked good).I remember having a very good and friendly waitress on our last visit (during dinner when it was less busy). \u00a0I am usually pretty easy on service in my reviews because I often get friendly and good service (and if there are mishaps, they are often not worth mentioning). \u00a0That being said, our waitress today was not that good. \u00a0She seemed a little short and abrupt with us when ordering.Food did come out pretty quick. \u00a0My drink was a different story. \u00a0I had ordered a Coke, but I had to ask the waitress twice and then three other servers for it. \u00a0I was starting to think that this Coke was just not going to happen. \u00a0It was brought towards the end when I was almost done with my meal. \u00a0This may not be indicative of the typical service here; we may have just caught them when they were a little too busy (and caught the waitress on a bad day).The food was definitely good enough to return. \u00a0And the prices were reasonable enough where this could be somewhat of a regular spot and not just a special occasion spot. \u00a0I am taking the assumption that the less than stellar service was an anomaly. \u00a0If you live near here, BLD is a good brunch option.Valet parking is available for $5.50. \u00a0Street parking by meter is also available.", "Date": "2010-04-01", "Author_Location": "Playa del Rey, CA"}, {"Author": "Cesar R.", "ReviewID": "S1YAkhQvvcLG41mMxMku5g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BEST.

"Overall": "3.0", "Content": "GF, Ciara G. and I went here for Sunday Brunch. \u00a0I'm disappointed to say I would have given BLD five stars were it not for the terrible service. \u00a0For such an amazing culinary experience, this is one of the most disorganized, poorly run establishments I have ever eaten at. \u00a0There are a number of things that added up to this conclusion. \u00a0It was very busy with a large crowd of people waiting, so I can understand the 25 minute wait we had before being seated, even though it was at an off hour. \u00a0However, things just went downhill from there. \u00a0One big problem was our server's poor communication skills, lack of follow through, flippant attitude and lack of good service. \u00a0For starters we ordered the one thing this restaurant is well known for, the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes, but were told by our server that \"The griddle is at full capacity so it will be an extra 30 minutes before they are ready\". \u00a0We looked at each other and since we were all starving, rather than waiting, I also ordered the Banana Nutella Crepes and asked that they be brought out first. \u00a025 minutes later when the crepes were finally brought out the whipped cream had melted, as if it had been sitting out the whole time. \u00a0Our server shrugged and made a flippant comment like \"yeah, it's melted but it's still delicious\". \u00a0The crepes were delicious and cooked perfectly, apart from the whipped cream having melted into a gooey mess. \u00a0Then the pancakes came 5 minutes later. \u00a0What was the point of me even ordering the crepes in the first place then???The Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes were OK but not this transcendent culinary experience so many people have described it as. \u00a0Some pancakes had hardly any berries while others were overloaded with them. \u00a0I barely tasted any Ricotta. \u00a0Then we were told by our server that they were \"out of Chorizo Home Fries\", another of their supposedly signature dishes, so I ordered the Fingerling Potatoes as my side instead. \u00a0However, when our entrees arrived, all of them had Chorizo Home Fries and no fingerling potatoes were in sight. \u00a0Not only that but my portion of the CHF's was literally twice the size of GF's. \u00a0So either they gave me too much or her too little. \u00a0My entree was amazingly delicious. \u00a0The \"Ode to Butterfield's\" came with a seared flat iron steak over poached eggs and an English Muffin topped with a Cabernet infused Hollandaise sauce. \u00a0GF had the Salmon Benedict, which was also delicious but had way too much salt for my palate. \u00a0The salt simply overpowered this dish. \u00a0The side of bacon we ordered was also sublime, thick and chewy, salty but not overly so, a hint of sweetness in the aftertaste. \u00a0During the service, our waitress never checked on us, not even so much as to fill a water glass. \u00a0I had to chase down a busboy and ask for clean silverware because my knife was visibly dirty. \u00a0And this was AFTER the big brunch crowd had dissipated. \u00a0It may sound like I'm nitpicking but if I'm going to drop $100 on brunch for 3 people I expect a higher level of service than we got at BLD. \u00a0WAY higher. \u00a0At the end, Ciara G. approached the manager and explained that she worked in the food industry, and went over all the details with

dinner, *clap*clap*. I had no idea where we were going and when we arrived at BLD, I still had no idea where we were since their name is hidden in their logo. I then thought it to be an amazing coincidence that my friends happened to be eating there at the same time! Good stuff.But the joy was short lived. The menu seamed pleasant enough; meats, cheeses, burgers, etc. All I could ask for. We ordered a meat and cheese plate for the table with four meats and four cheeses. At over $10 an item, this turned out to be the most expensive meat and cheese platter I've ever seen! Close to $100 for this;yelp.com/biz_photos/Y4Cc\u2026Was it worth it? Not even a little bit. I was delighted that they had Epoisses on the cheese list but when it came out ice cold, it was robbed off all its funky characteristics. The rest of the meats and cheeses were okay, on par with what LA has to offer, but the price was just so offensive, I'm still mad and I didn't even pay for the meal.Looking past that, my \"burger\" was the grand failing of the night. There were issues from top to bottom. The bun was burnt to the point where I had to chip away at the carbon flavoring to taste anything else. A layer down was a combo of apple chipotle ketchup and caramelized onions that packed such a powerful punch of sweetness, little else could be tasted. This mush was the textural equivalent of the meat. I've never had such a weak grind of beef. It was more like a loosely packed meatloaf that had been so over mixed that it was close to a puree. yelp.com/biz_photos/Y4Cc\u2026There was no beef flavor the texture was the worst part. Luckily they overcooked my order of medium-rare, else I doubt the patty could have held its form out of the kitchen. The fries were okay, but nothing worth writing more about. yelp.com/biz_photos/Y4Cc\u2026My poor friends were all equally unimpressed with their meals as well.

I was feeling kind of smug at this point, as BLD was my recommendation, and I am desperately needy for my in-laws' approval, since they have granted me the right to be wedded to their only child, who grew up handsome but rather fragile and asthmatic. \u00a0Let's get something out of the way now: the food at BLD is five-star food. \u00a0Six-star food, even. \u00a0We enjoyed a charcuterie plate of manchego and toscano salami that included the most delicious honey-flavored membrillo I have ever had in my life. \u00a0We had the fresh tagliatelle with mint and lamb sausage that was a textural delight. \u00a0We also had the jambalaya special, whose authentic kick and quality reminded me of the dishes I enjoyed in New Orleans. \u00a0What kind of magical chef fairy is back there in that kitchen? \u00a0Good God.You serve food like this and the world will, for the most part, forgive your flaws. \u00a0But my embarrassment will not allow me to forgive the wait we had to endure last night. \u00a0We're patient people. \u00a0We don't make scenes. \u00a0But twenty minutes before our order is taken? \u00a0Twenty minutes more for charcuterie? \u00a0Forty minutes (\"Just a couple of minutes\") before entrees? \u00a0We sat there with empty plates for twenty more minutes after we were done. \u00a0My father-in-law got out his semaphores to flag down the waiter for the check. \u00a0Guess how long that took. \u00a0Our waiter was so inaccessible that we asked our busser and other servers to go and get him. \u00a0Yeah, cute cake tin for the check. \u00a0No, not so cute if, in a fit of suppressed rage, my husband had to take it over to the bar, where our waiter was hanging out with some staff, to get it totaled. \u00a0Yes, we know that ce n'est pas un snack-bar. \u00a0But at the end of a weekday, after work and various activities, regular folks are kind of tired. \u00a0We like to linger over wine, but not that long. \u00a0This was quite bad. \u00a0And I was really embarrassed. \u00a0Thanks, BLD.", "Date": "2010-07-16", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "JC K.", "ReviewID": "28rAayqAHbJjjaVGGVcTCw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "BLD.

However, here, they seemed to have realized these problems and made sure that you can sit comfortably in a plushy seat with a back and somewhere to put your feet comfortably as well.The service was pretty fast although they did have some glitches. They only give you one bagel for your smoked salmon plate that already costs around $16 and they charge you for extra bagels even though there is not conceivable way for you to finish all the salmon they give you in one bagel even if you are gluttonously stuffing your one bagel to death. Besides that their benedict was awesome and the blueberry pancakes were just out of this world. I think lately I've had some what of a huge pancake obsession so anywhere that serves up a delicious pancake is just fantastic. They introduced to me a new kind of Argentinian wine that I had not had before, I can't say the name but it's the white version of their popular Malbec which has rocked the wine world!

I loved the look of the restaurant. The dim lighting makes this place a perfect date spot. 4 stars for the ambiance of the place. Our server was very friendly; another 4 stars for the service. The food was good. Some dishes were far better than others. What really bugged me about the place was that they seemed to run out of EVERYTHING on the menu.The moment we sat down, our waiter announced that they were out of the tuna poke and the sea bass. When our waiter came back to take our orders 10 minutes later, he announced that they were also out of the octopus. We were super bummed. He told us that they would be replacing the octopus with shrimp, and instead of the Ahi Poke, they would be serving a seared albacore cake. Both dishes sounded OK (not as good as the original dishes), so we went ahead and ordered both.Then when it was time to bring us dessert.Our server announced that they were out of all the dessert items we had ordered. No more brown sugar ice cream for the ice cream sandwiches and no more salted caramel custard.WHAT??? 5 MISSING DISHES IN ONE NIGHT?! We arrived at 7:30 on a Sunday for dinner. That doesn't seem that late to me.The shrimp dish was unimpressive. The shrimp had a nice smokiness, but it was really lacking in flavor otherwise. The greens that the shrimp was served on was fresh. The dressing was tangy and pretty good. But the different elements of this dish just didn't meld together at all. On top of all this, the presentation was horrible. Definitely not the best looking dish.The seared albacore cake really didn't have a ton of flavor either. The tuna was fresh and very tender, \u00a0but the dish was really unimpressive.The mussels were very good. The sauce was great. I really enjoyed this dish. My only issue with this dish was that a couple of the mussels were completely closed. Meaning they were already dead when the chef prepared the dish. Not cool.The Kabucha squash salad was good. The squash was very good. The greens were tender and worked well with the flavors of the squash. Sadly, I didn't really taste the pumpkin pesto that was listed on the menu. The squash bottoms were FANTASTIC. My favorite thing all night. The cheese was amazing. The sauce was perfect. Excellent dish.Cajun mac and cheese. Great flavors, very rich, very filling. Nothing extraordinary, but a very solid and delicious pot of mac and cheese.The lamb skewers were also great. The meat was very tender and flavorful. The tangerine sauce was fantastic. Very fresh, and countered the deep flavors of the lamb very well.Dessert was great. Not what we had originally ordered, but it was a decent dessert.

Each time I drive by on weekends I notice hordes of people outside waiting to snag a table to chow down some amazing morning eats.However, my first time here I came for dinner. Even though BLD is mostly sought after for its breakfast, the lunch and dinner menus aren't to be over-looked. I showed up around 7pm on a Thursday night and almost every table was taken. Because it was a chilly night there wasn't anybody eating outside.We sat in the back corner at a nice two-person table. To get things rolling I ordered a beer to cozy up with while I looked over the menu. The dinner menu is pretty simple with some appetizers, burgers, pastas, sandwiches, and desserts. Right away there were two things that caught my eye; the smoked cajun mac & cheese and the spicy grilled shrimp (with Anson Mills goat cheese polenta, pancetta, tomato cont, and baby spinach).The mac and cheese came in a small skillet with tons of breadcrumbs sprinkled on top. Once I broke through the top layer I got to the ooey, gooey goodness of the mac & cheese. Because it was cajun it had a perfectly small kick of spice that wasn't overpowering.The spicy grilled shrimp dish only had a few shrimp but because it came with plenty of other amazing ingredients to round out the entree I didn't mind too much. The shrimp were big and juicy and also had a small spicy kick to them. The goat cheese was definitely the best part though. Goat cheese is one of my all-time favorite foods and this Anson Mills cheese surely did not upset. Plus, to make things better the dish came with a TON of it!After these two plates I was pretty full.

I've been here time and time again and the food has always been delicious whereas the service has always been abysmal. However, the food more than makes up for the service; still, come prepared to wait at least 30 minutes if not an hour for your food to come out! BLD also doesn't take reservations for parties of less than 5 so depending on what time you come, you'll have to wait for a table too. But trust me--the food is worth the wait! Brunch is my favorite meal of the day, and of that eggs are my favorite dish. Scrambled eggs, omelets, eggs benedict, you name it. But the winner here is the fried egg sandwich. The first time I came, I decided not to go with Yelp and ordered the steak eggs benedict whereas my friends got the egg sandwich and blueberry ricotta pancakes.Now, the pancakes here are probably the best I've ever had. They beat the red and blue velvet pancakes at Larchmont Bungalow, and are no contest for the pancakes at Griddle Cafe, which is a quantity-over-quality place. The ricotta lends it a uniquely creamy texture and the flavor is incredibly delicious without being too sweet. Chocolate chip pancakes are my favorite, and I have had some great chocolate chip pancakes, but the blueberry ricotta pancakes here are seriously the best I've ever had. The maple syrup container is also really cute too!So the steak benedict was pretty good, but man--I tried some of my friend's egg sandwich and immediately regretted my decision. It seems very simple, runny eggs, gruyere, bacon, aioli.. but all the ingredients are fresh and delicious as well as perfectly proportioned and it comes together in a mouth watering, mind blowing, heart attack inducing combination. I've been here a few times after that and have always ordered the egg sandwich. And I will not share my egg sandwich. I usually get chorizo home fries as my side and those are always delicious as well. The addition of chorizo is a great touch.Prices are reasonable as portions are pretty sizable.Ambiance is really nice and BLD is great for people watching. However, you often have to spend maybe 10 minutes trying to flag a waiter down to get what you want, and you'll probably have to ask multiple people before they finally get it for you. As mentioned before, the wait for everything will be at LEAST an hour until you finally get your food, and most likely an hour after you finish your food and finally get your check back. So don't come TOO hungry or in a rush. Then get the fried egg sandwich and blueberry pancakes, and have a great time.

Came here on a Sunday with my friend. They don't take reservations so when we got here at noon.. there was a wait... actually thats an understatement.. uhh.. this PLACE IS POPPIN!! WOW.. tons of people were already outside waiting and I was nervous in how long the wait will be as I arrived at the restaurant but the lady said it would be 25-30 minutes which isn't thaaaaat bad considering we got there at noon. There were seating outside the restaurant which is great on a nice sunny day and quite a few tables inside. My friend and I wanted to get seated at the first available so we were seated outside which was nice. Service was still available and attentive even though we were outside which I think its really important and something I do take notice. Classic Benedict- The classic benedict was prepared very well and includes canadian bacon, house made english muffin, and hollandaise sauce. There is no fuss, no frills, no crazy deconstructed or creative approach to the benedict. The classic benedict is exactly what it is called and it is done well. Not the best benedict I've ever had but for what it is and what it is meant to be, it was good. The hollandaise sauce was savory and not in a super yolky side where its too rich. All the ingredients complimented well with each other and the dish is served with a choice of potatoes (fried or oven roasted) which I choose oven roasted and it was delicious. The potatoes were too oily and not too rich where you feel extremely heavy from the dish. Overall, you are not going to get a HUGE quantity here at BLD but the food will get you adequately full. Braised pork bendict- The benedict is filled with savory braised pork with perfectly poached eggs where you dig a knife into the egg and the yolk runs out. It is on top of grilled pain de mie and citrus hollandaise. The braised pork was tender and savory and will fill you meat lovers heart. The dish is also paired with your choice of potatoes as well.

I always try egg benedicts at brunch or breakfast places because it's my favorite breakfast dish. We both had the chorizo potatoes since everyone loved them so much. My benedict had redish purple sauce, since it was made with red wine. I should have expected it, but it still threw me a little off guard when it was brought out. Steak was cooked well and was very tender. Eggs were perfect, sauce was okay. It was a good benedict, but not the best one I've had. I'd give it about a seven out of ten. The potatoes were sooo good. Crusty and crunchy and soft on the inside. Seasoned so well and really yummy. :) You can't really taste the chorizo though and they literally give you three thin strips. You might as well just call them home fries and not mention the chorizo. What a tease. My friend said her sandwich was good, but it wasn't amazing. It was fresh and yummy. It was an egg sandwich. She said she would come back though to try the blueberry ricotta pancakes. Maybe I will too. Just to try those though.

Second, just like any popular brunch place, during the week the wait isn't so bad but be prepared to stare longingly at patrons' dishes while you wait for a table. On my first visit I was craving savory so had the salmon benedict, but I was only able to make this choice because my friend ordered the blueberry pancakes. Salmon benedict = fab. Blueberry pancakes = fab (and I'm not a big pancake person, but I realize if someone on TV says this is the best thing they ever ate, I need to try it once ;). The pancakes had a great combo of a seared crunch and fluffy inside, plus delish blueberries and whole bits of ricotta baked in. I wouldn't say these were the best pancakes I've ever had, but they were quite good, AND HUGE. Be warned these are not the types of pancakes you can order on the side. For breakfast I also had a fantastic whiskey fizz, super refreshing and tasty.Now, I liked BLD so much, I recommended it the next day for brunch with another group of friends. This was despite the fact that I had weird stomach pains from the first visit which I had decided to just dismiss away. On the second visit, service was slightly slower. There was also a bug in my blood mary, however they gracefully did not charge me for my replacement drink (another whiskey fizz). I got the steak and eggs this time (feeling meaty) and gobbled it whole. One of my friends ordered the braised pork frittata, of which I thought the pork was divine.

Similarly, I am also leary of those so-called cooking shows where they take a carefully selected piece of prime beef, grill it and slather it in steak sauce and marvel about how good they are at cooking. How hard is that? Meat is intrinsically delicious... but it will kill you and has, after all, already taken one innocent life. But that's not even really my point I - am really NOT trying to convert you folks into vegetarians - I really just wonder why people call food like this \"great cuisine\" when it's really just a slab of lightly-grilled flesh - how hard is that? So, the thing is, when veggie like myself (yes - that's right!) goes to one of these so-called \"fabulous\" restaurants expecting good fare, we end up eating the greens and sides that really take some skill AND IMAGINATION to prepare well. Frequently, on such occasions, the cracks in such a \"fabulous\" begin to show and, without the how-can-you-go-wrong-with-with-a-slab-of-bloody-\u00adsirloin, the food is often bland and boring.So at BLD, being a vegetarian , I went for the overpriced ($15) and only mediocre veggie burger with albeit huge and delicious pile of french fries (fried stuff is also always sure-fire delicious too - although, it too will also kill you).

have loads of good memories from when this location used to be the home to RED. \u00a0It gave the area a casual dining spot that had a few really good dishes, and a good vibe for a meal. \u00a0So I came into BLD with some of that old karma feel. \u00a0Right off the bat, I liked the direction of the menu. \u00a0As others have posted, it's a deep menu that makes the rounds of a number of different food options...soup...salad...pressed sandwiches...burgers...pasta...and a bunch of breakfast standards. \u00a0I also appreciated a few interesting twists on the familiar. \u00a0Pork Burger and Short Rib sandwich to name a few. \u00a0While nice, the place may be a little stuffy for this neighborhood and our penchant for super casual breakfast or a lunch dining. \u00a0It sort of has a feel of eating at a Beverly Hills area hotel restaurant, not exactly the kind of place I would feel comfortable taking my Sunday NY Times and peeling through sections over a ton of coffee. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is really sharp looking. \u00a0Great for a business lunch. \u00a0Yet it doesn't feel as casual as say, Toast or Doughboys on Third. \u00a0That's why I don't think this will ultimately be the kind of restaurant that has the traffic and lines of those other two. \u00a0Anyway, back to the food. \u00a0I had a Caesar Salad that was a bit on the overdressed side...seemed a little rushed in prep perhaps, but still a generous \"small\" salad that ran about seven bucks.I also tried, at the suggestion of my waitress, the pork burger. \u00a0It comes with fries that are cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. \u00a0Also comes with a house made pickle that wasn't too bad. \u00a0The burger itself sported a really nice cheddar, the kind most places won't bother to serve. \u00a0It also had fresh lettuce and tomato. \u00a0The bun wasn't as bad as one of the other posters suggested. \u00a0I hate when burgers come with hard-toasted buns that make biting into a burger impossible. \u00a0This bun was soft enough to not make a mess of the whole burger.I also have to give a shout out to Joanna (sp?), my waitress. \u00a0She was very helpful in guiding me through the menu and seemed as if she really cared that I ordered the right stuff and had a good experience. \u00a0I also saw her interacting with a table of four next to me and she made a huge effort to make those people feel welcome at the restaurant, including inviting them back for more meals there. \u00a0While I might expect that when it's a table of four flirty guys playing the dating game with a cute waitress, this table was filled with folks old enough to be her parents...which made me think this restaurant is making a real effort to be part of the neighborhood. \u00a0Anyway, I normally don't see much to compliment when it comes to the performance of the wait staff, but Joanna deserves the mention. \u00a0I'm going to have to try a few more meals here to have a better feel for whether

Freaking delicious.I compare the food here to my old favorite hangout the now closed Cafe du village on larchmont. The food and presentation here is almost identical. Cuisine is french, very clean, very tasty.Inside decor was modern and sophisticated. A tree with rocks sitting on the ledge in white. Fancy! Good place to impress a date although the only downside is there's nothing close by to walk to after a meal and parking is residential (permit parking on cetain days.)My breakfast was $14 a plate, which is roughly how much most of the dishes are here ($12-$26) I only had breakfast so I cant vouch for lunch or dinner but i will definitely be back.One thing I wanted to mention, I couldnt for the life of me figure out the name of this place even after seeing the sign outside. To me it looked like a spoon knife and a fork (bld) I had to Yelp my address to figure out the name of this place. This was kinda discouraging because it gave me the impression that this place is VERY expensive (it's pricey but reasonable for the quality.) Maybe a normal BLD on the door would be less scary?

The waiter took our orders and everything was fine. The food took a little longer than normal on a busy day, which is understandable, but that was okay it's definitely worth the wait! When the food finally came, I immediately spotted something odd with my Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict...there was a dark curly hair sitting on top of my poached egg swimming in hollandaise sauce. GROSS. OK, I get it. Hair happens, no big deal. I immediately told the busser (who brought the food out) and he went to correct the problem. While my stomach acids were digesting my innards, my friends and gf were eating their meals happily. No problem, I figured my reorder will be placed on the top priority list in the kitchen and I should have my food in 15 minutes. WRONG! It took another 40 minutes for the food to come out and that's after I repeatedly asked for the waiter to come to our table to give me an update. Our waiter was completely MIA for almost the entire dining experience.

Now, my friends know me as a person who never sends food back, even if it's poorly made. I also never like to complain even if the service is bad and I normally suck it up. I always tip, regardless of how poor the service is because I know these people live off of tips, but this was the worst dining experience I've ever had in a long time. I understand mistakes happen, but rudeness on top of that and bland apologies just make things worse. Overall, the food was still good however the service and experience spoiled the meal. In the end, the manager comped my portion of the bill, but not without giving an attitude first. I would've given this place 4-5 stars, but it gets 2 for now. Will I still go back?

Wish we had ordered more of this.We also ordered two other entrees to share and should have just ordered one. The portions were enormous. They split our smoked salmon scramble onto two plates, and each half was the size of a normal portion. The scramble was good and the biscuit was decent. The chorizo potatoes were okay except I didn't taste the chorizo flavor at all. I actually forgot they were chorizo and thought they were regular home fries. Our eggs florentine was served in a small cast iron pot with creamed spinach, sliced rounds of fingerling potatoes, all drowning in their piquillo pepper hollandaise. Two toasted english muffins came alongside for you to top with the eggs. It was fun to make our own but the pot of eggs was super rich because they were just swimming in that hollandaise.

The lamb burger did not taste properly seasoned and it was a bit dry. It's understandable that lamb is a difficult meat to cook and can be extremely gamy-- which is why a lot of places DON'T serve lamb.

The texture of the french toast was average. The only thing I really liked was probably the maple syrup jar. It looked like a little Christmas house. Too adorable.The flatiron steak was nicely done. It was cooked to perfect temperature and super tender for this cut. The pork sandwich was quite spicy and flavorful. The skinny fries that came with it was crisp and fresh.This breakfast affair was rather ordinary. They have very good french press coffee though. Crepes are prepared at the counter by the open bar.

The ricotta added into the batter definitely makes these hot cakes moist and creamy. \u00a0As an added bonus, I found these particular pancakes a little less sweet than your typical pancake (so when I spread them with salty butter and warm maple syrup I got that magical combination of salty and sweet), and this maple syrup was no ordinary syrup! I would gladly take up residency in the little log cabin maple syrup house it is served in. \u00a0It was truly a viscous treat, and I would have loved nothing better than to drink it directly from the syrup spout. The blueberries were perfection, and the warm tart little capsules burst in your mouth and add the perfect fruity compliment to these delightful fluffy discs!So remember the next time you are in Los Angeles and craving something similar to vittles, supper, breakfast, brunch, chow, dessert, din-din, dinner, eats, fare, feast, feed, grub, lunch, luncheon, mess, munchies, picnic, potluck, refection, refreshment, regalement,repast, snack, spread, tea, or even a banquet. \u00a0I would suggest you look for one of the above options at BLD.thecupboardmouse.wordpre\u2026", "Date": "2009-08-28", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Vincent R.", "ReviewID": "AnR4BXvn8vq-hqKqLKtGPA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have nothing bad to say about this place.

I might actually go out on a limb here and say that these are the best topping-free fries I've ever had. Just the right amount of seasoning, thin cut, fried to crispy perfection. Fries can make or a break a meal, and these REALLY started me off on the right foot. It might even be what allowed me to forgive the fact that their chicken club sandwich only had two slices of bread, making it more of just a chicken sandwich than an actual club. Or maybe it was the fact that the sandwich was damn delicious. When the woman took half my sandwich and replaced it with half of her fried egg sandwich, I was about to bite her hand off. \"I don't need a sandwich with egg in it, that's just silly.\", I thought to myself. And again, I shut up as soon as I took a bite. Despite the name, there was actual meat inside the sandwich. Thick slices of pastrami-like bacon. Delicious. Even better than my faux club. And dripping with yolk, which is disgusting in a good, manly way. Her potato fingerlings were also excellent. I still don't even know what a potato fingerling is, but it makes me simultaneously hungry, happy, and a little aroused just thinking about it.All said and done, you'll spend twice as much here as you would at, say, Denny's on a Sunday morning. But you'll also get twice as much food, be twice as satisfied, be treated twice as nice, and generally feel twice as good. Is it worth four times the wait?

For $6, they gave us two tiny slices but a small mound of Spanish almonds, some quince, bread (both wheat sourdough and a denser white bread) and a few slices of apple. The mussels were fantastic with garlic, tomato and luscious red bell pepper.Unfortunately, one of my friends didn't think much of her \"constructive dinner\" of salmon, parsnips, mushrooms and french fries. And another hated his turkey burger. At least the third friend liked her ham and cheese sandwich.Then we all ordered desserts. I had the brownie. One friend ordered the magic bar and didn't like it though the consensus of the others was it was good. I didn't try it as I don't like dried shredded coconut. The house-made coffee ice cream was the better of the two ice creams ordered. The chocolate was okay. But again, portions are \"small.\" My friends complained about the price versus the portion. Well, I suppose you can buy a gallon for the same price but this is a restaurant, there's a mark-up. Actually, I think my whole meal was fairly reasonable. \u00a0I would love to try its sister restaurant, Grace (though I don't relish the even heftier price tag).Service is very slow though. Although, I never felt like we had to wait for things like water refills or getting our food boxed up since the bussers were on it more than our server. There was just a definite lag between ordering, getting our appetizers, our entrees and finally dessert. We were there for almost three hours.I like the space of the restaurant though when we first walked in, it was very noisy. The noise levels got better as the restaurant emptied out (we were seated at almost 10 p.m. after about a 20 minute wait-- we didn't have reservations). I'd like to try the Caesar salad or the hemp seed studded tofu salad next time.

A perk of BLD is they were still serving breakfast at 2 pm so my breakfast-loving self took over and I ended up going with the braised pork and poached eggs. They came perched on top of two pieces of toast with a bit of honey on it (I think, there was a sweet/ tangy taste to the dish and I couldn't quite place where it came from). The pork was well-cooked, easy to eat, and the poached eggs complemented them well. And even though I'm usually a big fan of toast, the toast the dish came with was too thick and was a weebit hard to eat - not a fan! What I was a fan of was their olive oil roasted potatoes. Delish! I wanted to get a mocha and when I asked the waiter (who I think MAY have been the manager?) what kind of coffee drinks they offered, he said, \"what?\" I think this exchange could've been made better with a drinks menu. Given that they have an espresso machine the size of California, one would think they would let their customers know what different types of drinks they offer. Just. a. thought.

We tried 4 of the cheese, bluecheese from oregon)i forget the name, manchego, camembert, and another one which was served on a spoon and was the mildest. The meats and cheese we ordered came artfully displayed on a large rectangular square with toasted white bread and date nute bread, along with fig and nuts. Amazing.When it was time to order entrees, i selected the flat iron steak, in a red wine sauce, and opted for the fingerling potatoes and garlic rapini as my 2 sides.

Nonetheless, the egg and cheese do go well with the toasted sourdough.

The bill came to 35 before tip, a bit expensive but well worth it.", "Date": "2011-02-21", "Author_Location": "Moorpark, CA"}, {"Author": "Alex C.", "ReviewID": "EN6eZG2IRIlJnhHbtnuLUg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Today's installment of \"The Best Thing (They) Ever Ate\" will focus on BLD's Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes. \u00a0Featured in the \"Wake Up Call\" episode in Season 1 of The Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" television show, BLD is a California style caf\u00e9 restaurant located in an upscale neighborhood in Los Angeles. \u00a0I have been to the restaurant on two different occasions; the last being well over a year ago, so hopefully my impressions of the restaurant won't be too outdated.The Menu: BLD's menu features fairly basic American cuisine such as salads, sandwiches, burgers, and a few pasta dishes. \u00a0The last time I visited the restaurant, I don't recall them having breakfast items on their menu, but I believe they have added quite a few breakfast items (as well as some new lunch and dinner items as well) since then. \u00a0Grade: BThe Food: For most people, cheese isn't the first ingredient that comes to mind when they're thinking about blueberry pancakes; and to our surprise, the Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes weren't nearly as exotic tasting as we expected them to be. \u00a0If someone were to give you a bite of these pancakes without telling you what was in them, you'd never think that ricotta cheese was an ingredient. \u00a0The pancakes were very moist (presumably due to the addition of ricotta cheese), but not overly dense or heavy. \u00a0Sure, they were very good blueberry pancakes (perhaps some of the best pancakes outside of The Griddle Caf\u00e9), but at the end of the day, they tasted like... blueberry pancakes. \u00a0In addition to the pancakes, we also ordered a Grilled Turkey Burger. \u00a0While the burger was fairly tasty, it was pretty much the same run-of-the-mill turkey burger you can get at most restaurants. \u00a0Grade: AThe Price: Meals at BLD generally run in the $10-$20 range per entr\u00e9e. \u00a0The pancakes were just a bit under $15 and the burger was just a bit over $15. \u00a0Not exactly cheap, but not outrageously expensive either - pretty standard for the area. \u00a0Grade: B-The Atmosphere: BLD is contemporarily styled and a bit minimalistic. \u00a0Everything, from the d\u00e9cor to the wait staff uniforms, appeared simple and clean. \u00a0The interior dining area probably seats about 30 people inside and is surrounded by large doors and windows making the area very bright and airy. \u00a0Outside, a few tables ring the front of the building. \u00a0Grade: CThe Other Stuff: As you would expect for most restaurants in upscale Los Angeles, the service was very attentive and efficient. \u00a0We had no issues ordering, getting refills on drinks, and the food came out fairly quickly. \u00a0 Also as you would expect for most caf\u00e9 style restaurants in Los Angeles - especially one located on Beverly Boulevard, BLD lacks their own dedicated parking. \u00a0Thus, patrons are relegated to hunting for metered street parking. \u00a0Since we were there for lunch, we didn't have any issue finding parking, but would imagine that wouldn't be the case during peak dinner hours. \u00a0Grade: BThe Verdict: I am a little torn about my opinion of the Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes. \u00a0On my first visit, I shared the dish (and the burger) with my girlfriend and we both LOVED the pancakes. \u00a0But on my second visit, I ordered the Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes by myself and the dish lost its appeal about half way through the meal. \u00a0Perhaps it's simply one of those dishes that you can't eat too much of at one sitting. \u00a0Or maybe the savory burger offset the sweetness of the pancakes during our first visit. \u00a0Personally, the Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes weren't \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" (they weren't even the best pancakes I ever ate - The Griddle Caf\u00e9 has better pancakes), but definitely worth of a try. \u00a0Grade: B-", "Date": "2011-06-30", "Author_Location": "Long Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Shawn K.", "ReviewID": "XIFmiqGgVYMvti-uV-suww", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came here for dinela for dinner.Pros:Friendly serviceCons:Valet is expensive and they try and trick you so becareful!

And finally the food -- oh, the food... I had two versions of the fritata on each visits and they rocked my world (the first time it was the meat lovers.. the second time it was the one with the prosciutto-wrapped-asparagus). And the potatoes were heavenly. And so were the fresh baked brioche. And the fresh, French press coffee. The only *good* problem I had with the food was that there was too much of it! Don't get me wrong -- I am an omnivore \u00a0-- but those fritatas took me down like Rocky did Clubber Lang in Rocky III. It all worked for me.

After placing our order, the friendly waitress immediately brought two glasses of complimentary champagne. \u00a0Original price $8/glass, the bubbling champagne was sweet and crisp, quite good.BF had the tuna tartare for appetizer. \u00a0Tuna was chopped into bite size chunks and mixed with some crunchy veggies. \u00a0The smoked paprika aioli was tasty. \u00a0Potato gaufrette was a bit salty, and a bit soggy. \u00a0BF compared this dish to the yellowtail appetizer dish we had at Grace. \u00a0He thought Grace's raw fish was better, and I agreed. \u00a0The food at Grace is more like a sophisticated elegant lady, while the food at BLD is more like a young urban guy. \u00a0I mean, they are both good, but just different style.I picked the wild boar sausage as my appetizer. \u00a0I am drooling now just thinking about this dish. \u00a0The wild boar sausage was wrapped in sweet puff pastry, kinda like a pig in a blanket. \u00a0The sausage was more on the heavy side. \u00a0But the pastry, along with the lightness of the polenta and sweet berry sauce, everything was just in the right balance. \u00a0I LOVE this dish. \u00a0Too bad it's not on their regular menu. \u00a0I'd definitely go back and order this again.We ordered a meat dish and a fish dish as our main entrees. \u00a0The Pinot Noir was suggested with the fish, but it went well with the meat as well. \u00a0BF didn't like this red wine, but I thought it was good. \u00a0But wine is not exactly my expertise. \u00a0I'm just a typical girl. \u00a0So as long as it's sweet, then I like it. \u00a0haha....Main entree had surprisingly large portion. \u00a0The seabass was moist and tasted very delicate. \u00a0The cauliflower curry sauce was pretty light, only had a hint of curry, and went very well with the fish. \u00a0It was a simple and good dish.I had the seabass first and thought it was good. \u00a0Then I had the braised beef short rib, and thought it was even better. \u00a0The rib was probably braised for a long time because it was super soft and tender. \u00a0Potato, spinach, pearl onion, beef jus, and the super delicious walnut horseradish creme. \u00a0This dish had a lot of things going on, but everything complimented each other so well. \u00a0This was the star of the night. \u00a0We were too full to finish the food and had to take half home. \u00a0The short rib was just as good the next day.BF got coffee to get ready for desserts. \u00a0You get a whole jar of strong and good French pressed coffee. We all know Grace has the best dessert, so I was expecting the same level here. \u00a0Sorry to say, dessert was a big big disappointment at BLD. \u00a0The first dessert we had was peanut butter chocolate chip bread pudding. \u00a0I took a big bite, and almost spit it out right away. \u00a0The dessert was SALTY. \u00a0Not just a little salty, but VERY SALTY. \u00a0Ok, so I wasn't exactly expecting a salty dessert. \u00a0Well, let's try the ice cream then. \u00a0Ice cream can't be bad, right? \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0Another big bite, almost spit it out AGAIN. \u00a0Yes, the caramel ice cream was also salty, VERY SALTY. \u00a0I tried to have a few more bites, so did BF. \u00a0We really tried. \u00a0But no, we left most of it untouched.The sweet potato pecan tart was much better. \u00a0Well, everything should taste better than really salty bread pudding and really salty ice cream. \u00a0But it just couldn't compare to the dessert at Grace. \u00a0I do like the crunchy oat ice cream a lot. \u00a0But dessert definitely is not BLD's thing.We love the food at BLD. \u00a0Since breakfast is BF's favorite meal of the day, we would like to come back again to try some of their morning food.

The waiter came by and told me that they had turned down the AC and it should be warming up soon. I never told them I was cold, yet they took the liberty in adjusting the temp for me. So great!Now, onto the foood! I had the prix fixe menu, which came to be $25 for dinner. That's pretty damn good if you ask me, especially for a 4-star restaurant on Yelp. For appetizer, I got the heirloom tomato salad. I really liked the grilled corn that came with it. It provided a taste that really emphasized the flavor of the dish. My friends got the beef carpaccio, which was also pretty good. I'm not particularly a meat lover, but I had a couple of tastes of this, and it was pretty good. For the entree, I got the seared yellowtail over tomato couscous. This was the highlight of the meal for me. The semi-cooked yellowtail created a tender, juicy texture that paired well with the soft couscous. I remember saying that I didn't want to finish the dish just so that I would have more of it later. The flavor of everything was perfectly paired and really came together as a great dish.For the dessert, my friends and I shared two mixed berry tarts and one salted caramel sundae. The mixed berry tart was divine; it was fresh and light. Came with blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries. It tasted kind of like a cheesecake almost, but lighter, which I loved. It was an excellent ratio to the salted caramel sundae. This was heavier and more sweet. If you are a salted caramel fan, this went perfectly with the brownie that came with it.

Maybe it is my mistake for going to a place that specializes in breakfast and brunch for dinner (loved Grace btw). I did experience something I've never experienced in a finer dining establishment but it was not of the positive variety. We started off with the fried green tomatoes and the duck rillette with fig jam and cornichons. The rillette was more meaty than creamy but went very well with the excellent sweet, dark, slightly tarty fig jam. Delicious combo. If I wanted salty and savory I went with the corichons instead. The fried green tomatoes had a hard crunchy shell that reminded me of cornmeal. While I get that it provides texture contrast to the tomato, it was hard enough I couldn't even get my fork through it easy. The Parmesan fondue sauce was very light. I didn't taste Parmesan at all. It tasted just like cream to me. Overall mundane. For the entree I got the pork chops with bacon and my friend had the scallops with corn risotto and tomato sauce. The scallops were a little overcooked but the acidity of the tomato sauce with the corn risotto and scallops were very good, giving scallops a darker earthier taste which made them more savory. The pork chop I had were pretty disappointing. It had a fancy apple au jus reduction which I really didn't taste any of the apple at all. The pork was also way too salty and due to that didn't really need the bacon. The creamy pollentas it came with were good, but nothing special. The biggest shocker was that there were certain parts that were BURNT. I had to flip it over to see why it tasted so smokey on some bites which is when I noticed some char marks of the edges that confirmed what I tasted. Sorry I've never had burnt food in a higher end dining establishment till now. The cooked slaw that it came with was also a little burnt. I didn't finish it. If we weren't in a rush to get to a movie, I would have had a discussion with our waiter. Also had the brownie sunday for dessert. The mocha ice cream had lots of ice bits in it and was not of great quality. Brownie was a bit undercooked so it was mushy. The bit of coffee grinds gave it a little kick. Very unremarkable overall though. This place for dinner is highly overrated but I do give it to them for trying some bolder flavors. But please learn to cook first, there wasn't even pressure of a busy service since we were there 5:30 and only a few tables seated. The Korean movie we saw with a director Q&A afterwards was the highlight of the night.

Waitress was pretty quick to try and take our order but once our food came, service started to get lousy. Took them awhile to bring us boxes for our food and our check, but so quick to get the payment. Service knocks off a star. Food on the other note, was amazingly delish. There were 6 of us with different platters and all was good. I ordered the flatiron steak and eggs with chorizo potatoes. Mouth started to water once my plate was brought out. You could totally smell the goodness of the steak. Mmmm mm mmm juicy! Wish the steak could of been a little bigger since my 5 year old kept asking me to cut him a piece. Chorizo potatoes were delish but my sister's olive oil potatoes were even better. I'll probablyorder the olive oil roasted potatoes for myself next time. My son didn't get to finish his baked french toast b/c he was busy chomping on my steak so I decided to try it out. OMG! BOMBDOTCOM!!!! It had bacon and cream cheese inside this perfectly made softest, fluffiest french toast served with pure maple syrup. Totally hit the spot for my sweet tooth, dessert craving. YUMMMM! Perfect combination of sweetness with that slight saltiness from the bits of bacon. Cream cheese gave it that good squishy, moist texture. Orange juice was fresh. Love, love, love this place.

It was definitly not the prettiest plate ever, but the potatoes were searingly hot, and the bacon was right under them, spreading that wonderful bacon fat around the bottom of the plate. the egg was placed on top of all that.

Do not come here if you are claustrophobic.Service - This is the main reason of the \"Eek! Methinks not\" 1 star review. It started well, with a text to let us know when we had seats available. While ordering we quickly noticed our waitress had an attitude which made the experience uncomfortable (maybe she was having a bad day?) still this shouldn't be taken out on the customers. We ordered our food, and patiently waited. 20 minutes has gone by and the waitress stops by and brings a large french press coffee (which we didn't order), and says \"sorry about the wait your food will be here soon\". We thought \"cool, complementary coffee for the wait?\". we were mixed about the service at this point, and our food gets to the table maybe 15 minutes later. The service seemed attentive, refilling our waters as needed, until something mysterious happens. I don't know if our waitress was abducted by aliens, or if they were having an easter egg hunt in the kitchen, but our service literally VANISHED for half an hour.

Overpriced for what you get. We had the pulled pork and butterfield benedict. The eggs were cooked well, but the pork was overly sour. The vinegar pretty much overpowered everything else on the plate. The butterfield, which is a sliced flat iron steak benedict was cooked a perfect medium rare, but the red wine sauce that was waterfall'd on top was coyingly sweet.

The atmosphere of the restaurant sets a good tone for a date. It seems to get darker as the night progresses and the candles add a nice touch. We started off with the braised beef short rib, which is just oh so flavorful. We probably devoured it in like two minutes tops and probably not in the most graceful manner. For the entree, I had the BLD house beef burger and was honestly a little surprised at how good it was. The goat cheese paired very well with the beef for a rich creamy taste, that was different from most burgers I have had. Also the french fries were so good. If you get a burger, definitely get the french fries instead of salad. Lastly, the service was really good too, but I expected that at a nice restaurant.THE BAD: Parking can be a bit rough depending on when you come.

It's what gays do. For a while now I've been hearing of the wonders of BLD in WeHo. I finally had an occasion to visit with my friend Meg and her father who graciously treated us. The decor is very typical WeHo - polished, modern, yet with some nice homey touches. I was particularly tickled by a display of little mini stoves from days gone by on one of the walls.The restaurant boasts a traditional brunch menu with a modern flare. Benedicts, egg sandwiches, burgers, salads - all with twists that either up the ante or make them quintessentially Calfornian. For example their breakfast sandwich comes on fresh toasted sourdough, gruyere cheese and aioli - not what you find at Dunkin Donuts. Or how about a vegan benedict? Please. What stood out to me was their entirely homemade breads and baked goods. Everything made on the premises, down to the english muffins. These people are not messing around. And believe me, the starving artist really appreciates restaurants (and men) that don't mess around. I went for one of the specials, which was an heirloom tomato frittata topped with pesto, served with a choice of potato and bread. I ended up with both a biscuit and an english muffin (I'm not ashamed) as well as their chorizo homefries. Really outstanding. And one of the best biscuits I've had in a long time.More good news: their service matched their food - very friendly, very professional. Our waitress messed up Meg's order and put in the wrong dish. Meg didn't really mind that much as she was happy with the food that they did bring her, but the waitress was still very apologetic and took her meal off the bill. That's how you keep customers happy.As for pricing, if you're looking to spend less than $10 this will not be the place for you, but I still think it is very reasonable considering it's brunch in WeHo.Verdict: highly recommended for a brunch that's classier than a diner, but still pleasant and accessible.

The ambiance was pretty nice. It was very dimly lit candles (that appeared mid-meal, as they were not prepared), and a good distance between the tables. Steamed mussels were good. They were perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned and the crusty bread was delicious with the salty cooking liquid. Spanish Tuna Tartare was bad. It was extremely salty and... too much paprika.

The gnocchi that comes along with it was flavorful. It had a nice chewy texture that one expects in a great gnocchi. I would've much rather had a plate of that.The braised short ribs were good. The grits complimented the sauce of the short ribs very well. The dish melded together nicely. The spicy arugula balanced the richness of the dish.

People setting the table should really pay more attention as this can gross a lot of people out before even ordering their food. Anyways, please note that none of the people in my party are picky eaters when it comes to ordering. However, some of my friends have religious/personal restrictions when it comes to meat. That was the case with one of the girls in our party. The waiter comes around & takes our order. My friend ordered the eggs your way plate but when it came to the potatoes & the dish all she requested was \"no meat\" & that was all - simple right? About 5 minutes or so later, the waiter comes around with my coffee (French pressed as default & delicious!) & an order of some ham and cheese croissants (we ordered 3 for $11 & I highly recommend these!). But, I pretty much finished my entire press of coffee & waited another 20 minutes after that (definitely more than 30 mins from time of ordering) before we saw any other food. So the food is finally coming out & a few servers are helping out pass around the dishes. Sadly, the waiters had no idea what was what. They were pretty confused with the orders - but we tried to let it go given we were starving & had waited so long for our food. They handed my \"no meat\" friend her plate & when she asked if they were sure it had no meat, the waiter said he better go back & check. So the waiter comes back & we noticed he switched the potatoes to the ones WITH meat in them!!?! Umm, what? Long story short, the \"manager\" (an unprofessional person who was also playing hostess) comes over after my friend is now pretty upset & tried to say that my fiend asked for the meat & that the waiter was not at fault. All she ever requested was no meat! It's not rocket science. Especially after taking forever with our food, they still make us feel like we're a nuisance to the place & blame my friend for the \"miscommunication\" - just wrong. An hour after initially ordering, she gets a new plate, which was boxed up & eventually given to a homeless guy. Our party tried to make the best of the situation considering we were celebrating a birthday, but this place clearly shouldn't accept large reservations.

They had a great variety of dishes and it all sounded really good that it was slightly difficult deciding what to get. I finally settled on the HOUSE CURED SALMON which consisted of a mixture of scrambled eggs, salmon bits, red onions, chives, cream cheese, and fried capers. It was good as they cut the salmon into teeny tiny chunks and mixed it in the scramble. Thankfully, the salmon wasn't as salty as I thought it would be which is good by my book. With this plate you also have a choice of a bread and potatoes. I opted for the house made cream cheese & chive biscuit as my bread choice and the olive oil & thyme roasted fingerling potatoes. They were both delicious! The biscuit was fluffy and light and the potatoes were tasty and not overly cooked. The restaurant was filled with what seemed like locals as everyone had the Industry attire of jeans and either a sweater, a hoodie or a gas station attendant jacket as I like to call it. I guess that's to be expected being so close to Tinseltown. Our server was a really sweet girl, with a great smile and friendly demeanor. Definitely not diner-style wait staff as BLD attendants are obviously coached to be courteous and polite which is a big plus in my book. I enjoyed my meal here and definitely would come back again.

The service was painful. Our server was just flighty to the point of space cadet. Not sure if she was new but at that point I didn't even care. I waited table for 10 years and let me tell you it wasn't rocket science. Step save and you will succeed.The first sign of painfulness was after waiting 20+ minutes for our table (which IS completely acceptable for Sunday Brunch) we sat at our table without water or being greeted by anyone who worked there for a good 10-12 minutes. She finally arrived and we were of course READY so while she was there we gave her our full order. She looked completely perplexed when we asked to start off with the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes for the table to share. She then told us that the griddle is backed up and it would take upwards to 20 minutes or so for the pancakes. No problem, we will start with the Nutella Banana Crepe then and bring the pancakes out whenever they are ready. We each ordered our mains and she said she would be right back with our drinks. Still waiting for drinks 5 minutes later I noticed her delivering drinks to a table that she took the order after us. Hmm.... Finally she brought our drinks so this whole ordeal was another 12-15 minutes in total. So in about 25 minutes our first course finally made it's way to the table. It did so after the server that took our order of the crepe walked passed our table with the crepe, looked around to the two other tables near us (one done eating and one still with menus) and then realized it was ours. TARD! The whipped cream on the side of the crepe was completely melted. She replied with a chuckle \"It's melted but it's still really good\". WTF! I manage a restaurant that serves Sunday Brunch (one of our busiest days of the week) and there is no way my Chef would have sent out the food that way. And if one of my servers said that to a guest I would be so embarrassed. Crepe was delicious btw...While eating our crepe our server came out to tell us that they were out of the Chorizo Home Fries at the moment and that it would take 30 minutes for them to come out. This whole time she was looking at me while talking and I was the only person at the table who did not order the chorizo home fries. TARD again! Steve opted for the Rosemary Potatoes and Lucy said she would take the chorizo home fries whenever they were ready. The Pancake came out next and then mid pancake our main courses arrived. Talk about shoveling food down to make room. Pancake was good but like Steve said \"it was not Food Network worthy\". To our surprise, Lucy and Steve's main courses came out with the chorizo home fries. Great but now we were expecting something else. If our server took time to communicate with the kitchen she could have relayed the info to us the paying guests. Our meals were Delicious! So good it makes me so sad that the service here is so bad. I even gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought \"maybe they are short staff\". As I know when my restaurant is short staff weather it be FOH or BOH, it can make an already busy day seem impossible. I watched the \u00a0MOD walk back and forth between the openings that lead in and out of the kitchen. Never through our ridiculously drawn out brunch did he ever once circle the dining room. I finally decided that I wanted to find out if they were short staff or if that is \"just how it is there\" (service was lacking on my first dining experience as well) and the MOD confirmed that it was \"just how it is done there\". They were not short staff and he did not apologize but gave a \"thank you for bringing it to his attention\". Speaking with him made me take a step back in my management shoes and say \"oh god I hope I am not like that with customers\". Food is outstanding. Service is painful and the place is mismanaged.

beautiful restaurant with a really cool chef and wonderful food.Long story long:I'll admit, I might be a TINY bit biased on this review because well, this meal was totally free. \u00a0No, I don't know the chef (personally) nor am I directly affiliated with the restaurant or have a close relative that works here. \u00a0I won a contest and the reward was a free meal. \u00a0Yes, it's just that simple.Let me elaborate a little bit. \u00a0For those of you who don't know, BLD is the sister restaurant of Chef Neal Fraser's Grace, which used to be just a block away but shuttered in June of 2010 and will soon reopen in what I hear is a beautiful and historical space in Downtown. \u00a0Think of BLD as the younger, nerdier, but still a little cool, sister. \u00a0Fraser is probably rarely in the house, so the kitchen is left in the hands of Chef de Cuisine, Diana Stavaridis. \u00a0For me as an active Twitter user, we actually follow each other, and Chef D, as she sometimes calls herself, has a weekly contest which she calls \"Tweet a dish\", in which she encourages her followers to suggest an entree for their plate du jour on Thursdays. \u00a0She usually cuts off the contest on Sundays and announces a winner on Wednesday, typically tweeting the winning Tweeter and asking him or her to call the restaurant to make a reservation for them and a guest for a complimentary meal.My winning dish was grilled NY strip with sweet potato puree, wild mushrooms, and a red wine reduction. \u00a0I think Chef Diana rarely takes the dish as is and always puts her own spin on it. \u00a0Instead of my dish, she decided to make filet of beef with sweet potato gratin, wild mushrooms, and cabernet sauvignon sauce. \u00a0I called to make my reservation and after a short search, Veronica R volunteered to join me. \u00a0I actually had somewhere to be, so I made my reservation a little later than I would have preferred, but it still all worked out.The restaurant and its decor is pretty simple but clean. \u00a0There isn't much going on, which given that this is a little more casual than its big sister, Grace, is actually okay and befitting. \u00a0I actually like that the exterior wall facing the street is actually a series of large floor to ceiling window panels. \u00a0The lighting must be gorgeous on a nice day.I arrived first and was lead to our table. \u00a0A few short minutes later, Veronica arrived and shortly thereafter, our server came by to give us our menus and beverage order. \u00a0We both ordered a glass of wine. \u00a0I was told the deal was that our appetizers, entrees, and dessert were to be comped, but I assumed everything else on top of that we had to pay for and I was prepared to pay for. \u00a0More on that later.For our appetizers, I ordered the albacore tuna tartare and Veronica ordered the cheese and charcuterie platter. \u00a0She had no preference and let the server choose an assortment. \u00a0We thought the server had good taste because her selections, we all liked. \u00a0My tuna tartare was alright. \u00a0Served with Japanese hot mustard aioli, cucumber, and crispy seaweed. \u00a0The fish was fresh, but the rice seemed like it had been refrigerated. \u00a0It was rather off putting and after about half of it, I ate just the fish and kinda poked at the rice a little. \u00a0The hot mustard aioli was nice and the seaweed was nothing too entirely special either, just seemed to have been put in the oven to draw out some extra moisture, but wasn't \"crispy\" like if maybe it was put in the deep fryer. \u00a0But that's just me.For the entrees, I of course had to order what was inspired by my idea. \u00a0Veronica ordered the seared albacore tuna, with couscous, pea tendrils, a jalapeno fennel cream and cilantro vinaigrette. \u00a0She liked it and I had a bite. \u00a0The tuna was fresh, and the entire dish had good flavor. \u00a0I liked my dish a lot better though, and not just because I had inspired it. \u00a0I ordered my filet medium rare, but it came out a little on the medium to medium well side. \u00a0I have a thing about sending food back, unless it's REALLY bad, so I didn't complain. \u00a0I really liked the sweet potato gratin. \u00a0The mild natural sweetness matched really well to the saltiness and richness of the gruyere cheese of the gratin. \u00a0I really liked that a lot and would make it at home. \u00a0It was nicely present in a small cast iron pot.For dessert, we knew we were going to share our desserts, so we decided on the pecan pie sundae and the banana cream pie. \u00a0The pecan pie sundae was probably our favorite of the 2, with oatmeal brown butter ice cream, creme fraiche caramel and bourbon praline. \u00a0The banana cream pie, while still good, with a brownie crust, whip cream, and fresh bananas, was pretty standard but didn't really stand out.Service was great and Chef Diana came out to chat for a little bit. \u00a0All in all, it was a wonderful dinner and I would definitely come back again. \u00a0This is one of thsoe places that is nice enough to bring a date, but casual enough to come with a small group of friends.", "Date": "2011-04-11",

Sara L. \u00a0Last Wednesday evening, the lovely, talented, and always up for a good meal Sara L. picked me up from the airport with her impeccable taste riding shotgun, just aching to go out for dinner. \u00a0As we drove around after a harrowing cross country trip that was by this time approximately 12 hours in the making, she and I ended up at BLD. \u00a0I was hungry and I was grumpy but I had a cheery little cherub for a dining companion and we were at a restaurant I had been dying to try (thanks, Yelp!). \u00a0Did I mention I was hungry? \u00a0Really, really hungry? \u00a0And did I mention I get astoundingly grumpy when I get hungry? \u00a0Well, I do. \u00a0So, all I wanted was some grub. \u00a0I was prepared to give a bad review based on our first half hour there. \u00a0Our waiter would not come over to us. \u00a0When he finally did, we ordered some wine (ok, *I* ordered some wine - the girl isn't a big drinker but that doesn't stop me). \u00a0I begged him for some bread. \u00a0The place was packed (on a Wednesday, mind you), it took him forever just to take our drink order, and I was stahhhhhhhrrrrving. \u00a0I couldn't wait to order, wait some more, and then eat. \u00a0I needed some sustinence ASAP. \u00a0He kind of looked at me as though I were incredibly gauche but agreed to bring me some sourdough and whole grain that they had lying around after he told me three different ways that he would be doing all of this himself. \u00a0Jeez - I get it. \u00a0You're going out of your way for me. \u00a0Much appreciated. \u00a0Well, perhaps he threw some love in the warmer with the bread because that bread was phenomenal. \u00a0And, it wasn't just my hunger because Sara L. was impressed, as well. \u00a0And, it held me over quite nicely. \u00a0Now is the time for ordering. \u00a0Sara L. returns from the restroom and declares that she knows my top three choices and if I don't order one of these, she doesn't actually know me at all. \u00a0*GASP* She's wrong! \u00a0How could this be??? \u00a0Her three choices are ALL WRONG. \u00a0When I tell her this she says, \"If you order the fucking turkey burger I will lose all respect.\" \u00a0*Gulp* \u00a0I tell her that I'm just *craving* a turkey burger and Sara L. explains that this is not where I fulfill my cravings for a turkey burger. \u00a0I concede that she is, in fact, correct and that it's the travel and the hunger that could lead me so astray and I thus, settle on her top choice for me. \u00a0All is right in the world, folks. \u00a0Sara L. actually does know me as we thought she did!!I had the self constructive dinner with the chicken, garlic rabe, and fries. \u00a0The rabe was overcooked and bland. \u00a0I would not get it again. \u00a0The fries were outstanding. \u00a0I wanted fries and Sara L. could only curb my cravings so much so fries I got. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0The chicken was excellent. \u00a0It was tender and juicy and beautifully deboned in a way that we both agreed we not skilled enough to do. \u00a0Sara L. got the same thing only instead of the fries she got the haricot verts, which she adorably avoided pronouncing. \u00a0: ) \u00a0The 'green beans' were good but also not great. \u00a0Perhaps veggies aren't their strong suit. \u00a0No matter! \u00a0We were perfectly content to eat fries and chicken and bread until we were full and happy. \u00a0And when all three are so tasty, how could you not be happy? \u00a0Ah - the sauce. \u00a0I ordered pesto, Sara L. ordered the garlic one. \u00a0The waiter, who by now had won me over, brought us both a container of each sauce so we could try them both. \u00a0And, I'm so glad he did! \u00a0The garlic one was WAY better. \u00a0I am a pesto lover but this pesto was way too oily and didn't hang

I still like the traditional french toast and so far, Du Par's in Studio City has one of the BEST french toast but I have to RAVE about the Ricotta Blueberry Pancake. I loved everything about it. The pancake was very silky and velvety. It was very moist and fluffy, not flat and rubbery. There were FRESH blueberries in the pancakes and the maple syrup was served warm.

Nope! Would I come back? Yes, but if that pancake is burnt again... I looove brunch!!! And there's nothing better than post-call brunch when you've managed to escape on time and are still awake enough to indulge in this necessary American tradition. Swarming with the usual LA faces-hipsters, hippies, and hipless skinnies, this place buzzed with the happy conversations of friends getting together over delicious culinary creations. I'm all about details and so there is little surprise that my favorite things about this place were the individual titanium coffee presses and the tres chic salt and pepper grinders. I think it's impossible to try to this place without having the much raved about ricotta blueberry pancakes, so if course we did. Fluffy, oversized, and impregnated with luscious juicy blueberries this carbohydrate sin would have been perfect except it was slightly burnt! Smokey bacon I can live with, but tar tasting smoky pancakes...yuck! Really don't need that carcinogen unless it'll mutate me into a cool x-men. It wasn't coal converting into diamonds, but I was certainly aching to send it back the bitterness was so prominent. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that this doesn't always happen because the other pancake my friend ate seemed fine. Also, unlike the photos there were hardly as many blueberries...Sorry but I need all the antioxidants I can get to counteract the cancer pancakes, no wonder they serve them burn side down, I mean upside down. However I must commend them for serving up real maple syrup which if you've travelled outside the westcoast is tragically a rarity compared to the rest of the country. Much appreciated and love the adorable containers! I don't think you've lived until you've had real maple syrup.Second was the salmon benedict with fingerling potatoes. Served on top of a perfectly toasted thick soft English mufffin that stood up well to the rich super citrusy hollandiase sauce and egg yolk, this was a nice change from those flimsy ones you usually get that disintegrate once moistened. The classic hollandaise sauce has \u00a0ratio of about 3 egg yolks, 1/2 lbs butter, tablespoon of lemon juice, and usually +/- a dash of cayanne or paprika. I have mixed feelings about how lemony the sauce was and how well it complemented the arugula and salmon, but I supppose \u00a0the acidity did help to cut the richness as intended and brighten up the dish. *Hollandaise is 1 of the 5 classic french sauces and differs from a Bernaise in that the acid component in the reduction is lemon rather than vinegar with tarragon.That's wonderful they cure their own smoked salmon, but I could barely appreciate the salmon flavor in my benedict. Perhaps add another slice for my omega 3's please? The arugula was a very nice touch (rich in Vitamin C and potassium btw) and the eggs were perfectly poached. The potatoes were a bit on the greasy side compared to the rest of the faire, but well seasoned and had a nice slight crisp to them. Service was friendly and polite. I think they do a great job getting everyone their food on time while it's warm, especially with such a large hungry crowd waiting to be fed. One of LA's trendy brunch spots ,I think this well designed menu should have something to please everyone.

Everything seemed to go just right as we had found street parking too. The atmosphere was very bright and warm, with a modern and clean feel. I like that a lot of natural light lit up the room, perfect for brunch on such a nice day.The menu was nicely divided into different sections depending on what you felt like and there were also a few specials to add more variety. Also, you know you're at a legit brunch/breakfast place when they have fresh squeezed juice. I ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice (they also had grapefruit and something else), which was quite refreshing and delightful.The serving sizes were actually quite large and I was pretty full at the end of the meal. I ordered the Ode to Butterfield's (thinly sliced flatiron steak, poached eggs, cabernet sauvignon hollandaise, house made english muffin, and spanish chorizo home fries). You have a choice of potatoes, so I decided to go with the chorizo home fries to see what all the reviews were talking about. They were good, but not addicting. It was nice to have that added crunch from the chorizo with the softness of the starch from the potatoes, but it felt a little heavy after awhile. I did enjoy the main part of the dish with all the elements blending together nicely, yet still possessing their own unique flavor. The steak was tender and cooked to a nice medium rare and the eggs were perfectly poached with that nice yolk just oozing out when you puncture it. I loved the cabernet sauvignon hollandaise because that wine flavor added the something special, which ended in quickly devouring the two eggs and muffins. In addition, the hollandaise didn't seem to heavy. When I was done with the eggs, I dipped my potatoes in the sauce. Finally, the home made english muffin was soft and moist. I hate it when english muffins are too dry or tough and make the dish too chewy. Thus, the steak, egg, muffin and hollandaise was a pleasant treat for my mouth.I'll definitely have to come back to try the blueberry ricotta pancakes when I'm in the mood and to try lunch and dinner here.", "Date": "2011-10-01", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "J.

Got seated pretty quickly with a crowd outside, and to my surprise, this place is rather modern and hipster-ish. I thought this place was known for breakfast & brunch so I expected the place to be more cute and decorated, but apparently people love their dinner just the same so it made sense that decor is pretty minimal and sleek. What kind of logic is this? Beats me, but the birthday girl is a fellow elite yelper so our party did our share of yelping around the table. What annoyed me was that you'd think they would restock everything for a Saturday brunch, but they were out of the andouille sausage and all types of croissants. I mean, yes you're known for pancakes and benedict, but you're aware you have a menu with other items?Coming in, I knew it was going to be down to two choices: blueberry ricotta pancakes or eggs florentine. I love blueberry and I love ricotta. I don't love pancakes, but if they're amazing, yes please! However, choosing means you must sacrifice one for the other, and since I've never been one to shy away from anything with poached eggs (especially if it's raved about), I went with the predictable choice. The eggs florentine comes in a deep round skillet layered with sausage and potatoes on the bottom, two poached eggs, and a ton of sauteed spinach on top. The hollandaise sauce had a kick to it, which paired very well with the potatoes and sausage. The spinach was a bit bland, but nothing some salt & pepper couldn't fix. The English muffins came on the side, and I wasn't exactly sure if you were supposed to put it together yourself or just eat everything separately. The muffins were toasted too long and came out hard and crunchy, so it didn't work well when put together. Kinda regretted not going for the pancakes at this point, but as curious as I am, I would have been back to try the eggs florentine at one point or another.My boyfriend's Spanish Scramble had good eggs, good sauce, but the chorizo was rather large clumps of dry meat. Definitely not the best meat for a scramble, or anything for that matter, but overall everything had pretty good flavor. I wish there was one dish I could love completely, but I could only enjoy parts of each.

However, the importance of the quality and preparation is a make or break detail when discussing or reviewing the pork in question. I prefer really, really thick bacon, while others prefer thin and crispy. BLD is absolutely of the thick variety.This last weekend, Elizabeth and I visited one of my favorite restaurants in LA; BLD Hollywood. The initials suggest that they are a great choice for all 3 of the important daily meals, but in my experience, while they're sufficient in all categories, breakfast is the area they excel in.It's weird when you remember an experience in your life fondly, even if the experience proved to be negative in retrospect. There was a period of a few months at the beginning of 2010, when I would go to BLD almost 5 days a week around 1030 in the morning, drink my coffee, stay for 2 hours and eat a ridiculously greasy meal including a fried egg sandwich, a strawberry and nutella crepe' and usually an extra side of bacon. I may have gained 15 pounds in 4 months and spent somewhere in the realm of $2,500 at BLD during that time (which I realize now sounds absurd), but for some reason when I think back on it, I can't do anything but get nostalgic. Maybe it was the bacon?The first thing i'm going to review today is the chocolate croissant at BLD. I can honestly say without a doubt, that it is the best one i've ever had. It's unlike any other croissant i've experienced, being less than half the size of the norm, perfectly flaky on the outside and so soft and delicious on the inside, you'd think they just pulled it out of the oven every time you taste it. It feels almost uncooked it's so soft, but it's chewy at the same time, so you can tell what your getting is just a rarely achieved piece of perfection rather than just warm, raw dough. I highly recommend the french press coffee from Allesandro's to go along with it if you like rich, strong coffee. Keep in mind, the croissant is only available Saturday and Sunday, and usually sells out by 11, so go between 930 and 1030 if you want to ingest a piece of the heavens.The fried egg sandwich at BLD is really quite magnificent. It's on a simple sourdough loaf with Nueske's thick cut bacon (and it is thick), some kind of delicious aioli, a ridiculous amount of Gruyere and one of the most perfectly prepared gooey fried eggs you'll ever have. These days, I choose to get my eggs scrambled, as i've had the sandwich so many times, but either way you do it, you'll be hard pressed to not have your mind blown with the sheer deliciousness of this greasy treat. You get your choice of sides, but there's really no question about which one is the correct choice. The \"chorizo home fries,\" which include several varieties of roasted potatoes, and a healthy amount of chorizo sausage sliced as thin as a dime are very unique in that they don't really feel like a side. Any time my breakfast dish includes a side that really feels like a bonus, it's a huge plus for the experience. I'm one of those people that has a hard time eating a small amount of something I love, as the experience is cheapened by the inevitability of it ending. This is why when going through late night drunk drive through's, I order 5 $1 items, rather than 1. Can't be avoided. Just the way i'm built. My lady ordered the brulee'd grapefruit. She ordered lighter, as she planned on sharing my dish with me. We agreed that the grapefruit was very solid, and definitely above average, but probably not something we'd order again. It was sweeter than a normal grapefruit, and the crusted sugar around the edges made for a great textural experience.The service at BLD is tough for me to review, because we've been going there for so long. They're never anything other than completely amazing in taking care of us, and i'm definitely biased, because they go out of their way to make us feel like VIP's each and every time.I'm out of room on yelp, but to read the end of the full review, check out the whole blog here; benjaminbateman.tumblr.c\u2026Overall: 7.4A strong showing overall, that could have been stronger.

I really wish they accepted reservations on the weekends like they normally do, just because you sometimes have to wait over an hour on a Sunday if you come here after 12pm. Service can be slow and a little lacking too when they are busy, even though the servers are always cordial.As for the food...I have actually been eating at BLD for over 5 years, beginning in high school before I moved to NYC. This is without a doubt one of my favorite places for brunch, both in LA and NYC, and I always make sure to visit whenever I am back in town. Brunch is my favorite meal in the world, and it can definitely be very difficult to choose between the many wonderful establishments in the area for weekend brunch... including Blu Jam, Taste on Melrose, Urth Caffe, Square One Dining, Alcove, Flore, Hugo's, Doughboys, just to name a few.. However I always find myself coming back to BLD.BLD's brunch menu is relatively limited, compared to some other restaurants. However, I believe that the few items that they do, they do extremely well. I agree with every other review that the blueberry ricotta pancakes are heavenly, impossibly light and tender with the perfect bits of tartness. The little tin cans of berkshire maple syrup are also to die for. No wonder these pancakes were featured on The Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\"The purpose of my review, however, is not to praise the already adored blueberry pancakes... but the VEGAN BENEDICT. I discovered this dish 5 years ago when I first visited BLD, mainly because I was actually vegan at the time (I am no longer vegan, but a pesco-vegetarian now). The vegan benedict is truly a magnificent balance of umami and savoriness... the combination of the housemade veggie patties made with black beans and spices, the smoked tofu patties that may beat any other soy-byproduct I have ever eaten, wilted arugula, lighted toasted english muffins brushed with olive oil, and impossibly creamy vegan hollandaise sauce all come together in perfect harmony. I always order the roasted fingerling potatoes on the side, which completes the dish and makes my tummy incredibly happy. Time over time again I always find myself ordering the vegan benedict, even though many of the other items on the menu are delicious as well. I guess I just can't stand the possibility of kicking myself after walking out of there realizing I just passed up one of my favorite dishes I have ever tasted. So if you have not yet tried the vegan benedict at BLD, or are reluctant to order it because it is \"vegan,\" please disregard all your previous preconceptions of vegan food and order this dish! It is truly delicious and satisfying, vegan or not. And remember, you can always get a side order of blueberry ricotta pancakes or share another dish with your dining companion to round out the entire experience. As always, don't forget to get a large pot of their strong frech-pressed coffee!", "Date": "2010-12-26", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Sara S.", "ReviewID": "zIjUPy2iDSnkQjsAhKOecw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "BLD= Breakfast yes! Lunch maybe? Dinner maybe not (at least for dineLA).Toning it down for DineLA this time since I went all out last round. First place I hit up is BLD for my friend's birthday. While their food was delicious, their service was mediocre-- hence the 3 star rating.I made a reservation for a party of 14 and was informed that the largest tables they have seat 12 so we had to go on separate tables. I was okay with that so I went ahead and made the reservation. Then it turns out that 1 person cancelled so I called to inform there would only be 13. We get to the restaurant and it's set up on two separate tables for a total of 12 seats...... Okay, I get that it's hard to come here with a party of more than 12, but when another of our members couldn't make it, we now had 12. LUCKY cuz they only set up for 12, are they psychic? We just asked to move our tables closer together so we wouldn't have to yell at the other table. The hostess was really rude and condescending and just said \"No I already told whoever made the reservation I can't do a party greater than 12.\" No explanation or anything (you could've just politely told us it was a fire hazard or something). Yet you seated only 12 anyway..... ehhh whatever. But the food... yum! 1ST COURSE: GRAPEFRUIT SALAD. MEHWhile I was pleased with my grapefruit + fennel + avocado salad, it was gone in like 5 seconds. And something was going on in the kitchen because my friend's salad looked nothing like mine. It was sad, had NO avocado and came with like 4 pieces of baby grapefruit. We all laughed at how comically WRONG it was to serve this. And though we pointed it out to the waiter, he brought it back from the kitchen with like 2 more pieces of grapefruit and still no avocado.... Disappointing. I tried my friend's carrot soup, which was quite hearty and almost curry like. It was definitely more filling than the scrawny grapefruit salad. I would get the lamb for the appetizer, it looked tasty and comes with filo! Who doesn't like filo? 2ND COURSE: BRAISED SHORT RIBS WITH MASHED POTATOES I have yet to visit a place who effs up short ribs, so this was no exception. Though it was quite yummy, I can't give BLD props for being exceptionally innovative and creative. Pretty standard. I tried my friend's fish with coucous which was pretty tasty. I'd have to say the 2nd course was the best all around. 3RD: WARM MONKEY BREAD WITH BANANA ICE CREAMMy friends really liked this dish, I thought it was OKAY. The monkey bread is crisp on the outside but it tasted a little stale to me or at least like it had been sitting around and then just ready made. You could also obviously taste like banana foster or some sort of liquor... ehhh don't know if they were going for that. One in our party ordered the vegan burger, which was actually very good and came with a hearty helping of fries.

As for the main dishes - I got the fried egg sandwich (I love me some fried eggs!) & the boyfriend got the steak & eggs. Honestly, I could have made that fried egg sandwich on my own because there was really nothing special about it, was quite over salted & greasy, too :[ Yes, a simple concept, but simple food can taste amazingly delicious, too... if made right! It was just okay for me. In addition, my boyfriend thought his steak and eggs weren't worth it and was simply \"meeeh\" and forgettable. Portion was pretty small for what it cost (there was more bread & eggs than meat!) and didn't make a big guy like him, very satisfied at all. Oh, and pass on the chorizo home fries... I, nor my boyfriend, could taste the difference between that and the fingerling potatoes. Ahhh... definitely didn't exceed my expectations and totally knocks off another star :[I still love the simplicity of this restaurant and the other choices off their menu with the exception of the \"meeeh\" food we ordered.

The tables were pretty close, so you can definitely get nosey and listen to other people's conversation. I think the atmosphere of the restuarant was intimate and pretty nice.My sister ordered the beef short rib and she really enjoyed it. I ordered the \"plate of the day\" which was fried chicken. OMG!! YOU HAVE TO GO ON A TUESDAY NIGHT AND ORDER FRIED CHICKEN!! It was sooo good!! I've never had fried chicken tasted THIS good before. The chicken itself was juicy, and the fried part tasted a little salty with a hint of honey in each bite. It came with a side of mashed potatoes, some greens, and this amazing corn bread. The corn bread was not dry at all, it tasted a little sweet, and came with a side of a spicy butter sauce that added a kick to it. I manage to finish every single bite, it was THAT GOOD! For dessert, we ordered a s'mores pie to share. It was really good, and got really sweet soon. But we did manage to finish every single bite of it. Overall, I had a great dinner here at BLD.

I was splashed on the head and I saw other guests get very upset as the rain picked up outside (and inside). -2 stars right off the bat for a poor dinning environment. The place was crowded so there were no other tables to move to.When I called to make reservations for brunch, I was told they only make reservations for parties of 5 or more until brunch is finished at 3pm. You are taking a gamble coming with a group up until about 2:30 pm when the crowds thin out. The wait to seat our party of 4 was about 25 minutes.The food:Fried Egg Sandwich on toasted sourdough with nueske's thick cut bacon, gruyere cheese, aioli, w/french friesThis was pretty good. Nice thick cut of bacon that was lighter and not over bacon-y. I would suggest asking for the aioli(thick mayo) on the side as it was super slopped on the sandwich and we had to wipe most of it out.Classic Eggs Benedict with canadian bacon, house made english muffin, hollandaise, w/Olive Oil & Thyme Roasted fingerling Potatoes I think this would have been good if it came out a bit warmer. I think this dish sat around for a bit. The potatoes had a good flavor although they were old and cold. The poached eggs were cooked correctly, but the yolks tightened up since they were sitting around. Again, maybe with correct temperature, this could have been a very good dish.Brioche French Toast with fresh berry compote, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, berkshire maple syrup.The best dish that came out. It is HUGE and can easily serve 4 people. Really great french toast complete with a little log cabin tin of maple syrup. Really great dish that I suggest everyone order and was the highlight of the meal.Wild Mushroom with aged goat cheese, pea tendrils, roasted shallots w/French Fries.This was a friend's dish and tasted ok. Not much more detail. Tons of mushroom flavor.House Made Tuna Salad Sandwich with roasted garlic aioli, mixed greens, sourdough bread, w/french fries .Another friend's dish. Some tuna sandwiches can be real gloppy with too much mayo and tiny shreds of tuna. Not here. Nice mix of big tuna chunks and less ailoi, \u00a0A nice light citrus finish was also in the mixed greens. Came with a janky sweet pickle. Where is the dill?Overall I was slightly let down and disappointed with the meal.

My fiance ordered the ricotta blueberry pancakes and a friend of ours ordered the brioche french toast -- both items that are rumored to be good. Well, when we received these items, it wasn't nothing spectacular to me. I've tasted better pancakes and french toast elsewhere. HOWEVER, their chive biscuits are to die for. They were very flaky and most inside. It looks like their pastries are far better off then their breakfast items. So, if you go, just order the pastries.", "Date": "2007-04-13", "Author_Location": "West Sacramento, CA"}, {"Author": "Josh K.", "ReviewID": "HcBNw88iIDCb_wCzmdJzwQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Pleasure Chest BLD is like the Grove. It sucks you in by it's luxurious looks and built up reputation yet once you enter it you feel like you've come in contact with some disinterested, high end call girl that's turned more hat tricks than Wayne Gretzky. \u00a0Plus, like the Grove the rush doesn't pick up until around 11 on a Thursday, only in LA. \u00a0The most striking similarity between BLD and the Grove is that they both represent evolutionary, commercial excess that fits LA like Brian Wilson in flip flops. I sat at the bar which was a regret because the bar stools were low to the ground and not easy to maneuver around like Snookie's balls. \u00a0The French Press coffee was ok but nothing to hot pitch or get wet over. But I did love those hash browns that came with see through, glistening , mandolin sliced, strips of chorizo that curled up into itsy bitsy bites that the Olsen Twins could live on alone if \u00a0it was substantial enough to hurl right back out. \u00a0I also got the \u00a0housemade turkey sausage frittata which was by far the best made, veggie decorated frittata I've ever savored at such a measured, oohing pace. The roasted tomatoes exploded with concentrated, sun dried flavor while the turkey sausage was lean but still moist and didn't come off as excessively dry or burnt out like Chelsea Handler. The homemade sausage and roasted tomatoes achieved awe inspiring blast off only after I tasted it paired with the scattered, precious little chunks of creamy feta cheese that in no way resembles that balled up crumbled shit that's dumped on side salads at gyro stands in Astoria, NY. Overall I thought BLD was cold and stiff yet what else should you expect from a high end, scrumptious destination that can charge whatever it wants as long \u00a0as the customers keep coming, more and more. Also when you breakdown the brunch landscape in West Hollywood you don't have another expert, dressed up, deal making spot that's so accessible and easy to find.

The experience was disappointing.First, our waiter was horrible. He was not able to give us recommendations on the food beyond \"oh yeah, that is really good, really smoky flavor.\" That was literally his answer for everything we asked about on the menu. He rarely checked in with us to make sure everything was okay throughout the meal and though they were fairly busy, it was not packed and he did not seem to have too many tables.Once we ordered, took an hour from when we ordered for our food to come out.We never got bread even though we asked for it and we had to ask our waiter twice for refills on water. Despite the fact that the restaurant was mostly full during the time we were there, there was only one bus boy who was doing all the water refills for the tables plus clearing tables and setting up new tables. When we asked our waiter for more water, our waiter went to the bus boy who had to stop setting up the table he was working on to come over and refill our water while our waiter basically watched. That annoyed me. Why couldn't our waiter do it?BAD BAD SERVICE!When the food came out, my food was warm but not hot. The sandwich my friend ordered came with cheese when she specifically asked for no cheese. When she ordered it we even had a conversation with the waiter about cheese, so he should have remembered/checked before it ever got to the table. It took us 5 minutes to get our waiter back over to tell him - we had to ask another waiter to get him over to our table. The waiter took the sandwich and about 7 minutes later came back with a \"new\" one. My friend took a bit and could still taste the cheese. She looked and didn't see any cheese, but the bread was soggy and the meat was cold by then - so clearly they had just scrapped the cheese off and sent it back out.The food itself was mediocre. The only thing any of ordered that we thought was good/worth ordering again was the mac 'n cheese and I can get that at other restaurants that are way better with much better service. For the amount of money they charge for the food, not worth it!The only good part was you can valet for $1 with validation. Maybe we should have gone for breakfast, but we won't be going back.

The service was way below average...I mean once I have to get up from my yummy meal more than 3 times to get help from someone else it kinda kills the dining experience. The waitress did appologize at the end which helped a little. Also the place was freezing...I felt like I had to scarf down my pancakes to eat them while they were still warm...lol...not really...always classy over here.Did I have a good time...of course...it's all about the company you keep...will i be back? you bet...I really wanna bump up that star status on BLD!

The bread was toasted golden, the bacon wonderfully butcher thick, and the egg and cheese oozing out from between toasted bread. The potatoes were a beautiful color, glistened with a coating of olive oil, and had a healthy amount of seasoning. The eggs were perfectly cooked with the yolk warm and gooey. The dominating taste in the first bite was salty. I had to venture deeper into the sandwich to taste the cheese and egg. When picking up this sandwich, the first word to enter my mind was \"oily\". The meal literally left a pool of oil on my plate. To be expected I suppose in a dish made with fried egg, bacon, and cheese. With each bite, I could feel my heart sputter and weeks being hacked off my lifespan. It was awesome. But when the novelty of what I was eating wore off and my hunger abated, I thought the last few bites just okay, but still incredibly fun to eat.

Second, the service: \u00a0Very professional. Everyone is hip, but sooo nice. \u00a0Very efficient, from the hostesses to the servers to the busboys, you ask for something, BOOM, you've got. \u00a0No attitude. \u00a0And never felt rushed, even on a busy, busy Sunday morning.And finally, the food: \u00a01. \u00a0Crepe with bananas and Nutella for my friend, came with whipped cream, very well made, good proportion of filling to crepe.2. \u00a0Hamburger for my young son. \u00a0We asked for medium (which means pretty much cooked, wee bit of pink, right?) \u00a0We got it pretty darn rare in the middle. \u00a0Not good for a little kid. \u00a0Granted the waiter overheard me mention this and offered to have it heated some more, which was great, but... medium is medium. The fries were skinny, fried just right, well seasoned and tossed with parsley, so good we all kept nabbing them off the poor kid's plate.3. \u00a0Eggs Florentine: \u00a0Perfectly cooked poached eggs (with no waterines or stringiness at all, that is annoying!) served on top spinach, on top fingerlings, all topped with drizzles of piquillo Hollandaise. \u00a0The heck is that? I don't know but damm it was good. \u00a0Also, home-made English muffins on the side, crispy and chewy and nice size.4. \u00a0And here's the kicker: \"THREE BEAN HUEVOS RANCHEROSfried eggs, crispy corn tortillas, queso fresco, avocado, salsa fresca\" \u00a0That is how they are described. \u00a0(Really, E, man o' mine? That is what you order at BLD???)This was the winner. \u00a0I kept tasting the refried beans trying to figure out the spices, and I am not a bean eater for the most part. \u00a0The fried corn tortillas were fresh and light and crispy. \u00a0Eggs, like the benedict eggs, perfectly poached. \u00a0Sauce was light and flavorful, tasted freshly made. It was all so balanced... An ideal version of a classic dish, minus the grease and heaviness and salt.So why they only four stars? \u00a0Bloody Marys were watery and had too much ice (those really skinny ice cubes that melt too fast). Mine was too spicy, E's was too weak. \u00a0We tossed them back and forth to sort of even them out, but it seemed like the bartender mixed both in one shaker, but forgot to shake. \u00a0For the first round I asked mine be mild, E. asked no celery salt on the rim. \u00a0Both came mild, no cerlery salt on the rim. \u00a0Next round, I let the server know I would like the salt rim. \u00a0I got it with margarita salt on the rim. \u00a0Yuck. \u00a0And the guys at the table next to us had celery salt rims, so not really sure what that was about.Other than bad Bloody Marys (4 @ $6), it was GOOD.", "Date": "2012-10-28", "Author_Location": "Culver City, CA"}, {"Author": "Matthew B.", "ReviewID": "xtHymQ3oOofAclW2S6lYRw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Their pork smells like a fart and their vegetable salad isn't fit for human consumption.", "Date": "2012-10-20", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Suzie Y.", "ReviewID": "NzlSY_o10_Okuz0KvQps4w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new favorite restaurant.

Where to begin?Fried Egg Sandwich: How this is a house favorite I cannot fathom. I kept telling myself if they just changed 'a' or 'b' it could be really good. Or 'c', and 'd'....Cold bacon (apparent house favorite), egg cooked over hard, aioli blobbed on one spot and inadvertently consumed in one bite leaving dry sourdough bread as the sole vessel for rubbery eggs and chewy bacon. The spanish chorizo home fries were similarly frigid, flavorless and the \"chorizo\" was really what appeared to be cold pepperoni.Andouille Sausage Omelet:When the plate arrived it looked like a plate of french fries. \"Score\" we thought. Who doesn't think this when getting a giant plate of fries. Think again. These were 4 hour fries. That's how long ago they had been previously cooked. Upon lifting the veil of fries we found thin, over-heat lamp exposed eggs enveloped this cold (a cold food trend forming) log of boredom floating in an orange grease pool (I am guessing from the MIA cheese?). The sausage? Um, avoid this at all costs. One time when I was 9, I ate canned cat food. As I chewed on my significant others omelet and my tastebuds compiled the data I was brought back to a memory. I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Ah ha! The cat food. I was slightly ashamed of my company for eating more than one bite. Even a 9 year old knows when enough is enough.We were not asked if our food was satisfactory AT ALL. We were not even addressed after receiving our food until we were delivered the check. I wish I had taken pictures because our food really looks nothing like the stuff here. Actually the sandwich pictures are pretty close. But instead of thinking \"warm bacon, creamy aioli\" think, \"dry dry dry\". It sorta makes the picture look different huh?Seems like BLD is precooking their food at certain times and lacking the consistency that should be required of a restaurant with these reviews.

That was the first disappointment of the meal.We were the only people seated outside so I can understand that the waiter is in a difficult position, but even taking that into consideration the service was terrible. We had to walk inside and ask for silverware after our appetizers were delivered and again after they removed those utensils and brought our main course. There was literally no one attending to us.We started the meal with some mussels. There are about ten mussels in the entire order, a very small portion of mussels by any account. They were fine and the sauce was pretty tasty, but there was no bread to dip in the sauce. When I asked for bread, the waiter returned about 15 minutes later with some toasted Wonderbread.Then, we split a Cuban sandwich. The bread tasted like a store bought panini and the filling was more like a ham sloppy joe than any Cuban I've ever sampled. It was a very uninspired take on a classic and simple sandwich.For our entrees I had the beef short ribs over mashed potatoes and beets. It was delicious. The meat was tender and the sauce was perfect with the beets and mashed potatoes.My friend ordered the lamb shank over a bed of lentils. He seemed happy enough but when I tried it out I found the lentils to be entirely inedible.

Like its sister restaurant, BLD features a beautifully cosmopolitan design that remains welcoming and inviting. I found the swooning tree in the recess at the rear of the restaurant to be particularly striking. The offerings are eclectic, but well-conceived. I was impressed with the cheese lists's inclusion of boschetto al tartufo - a wonderful mild Italian cheese with white truffle shavings that doesn't turn up in too many American restaurants. The self-constructed dinner is a nice choice for a main entre and is very reasonable in price. The hemp-encrusted tofu was too intriguing for me to pass up. I've never eaten hemp before or even seen it on a menu (my friend reasoned that if it's good in brownies, why wouldn't it be good on tofu). It's an unqualified success - the texture is soft and silky almost like the tofu found in soon dubu and the encrusting works \u00a0surprisingly well - just as well, in fact, as it does on fish. The resulting variance in texture this provides pushes the dish well beyond the tofu offerings at most contemporary American restautants, especially when paired with the basil pesto sauce. You get your choice of two sides and my fingerling potatoes and garlic rapini were both very well-executed. All this for only $16 (the price jumps to over $20 is you opt for the salmon or meat instead of the tofu). The only real drawback I saw to BLD at all was the noise level. Even on a Monday evening, there were times when it was difficult to hear across the table. Apart from that, a truly enjoyable evening.

The bass was also pretty tasty but I think that they cooked the skin too much because it was a little burnt and hard to chew.

Many other people were ordering the monkey bread so maybe we should have gone with that one instead.

We ordered the Bruleed Grapefruit, Spanish Frittata with house-made english muffin and home fries, Warm Lentil Salad since they were out of the Albacore Nicoise :(, and Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes. I wanted vanilla flavored coffee, but the nice waiter told me they don't have that but he can bring me a side of house-made vanilla syrup to add into my french pressed coffee. Yay, how nice :) The coffee was really strong and left me with shakes for a while, but it was fresh and tasty. The bruleed grapefruit was absolutely DELICIOUS. Juicy, bitter and sweet. The only problem I had with that was that it was a bit tough to pull the grapefruit off the peel and got a little messy and difficult to eat. The Spanish frittata was full of Manchego cheese and chorizo and was absolutely mind-blowing with each bite. Definitely my favorite item from what we ordered. The Ricotta blueberry pancakes were definitely the best pancakes I've tried so far. I do wish there were more blueberries in them, but they just had such a fluffy, yet rich moist texture. The maple syrup that came with the pancakes was buttery, delicious and came in the most adorable maple syrup tin I've ever seen in my life. I was food-coma stuffed by the time I tried the Warm lentil salad but it still had a good flavor and wasn't too heavy. A warm salad that was light and filling without the average texture of a salad. Loved the fried egg on top of the salad, I've never had fried egg on a salad but it was a great combination with the lentil.

We tried to call ahead but the automated menu was a bit confusing and not at all helpful. Not to be discouraged, we tried to make a reservation via open table, but it didn't seem to support large parties (we had 9) because we were told that \"There are no available reservations within 2:30 hours of the requested time\" for every hour we tried. Since we didn't really have a back up plan, we just decided to go and endure the wait if we had to.At 10:30am Saturday morning, we were seated (together) and browsing the menu almost immediately.

But I'll start with the good stuff, because I'm a nice girl:I went for dinner with my husband and another couple. For starters, we had the salad special (heirloom tomatoes and burrata cheese) and the Caesar. Both were delicious. I think Caesar salads are a great barometer for American (and some Mexican) restaurants. They seem simple, but it's so easy to miss the mark. This Caesar bordered on perfection - creamy, garlicky dressing, crispy romaine, thin-sliced parmesan, and two anchovy fillets. My three dining companions ordered the Half-Chicken Self Constructive Dinner (with polenta and squash), Fresh Tagliatelle (with pork sausage), and Linguini with Clams. With the exception of a bit of dryness in the chicken breast, everything was tasty, especially the pleasantly spicy tagliatelle. But, alas, now for the bad: We ordered a bottle of syrah and after a taste, my friend immediately turned up her nose. She remarked that it was very strong, and passed it to my husband, who said he didn't like it at all. Then I tried it, and agreed that it was strongly acidic and unpleasant. Instead of offering us something else, the waiter stood there, dumbfounded. Finally he asked if we wanted to order something else, then seemed annoyed by the prospect of getting us another menu. But, we ordered another wine and everything was fine.Then my food came. I had ordered the special, Seared Ahi with wasabi mashed potatoes and eggplant, and when I looked at the fish, it was completely white. I cut about an inch into it - still fully cooked. When the waiter came by I asked him if it was supposed to be seared? He said yes. I showed him my plate and he said, \"well, it should be cooler in the middle.\" So I cut into the middle, telling him that it wasn't seared at all. Again, the confused look and the \"uh, I guess I can get you another one?\" I said yes, of course. I'm not an overly difficult diner, but a $26 seared fish should be seared, right? After telling me that that might be their last one, he did bring me another entree, though his attitude implied that it was made special for my crazy demands. Le sigh. On the bright side, the fish was perfectly good (though a little UNDER-cooked, but what can you do?) and the wasabi potatoes were magical. So... will I return? I think it's worth a second chance, especially after hearing such good things about the brunch. (And who doesn't like brunch?)
