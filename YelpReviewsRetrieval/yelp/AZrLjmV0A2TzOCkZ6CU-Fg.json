Yes, they're \"Korean style\" and not your classic Hooters or B-Dub style wings. But, I personally guarantee you won't miss Buffalos or Tits at Crisp.* These wings put all wings to shame.Better quality. More meaty. Superior flavor. Go half order order of the Seoul Sassy and half order of the Buffalo for the ultimate sweet, tangy, spicy, savory satiation experience.I'm having a Pavlov's Dog moment now just thinking about them.Crisp is the ultimate fried chicken.No, really. And if you're just plain cuckoo and not into wings, they even do awesome bowls, bi bim bop and a KILLER Korean Burrito. Did I say Korean Burrito? I did. Wrap beefy bulgogi, rice and veggies in a flour tortilla and douce with creamy Atomic sauce.

I'm not a huge fan of that style bbq sauce in general and I didn't feel the korean spice significantly elevated the flavor. It's often a challenge ordering at these fusion places, you never quite know which ingredients and flavors will be retained in the dish. I enjoyed my meal though.

The three of us shared a big buddha bowl with brown rice and 10 wings - 5 Crisp BBQ and 5 Seoul sassy. FYI their wings are the ENTIRE wing. Yes, all three sections (dumbstick, flapper, and tip), so we basically got 20 wings and it was plenty! My personal favorite was the Crisp BBQ flavor since it was a bit less saucy and sweet.The bowl was decent. It was a nice break from the wings, but I thought it had TOO many vegetables. I did not like the random raw spinach leaves floating around. Also, where's the meat? Typically, bibimbap doesn't have that much meat, but it was almost nonexistent in this bowl.Overall, I really enjoyed the food.

If you see a small orange place that's packed you prb found it. We got 20 \u00a0wings for the 3 us and there was more then enough. The wings are pretty big and filling.

Don't come here for a first date, or an important business deal closing. Come here to get down on some wings.An interlude on gluten-free issues follows, so you may skip this paragraph if that doesn't matter to you. I'm gluten sensitive, so my first question was about the gluten-free nature of the wings. Here's what I learned: the wings have a rice-flour based batter (yes, GF!); the wings are not cooked in a dedicated fryer, so there can be contamination. Cut to the chase, if you have Celiac disease, I'd go the safe route and avoid them, but if you just have a sensitivity and can tolerate some contamination due to the likes of some errant onion ring batter then its on to the sauces. The only GF sauces are their Buffalo varieties (mild, spicy, suicide), of which I chose the spicy. All others contain soy sauce, thus some amount of wheat. I also ordered the Baby Buddha with beef, which can be gluten free as long as you avoid some of the sauces on the table (the staff was helpful in letting me know what was safe). That's what I ate, so I won't comment on the GF safety of other items, as I don't know.The review:Food ordered: 10 wings, half with spicy Buffalo (GF), and half with the Seoul Sassy (I think, those were for my friend, not GF), and the beef Baby Buddha (bi bim bap). One note, 10 wings here = 20+ wings at most places because Crisp give you the whole wing, end piece and all. Had we known this we'd have halved our order (wait, am I complaining about getting to eat more of these wings???)Frankly, the bi bim bap was good, but not great. I'd have been very happy to eat it on its own, and would have recommended the place to others on that alone. The complicating factor was the wings, which made the bap seem underwhelming due to their superb nature. So, I won't bad mouth it. The veggies were tasty, the beef cooked well, the egg was perfectly runny in the yolk, and the rice made an excellent canvas for the flavors. I added some of the different sauces (sparingly, due to most not being GF), and I really liked their flavors. (Note, I didn't mix sauces, just tried bits of each).If you can't already tell, I think the wings are the star of the show. I ordered mine with the spicy Buffalo sauce, but I think I'd have been happy with the sauce on the side in order to preserve the crispiness of the wings. The sauce was certainly tasty, but it definitely toned down the crunch. That said, the wings were still much crispier than wings I can usually find. I tried my friend's Seoul Sassy (not GF) wings, and they maintained a much better crunch, and I loved the flavor of the sauce. Also, the meat on the wings is both substantial and tender. My friend and I basically spent the whole meal in awe of how good the wings were. Further evidence? Okay. This is completely anecdotal, but the people sitting next to us had driven in from 45 minutes south of Chicago, on a Monday at 7 PM, to eat these wings. That is the type of the commitment that only things like religion and college sports fandom engender.Price:Totally reasonable. For two people, we had 10 wings (remember, more like 20), two orders of the bi bim bap, and I got a soda.

The guy took the sauces off our table before I even knew what they were then while we were eating he asked us if we needed a to go box, I told you they were serious about closing up at 9:30. But the workers were friendly when I asked questions about the wings and flavors, so overall the service was good they just rush you a little too much. The wings were also a little dry/over cooked for my taste.

Incredibly flavorful and balanced - sweet, savory, fragrant. HUGE juicy wings for a great price. I love that they include the tip of the wing, which is obviously the best part! This alone deserves five stars.The Crisp BBQ... tasted too much like just gochujang, and it could have been spicier and a bit bolder. We enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special. Same juicy, hot & fresh wings though.I wouldn't come this far for their buddah bowls or burritos since they're not that different from bibimbop everywhere, and neither is the budda sauce on the table, but for those in the area they are a great deal for the portion. I'd try one, but only as an addition to a gigantic order of seoul sassy wings.

I'm a fan, and the food serves as a wonderful way to absorb last night's debauchery sitting in my stomach. Though overpriced, the benefit of the greasy joy has outweighed the cost of shelling out a few extra bucks. However, I gripe in this instance. I just ordered 6 chicken tenders, a large fry and a Big Boy Buddha Bowl for delivery. 25 minutes later, I get a call from the delivery guy and go and grab the grub. I anxiously rip open the bag and prepare myself for a hangover-curing, grease-filled meal. I take out the chicken tenders and they look delicious, those were fine. I pull out the fries and it's a different story. Every single fry in the bag was soggy and ..moist. Crisp? No, the opposite. I then pull out the Big Boy Buddha Bowl and it's cold. The rice is next, which was so soggy that it looked like a Chinese food container full of mashed potatoes. I usually just wing it in situations like these, so I threw the fries in the oven and the Buddha Bowl in the microwave. The rice, unfortunately, was unable to be revived. I like Crisp, I really do.

I've been bored by the bbq flavors at other traditional bbq restaurants but this wing had a tangy asian bbq flavor that had me ripping my wing apart for every morsel of meat I could get at.

An aggregate rating of 4 stars after that many reviews was really impressive, which was why we decided to stop by after yelping for a place to eat in the neighborhood. Crisp is also the first Korean restaurant I have been to that eliminates most Korean sounding names from the menu. Bibimbap? It's called Buddha Bowl here; Bulgogi? It's in the Seoul Steak Bowl; Ban Chan? The People's Choice Greens! Ok, I wasn't bothered by the menu as much as the hubby who has spent a couple years in Korea, but the lack of Korean sighting in the restaurant did send chills down my spine.So a Baby Buddha Bowl (sub brown rice for $1.50 extra) for me, a Seoul Steak Bowl for him, plus five whole wings to share. My \"bibimbap\" was plain, there was no sauce in or on the side of my bowl. The sunny-side up egg was lukewarm--poor thing must have been sitting there while the wings were being cooked. His \"bulgogi\" was sliced into very small thin pieces, very frustrating for someone who prefers bigger pieces of meat (which Bulgogi tends to be). He likened the taste to a teriyaki bowl. Now the wings: they were whole wings (albeit on the bony side), which was not new to me since I had quite a few of them in the south. I am not a wing person, but would order them once in a while in a continuing quest for great wings that might transform me into a wing person and I am afraid these still didn't do it. I tasted very little besides the Korean red chili paste (Gochujang) and sugar in the Crisp BBQ sauce and the Seoul Sassy wasn't very memorable either. Yes, the skin was fried crispy but I would rather have my wings smoked or grilled, and seasoned well with some good spice rubs (like Jerk seasoning). \u00a0 Don't come here expecting authentic Korean food and you probably will enjoy your meal more than we did.", "Date": "2013-08-12", "Author_Location": "Carol Stream, IL"}, {"Author": "Courtney W.", "ReviewID": "doWDEzRSIz17EsF0Jv1w5A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was really expecting something fantastic and mind blowing.

They were better than $0.50 wings at Buffalo Wild Wings but not that much better to justify that price. I think Pecking Order has better wings, if you don't mind traveling a little farther north for them they are so worth it. The chicken bowl was interesting and way too much, you could easily split this. In my opinion there was just too much rice and sauce and not enough chicken.

They promised within the hour and they made it just in time. $5 is pretty steep for one and a half miles though. I would have walked there if I didn't have Lollapalooza to get ready for.Food:The quality and portions are there. I had a Bulgogi Beef Bowl with an egg on top with extra meat. \u00a0I usually order extra meat otherwise they give you way too much rice and not enough beef. The quality of the beef is up there, but I haven't exactly experienced top class Korean Beef yet. It is not to sweet with a balanced amount of seasoning with tender meat. I like it! The rice is also very good quality, but I don't know what country the rice comes from, I still can't tell the difference between Japanese and Korean rice. As a rice eater my whole life, the rice here definitely makes me happy. The fried egg was pretty blehhh. Blandest egg of my life sadly. I really enjoy this dish though, and it will satisfy the hunger beast. The Seoul Sassy fried chicken was a new experience for me. I really enjoyed the seasoning, but I feel the quality of the meat is not up to par with most respectable chicken establishments. I really want to order the chicken strips with the Seoul Sassy seasoning next time.All in all, I will order here again for sure!

But not this place, the wings were perfectly sauced. Although the Plain Jane's were also good, we both agreed, the Seoul Sassy is the way to go. Perfectly fried(so bad but so good) and the sauce didn't overwhelm the flavor of the perfectly seasoned meat. Also, these are jumbo wings people not some tiny bdub sized wings.

Not the porn version -- I'm talking about the regular ole film version of the Clive Barker short story. Don't worry if this piece of cinematic magic is news to you, the rest of the review will have nothing to do with this flick -- plus, I'm gonna spoil it for you right here: Reptile people + the tried and true lesson that when you see something strange going down on the subway, you just better mind your own damn business and keep on your merry way. Where was I again? \u00a0So those two versions of Midnight Meat Train are the ones that the general public is more likely to know about, but MY midnight meat train is actually a train of thought where when it gets late and I'm alone, I entertain the thought of giving up the whole vegetarian thing I've been working on the past 5 or 6 years, and sneaking some bites of something that used to be alive. Something that's now taken on the form of fried chicken or bacon or beef jerky or anything that's really sh*tty for you and once had a heart. To date, I've been able to resist purchasing my ticket to ride the midnight meat train of thought, but f*ck is it ever gonna be hard now that I've tasted the sweet, spicy sauces cloaking Crisp's fried chicken flesh. It's pretty much all I can think about, and that's not a good sign for my feathered friends. Today was the first of many future visits to Crisp, thanks to tag-team combo of Danny W and the serendipitous running into of Matt \"Lollycakes\" L. Less any poultry fragments in the spoonful of sauce I scraped off Danny's basket-o-chicken bits, I refrained from hopping on the noon o' clock meat train, but that sauce... F*ck. it was so good. So good I literally ate it alone with a spoon. For my meal I got the Big Boy Buddha bowl with tofu, which is pretty much a bibimbap blend of goodies. It was enough for lunch, second lunch while I sat in traffic for two hours on my drive back to the 'burbs, pre-dinner (or as Hobbits would call it, elevensies) and will likely last through my real dinner as well. At $11 for an almost literal trough full of food, I'd say that's a steal. Inside is pretty tiny and they've got the whole communal table set-up thing going, which I definitely hate, but I guess when you're working with such a small space, it'd be hard to do anything but. All the napkins, chopsticks, etc are in the middle of the tables, and you have to share sauces with everyone else at your table (also hate sharing), so that kind of stinks, but what're ya gonna do? I lathered my bowl in sriracha, but I would've love to try their Buddha sauce. Unfortunately, it was across the table and when I weighed out my options and I decided I'd rather not have to make any conversation and not have the sauce, than have it, so perhaps next time I can better align myself to be on the side of the table that houses all the sauces so having to socialize is a non-issue. The counter people were refreshingly friendly and they have Honest Tea in like eight different flavors so you know I was happy because that sh*t is good as hell. If you haven't had it, defo try maxin' on some white peach flavor.

Korean BBQ chicken tenders: Your traditional chicken tender tossed in a combo Korean-American BBQ. The sauce is slightly spicy, tangy, and sweet. Had an interesting, almost gritty texture at times. Good, but not as mind-blowing as the Seoul wings.3. Fries: Pretty typical skinny-sliced fries tossed with a bit of salt in a paper bag.All-in-all, a delicious and very filling meal.

Since we're actually 2 blocks outside of their posted $3 delivery range - \u00a0 I was quite pleased to learn they'd deliver to us for a slight surcharge of $2 ($5 total for delivery).We were a big group so I ordered 3 chickens, but since I didn't know the sweetness or spice factor of the sauces - i decided to order two chickens plain with the sauce on the side and only one with sauce on it. \u00a0The order arrived timely, though I was a bit annoyed that my delivery instructions weren't followed with regards to the door to deliver to - Of course this wasn't a surprise since the delivery guy was also missing the charge slip for me to sign - so I basically had to write a note on the back of a piece of paper he was carrying telling them they could charge my card. \u00a0The delivery issues were a little annoyance that could have been shrugged off quickly had everything been good within the bags.Alas - upon bringing the bags upstairs to our house and unpacking them - we discovered we had no sauce. I checked the order form - the sauce was listed. \u00a0I phoned Crisp and informed them that part of the order was missing. \u00a0The guy I spoke with was the same one who had taken my order, and he apologized and said he didn't know how fast he could get the sauce to us but would request it. \u00a0We said ok, we'll wait - this was fine since our two orders of french fries were a soggy, steamed mess and we'd fired up our oven to crisp them back to life - we had time to wait.About ten minutes later Natalie called back from Crisp to tell us that she would not be able to send over our sauce. \u00a0She instead offered us a credit of $5 on a future order - To which we replied: we were not interested in a future order because we aren't very impressed with the rather dry plain chicken we received (nor the soggy fries ... though they did return to life rather nicely after 15 minutes in the over - perhaps they are best eaten at the restaurant)..My husband, son and I are all long time food service veterans and we were pretty shocked at the sad state of Crisp's customer service. \u00a0We understand glitches occur - bad nights happen. \u00a0You don't get all these great reviews or stay in business by \u00a0delivering \u00a0dry chicken repeatedly - but you won't have a chance to ever deliver a good chicken to my house because the way I was treated as a very good paying customer ($100 for 3 chickens, 3 buddha bowls & 2 orders of fries --- I think that's a fairly substantial order & a good potential customer - I know that Richie Melman would think so).So, if you're thinking of ordering from here - I'd say that there are lots of Korean chicken options and definitely lots of buddha bowl type Asian places where the management will value and appreciate you as a paying customer so I recommend rewarding those establishments with your hard earned dollars and skip Crisp - you can do better.", "Date": "2013-10-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Buttermilk P.", "ReviewID": "fh5CHxT67j4ovapUuizEtQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been thinking about things.

Such \"CRISP\" skin, and tasty. That's what I love about chicken wings first! Then the meat, which wasn't skimp and a lot for the money! For the flavors, the Seoul Sassy wings were sweet with some Korean spices and soy. It was marinated so throughly that the meat inside had some of the flavors found with the outside skin & sauce. These wings were rather glazed and not hardcore saucy like the ones I found on the Crisp BBQ. Those wings were like you were eating BBQ ribs. Saucy, and thick. It was spicy & sweet, and gave a little kick. Not overly done, just about right! Man so DELICIOUS!The fries were also good if you are into crispy fries. On the table they had these two sauces, one called something-something Atomic, and the other was called Buddah sauce. I fell in love with the Buddah sauce & rather use ketchup just layered my fries with it. Off the tip of my tongue, I knew what the sauce was, but even while I am writing this review, it still alludes me, but man was it g-o-o-d!Other things that Crisp offers are these bowls that looked like they were worth trying as well and also sandwiches. Being the ease dropper I am, the chicken bowl looked tasty. They also offer burritos which are what are in the bowls, but wrapped up, so if you want variety, there you have it.I left full, only finishing 4 wings, and half the fries. The smell of the wings in my hotel room right now makes my mouth water. Is it worth all the hype? As a out of towner, I think so if you are into Asian flavors and chicken wings is your thing!4.5/5 Stars!

It is served cool/room temperature (like Crisp's) or in a hot stone bowl (dol sot bibimbap). It is supposed to be this way. If you do not like this, go to a Korean joint that serves the dol sot variety. Just because American food isn't served this way doesn't make it wrong- become informed about Korean food before criticizing it.2. \"IT'S NOT HEALTHY!\" - Nobody is claiming this stuff is diet food. They're a Korean-American fast food joint. They are selling fried chicken wings, french fries, onion rings, and fried mushrooms. If you're concerned about your bibimbap having a little sesame oil in it, please know that \u00a0it contains vitamin e (an anti-oxidant), it helps lower cholesterol, and it also contains magnesium, copper, calcium, iron and vitamin B6.

But KFC was the last thing on my mind when I started planning this trip until I started reading about Crisp on various food blogs and Web sites. So on our second day in Chicago, having tackled White Castle and Greek food the night before, I skipped out on the city's pizza, hot dogs, and Italian beef sandwiches and headed to Lakeview for some KFC.The essence of Korean fried chicken lies in its sauces and Crisp has three different offerings (Crisp BBQ, Seoul Sassy, and Bud's Buffalo). We ordered two whole chickens and went for the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy.The Crisp BBQ is a Korean sauce that's got a mild heat, which was nice because other spicy KFC sauces I've had have totally blown out my taste buds. If you're like us and like trying different flavors of KFC, then you'll appreciate that even more. The heat does linger on your tongue, and I love that.As much as we liked the Crisp BBQ sauce, the Seoul Sassy was our favorite. The ginger, garlic, and soy-based sauce was excellent, one of my favorite KFC sauces ever. This basket of chicken disappeared faster than that Crisp BBQ.Sauces aside, the most important thing about this fried chicken is that it lives up to its name. The chicken skin is crispy, despite being drowned in sauce, and it's juicy too. I'm pretty confident that most fried chicken fans could order the sauceless Plain Jane chicken and be very happy.We got a chance to talk to Jae Lee, one of Crisp's owners, and he was really cool. I told him that we don't have Korean Fried Chicken like this in the SF Bay Area and that this rivaled the KFC we had in New York. Jae told us that he went to New York as part of his research and sampled pretty much everything they had to offer. Because of our conversation, our next New York trip is going to feature a trip to Unidentified Flying Chickens in Jackson Heights. But if you're in Chicago, definitely check out Crisp if you're looking for some excellent Korean fried chicken.As their slogan says, \"The bird is the word.\"", "Date": "2008-11-15", "Author_Location": "Oakland, CA"}, {"Author": "Tom K.", "ReviewID": "v8K1Dd3WGcT8xyGrFuWmrg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The wings are amazing.

It was going to be an interesting experiment to say the least, as none of us had ever stepped foot into Crisp.Renowned for their Korean style fusion wings, my wing radar always detected good wings were in the neighborhood with every step in Boystown. Every time getting off the Belmont CTA stop, I lamented that I was so close yet so far. Parking around Crisp was a cinch at 2:30pm this Wednesday afternoon. We entered Crisp to find one other person outside of our group already waiting for wings and ample space all around to sit where we pleased.Approaching the counter, there stood an impressive display of all the various sodas all for the price of $1 with Vitamin Water for $2 including fan favorites such as Coke Zero, A&W Root Beer. Alongside the pop cans were the various house bowls featuring Bulgolgi and Bi Bim Bap combinations with the Bi Bim Bap serving as the main vegetarian fare for any potential non-meating-eating friends. Without any vegetarians on hand, it was clear that we'd all dive into chicken seventh heaven from wings to fully glazed fried chickens to chunks of chicken in bi bim bap bowls.Knowing that I would be getting a full order of 10 wings, I was surprised when they told me that they had more than one flavor for the wings. For some reason I thought Crisp relied only on the Korean sweet and sour recipe but saw they had BBQ and several kinds of Buffalo Sauce. I've had BBQ and Buffalo sauces from all over the place, so I decided to stick with the basics and go with the Seoul Sassy flavors and an order of fries. A can of Coke Zero accompanied my order, which is always a bonus because Coke Zero definitely doesn't taste like Diet Coke.My friends all ordered in lockstep various dishes and everyone had some wings on the way. I noticed the business card on crisp declared their head chef the house master of wings. Was it true? Could these wings be as magical as Wings Around the World? We sat down at one of the large tables and awaited our orders.As my basket of wings and fries was the first dish ready, I had the uncomfortable ordeal of waiting for everyone's else's food to arrive. I could no longer adhere to the rules of conduct of good manners and picked off a few fries while waiting since it was pushing 3 o'clock and I hadn't had a bite to eat all day! I saw some bowls of Bi Bim Bap materialize, a half of a fried chicken dropped in, and another full order of Crisp wings and then realized it was time to go to down!As with most wing eating experiences, this one was no different, the obligatory wing exchange was facilitated and I traded in one of my Sweet Sassies for a Crisp BBQ-flavored wing. All of the wings were properly fried hard and I found the texture of the wings both majestic and comforting. The Crisp BBQ flavor was less than impressive, with a clumsy taste akin to kim chee. There was heat on thse wings, but there was not enough sweetness, but I didn't mind trying one for the sake of trying.After the exchange ritual, I happily dug into my own set of Seoul Sassy and got the rush of flavor that I expected. Sweet and tangy with a subtle hint of spice, the magic combination dazzled my taste buds and even the little pieces of green onion served to heighten the experience. There is something to be said about Korean wing recipes, and there's no better food experience than tasting a recipe that tries to balance out the different taste sensations and savoring sweet success with every single bite. \u00a0The portions were massive and I found myself full after eating about five full-sized wings while another friend threw in the wet nap after four wings. In retrospect, taking pictures of all of the food before we all demolished all of it proved to be fortuitous timing.In the end, we had way too much food for our own good and thus went our indoctrination into the wonderful world of Crisp. It was a pleasant experience to say the least, not having fight off crowds and being able to enjoy a meal with friends without having to feel like the walls were caving in. Were Crisp wings better than Wings Around the World? It's a Tale of Two Wings and I don't think that's a fair comparison as they're entirely different beasts.

They look real tasty! But thats because I love fried eggs on top of my meals!They also have Burritos with an Asian twist of flavors!

As soon as I got in my car and smelled my food, I knew I was in for a tasty treat. I JUST finished eating half a Baby Buddha Bowl with Beef (their version of bi bim bop). It was so good. Actually, it was GREAT and hit the spot perfectly. If I had two stomachs, I would finish the rest cuz that 'baby' was big (for me). The vegetables and egg were cooked perfectly and the beef had a nice mild, smoky flavor. My rice was on the side since I got it to-go. Is it authentic Korean? I don't know, and frankly, I really don't care. It was damn delicious! I also ordered 5 Seoul Sassy Wings not knowing I was going to get a sweet surprise. These wings are HUGE! \u00a0They are not your typical bar wings that are puny and laden in grease. The drumstick and wing together count as 1 wing. They have an interesting and totally different taste that is not common amongst your KFC or BW3-type joints. Score! I was only able to eat one even though I tried in vain to have another. But I couldn't. I'm so full!Honestly, if you're having a get-together at your house get your wings from here and invite me please! =) Your friends will not only thank you, but they'll be thoroughly impressed. They're amazingly good. The staff was very friendly and my food came out quickly. I'll definitely be coming back to try the other sauces.

I am not a chicken lover. \u00a0In fact, I often refer to it as chucken- \u00a0(as in upchuckin- what I sometimes find myself doing after I eat it).Just so \u00a0you get the \u00a0full picture.  I decided to try Crisp today with a friend who had been craving some fried chicken. \u00a0I was game, why not-try something new, break the habits, experience life. \u00a0Ya, it was just lunch, and we can all do without another sandwich in our lives. \u00a0 I ordered the lunch special- total of $6.97 with tax, and WAY more food than I could consume. \u00a0Three HUGE wings, fries, and a can of my preference. \u00a0Let me tell you, these were HEALTHY BIRDS. \u00a0They flew HIGH and LONG before their demise. \u00a0They had MEAT on their BONES. \u00a0Well, the BONES- they were a problem. \u00a0See, I am one of those persnickety eaters who likes to think that meat is manufactured at some factory, and never, ever wants to see bones attached. You could say that I have a FOOD BONE phobia. \u00a0I know the truth ( my grandmother owned a locker plant, I was often the city kid locked in back with the sides of beef and pork as a prank by my uncles, this may have something to do with my phobia). \u00a0Being polite, and somewhat hungry and curious, I was determined to attempt this food, bones and all. To eat these monster wings, I had my choice of chopsticks (not an option unless someone wanted to get hurt), a plastic fork, and my fingers. \u00a0Um, nope, I could not handle my fingers, so the plastic fork was my tool of choice. \u00a0Ironically enough, Bryan Adams was belting out \"Cuts like a knife\" on the oldies radio- and the fork worked!! The chicken was tender enough that a plastic fork- for the most part- was able to tackle the job!I tried the Korean BBQ. \u00a0It was spicy and nice. Not too hot, and did not burn. \u00a0I had a taste of the Seoul blend from my friends. \u00a0It was good too. \u00a0I ended up consuming 2 of my wings, tossing one to my friend, and trying a part of one of hers. \u00a0All in all, a fantastic lunch.I do think I misordered. \u00a0They had some FANTASTIC looking bowl combos- with veggies, brown rice, etc. \u00a0Next time, I am heading for that, I am confident it will be good, and know that I do not have to deal with my bone phobia!", "Date": "2008-07-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Rachel W.", "ReviewID": "GdyHgUWML8FT9GsPHsuYHA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For months now I've found myself salivating in our home office, as the smell of fried chicken wafts in through the window and fills my apartment with deliciousness. For those of you who know well the smell I speak of, you know there's nothing like it in all world. Even if I had just eaten an enormous dinner, I'd smell the eu de crispyness and say to my other half, \"Man, we've really got to go to that chicken place. It smells SO GOOD\". So, finally we made our trek over their last week. I decided it was the perfect opportunity to partake in fried goodness, as I needed to 'lay a foundation' pre-Nisei drinking or, as the boyfriend calls it, 'harden my arteries'. I thought I was very clever about the whole thing and was super excited to dine.....and totally missed the fact that we were both in blazing white shirts. Not exactly the wardrobe choice for barbecue fans the world over. Not so much.Luckily, I decided to play it safe and just get their 'plain jane' wings with the sauces on the side. My shirt survived unscathed. Mike got the 1/2 barbecue chicken. Everything tasted good, but we both found the meat to be a little lacking. Now, this may be due to the fact that, unlike KFC, Crisp uses real animals when making their food and not genetic-mutant-headless-full o' meat-freak birds, but worth mentioning anyway. I liked the communal seating, how everything was super clean, the choice of beverages, and the BYOB option. The owner at the counter was extremely friendly and nice, and offered to show us some of the orders coming out so that we could gauge what size/ type of item we should get. He also followed up and made sure to ask us what we thought of everything, which I really appreciate. The next time I go back, I'm going to try something a little bit more adventurous and bring some beer or wine to enjoy.Of course, it's worth noting that Mike's white linen shirt did in fact die a sudden, messy, and bloody (looking) death. All down the front of him. It was terrible. We dropped the shirt off at the cleaners yesterday, with Mike explaining it as a \"possible gone-er\" to the nice little lady behind the counter. Lesson learned- wear something you're wiling to stain and/or throw out, or big up and wear a bib!--------------------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------------------------------*update 5/8/2008*Mike's shirt is confirmed dead.

And that, is most definitely what Crisp is.Eight of us flooded the joint, among the other people in the restaurant, scouring the menus to find the perfect fried chicken option. George and I noticed as we approached the counter that the gigantic flat screen TV up front was listing meal options, so we immediately opted for the meal deals, but look quick! For the picture changes pretty rapidly. Feeling like a professional, I walked up to the counter and ordered the Funke #2 (or was it 3) -- Five Chicken Wings (your choice of flavor/sauce) with the house-made potato salad and coleslaw. I opted for the Buffalo Bud's because I'm a whore for Buffalo-style chicken, and I got it \"spicy\" -- the middle option of the spicy scale at Crisp. The guy at the counter suggested I order the fries, because the potato salad is COLD, so I agreed and got the fries. The food came out incredibly fast, and as Mike looked on, I bit into the chicken wing. It was spicy, more spicy than I was expecting, but interestingly, the spice wore off. Each wing after that that I ate just wasn't as spicy as that first one -- did I adjust? Was it just the initial shock of spice? Either way, after that, it just wasn't the same. As oft-readers of Chavi know, I'm also a whore for coleslaw, and I usually gauge a restaurant by how well they can make a batch of coleslaw. I was expecting some alternate type of slaw, perhaps with an Asian flare or something, so when I got the coleslaw -- which, mind you, is completely pureed -- I was pretty disappointed. It had a good taste, it was your typical, basic coleslaw, but the lack of creativity and the fact that it was PUREED completely grossed me out. Coleslaw is meant to have a certain texture, and that is not one of puree. This, folks, is the result of a loss of a half star. As far as the fries, well, they were your basic, greasy stringy fries. Nothing special, nothing unique. I know it's an Asian fried chicken joint, but I was expecting a dash of something. This, of course, is the result of the loss of another half star. So I'm dishing out four stars, because the chicken -- the tour de force -- was really amazing, spicy or not. The joint is clean and crisp (har har har) and the staff was super friendly and amusing, not to mention that they listen to their customer's every want and need. And the fact that the guy at the counter told one of our gals that he couldn't -- in good conscious give her ranch with her chicken wings -- is a good man in my book.

Not to say of course that it was bad at all, because it wasn't.Prior to it's makeover, you could tell the establishment was fairly new and they were just getting used to their feet wet.Their menu had your general variety of Korean foods, pure and traditional in every sort of way. It was always funny to see the ol' man telling the Mexican cooks how to make the bulgogi with utter scrutiny. Can't blame him - he wants his customers to experience the real deal.I practically went here at least 3 times a week.I moved up further north and moaned the loss of such a reliable, tasty, and friendly establishment. I come back around the area shopping, happen to pass by and notice it's closed down, with all the windows covered up. They're renovating. \"Awesome\", I say to myself.They finally opened up, with a brand new menu selection and revamped decor.Oh how I was disappointed. One can never really figure out the circumstances behind any change a business makes. I can take a slight guess however.Diversey and Clark is drowning with your average variety of downtown workers who are in their 20's and 30's, living the life. \"Yuppies\" so to speak? Very american, very metro. It's definitely a customer base that has high expectations. So the new change? I get it. It is a business after all.Despite however you might interpret this review, I really like this place. They still serve some of the same meals they did prior to the make over. But then there's some of the new items that are off the wall and rather degrading. Yes, I refer to their menu section, \" You so crazy? Korean Burritos\". My grandmother would have a heart attack if she saw crap like this and knew even a lick of american euphemisms that stereotype Asians. Of course I don't take it seriously, it's all fun and all. I get it.But I personally don't think they had to go so far as to lose their dignity with silly concoctions i.e. Dakota Seoul Steak (Philly Cheese? Are you serious?? Philly Cheese and asian food stopped being friends when some idiot decided to invent the Philly Cheese Roll)?Ultimately, it's a tough call personally. What I did order, which was the Buddha which natives know as the Bi-Bim Bop, was very good. And the same folks before the renovation were still there, just as nice and hospitable as before.Go hit the place up. If you're looking for a fun time with an interesting introduction to korean cuisine, dashed with some awkward pairings of american recipes - it'll make your stomach fit right in.But if you're looking for real Korean food, think a little elsewhere.

So an order of 5 is like an order of 10 everywhere else. The breading is the signature here. Very very thin and very crisp. I usually eschew breading on wings, but this was very good. The wing sauce is unique here, not your usual half Franks Red Hot, half butter. This was more of an Asian chili paste-based sauce. Very good, even if it wasn't exactly what I had in mind. I'll be back to try the other sauces, and also I want to try the beef bolgogi burrito.

It was really good, but was lacking something, wasn't sure what it was, and then half way through the meal realized I hadn't put in the hot sauce....dang it!

I order the Seoul Steak Bowl with brown rice. I should have gotten to get the Chicken bowl, but thought it would still be okay due to the Seoul Sassy sauce on the beef as well. WRONG. The meal in front of me was rice with shredded beef on top, simply. I was not happy and still hungry after six of so not great mouth fulls. I then ordered the recommend (per yelp reviews) Seoul Sassy chicken wings. The two stars is only do the this: very crisp breaded chicken with juicy, tender meat. Tasty with a good presentation. Yet, the sauce just OK; nothing great. They made up for the bowl somewhat with the Seoul Sassy chicken wingsMy disappointment (and lost of one star) came mainly from the customer service. Even though I let them know that I was not happy with the bowl, nothing was done to make sure I left a happy customer. \u00a0When I ordered a second dish (wings), I was asked about the bowl, which I told him I did not like.

Crisp, you are the first restaurant I KNOW that did not offer a refund or a replace order when the customer informed you they did not like it. Maybe there is a no refund sign somewhere...this was my thoughts on the ride home to give them the benefit of the doubt. \u00a0In addition, please check on your restrooms for cleanliness every hour or so. The ladies room was not kept well today.Overall, I will not be back and I feel they will not care.

Like actually gigantic. You know how if you go to a restaurant like bdubs and order wings, each wing is really just a wing section? Like either a drumette or one of those middle pieces with the two bone? Well one wing here is a whole wing, including the drumette, middle, and tip, so an order of 10 is really the same as ordering 20 normal wings. Also factor in that the wings are deep fried and slathered in sauce to help you decide how much you would be able to eat.Our group of three ordered 10 wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce (clever clever) and a Seoul Steak bowl, all to share. I had 2 wings and a scoop from the bowl, and I was done. The other girl also ate about as much as me. My third friend (a guy) is a beast and ate the remaining 6 wings and half the bowl, what a champ.As for the food, it was okay but not my favorite. The wings were super fried, and the sauce was way too sweet for my tastes. The bowl was okay, although I wish it came with some veggies (my friends ordered for me since I was running late, so maybe it was my fault). The sauce that you can put on top was amazing but also super rich and spicy. I think it was called Angie's something something - get this and try it with your bowl!

And I'd like to take a minute so just sit right there. I'll tell you how it came to be with this Crisp-y love affair...Okay okay, bad Crisp pun. But really now, folks. Crisp is for real.After the many reviews that I've read and the number of times that I failed to get there by their 9PM closing hour, I finally found myself standing in line to order some of the most delicious finger food ever. EVER.Now I've had my fair share of chicken, wings in particular. Crisp takes poultry to a whole new level. Something about the crunchiness, or \"crisp\"iness if you will, of the wings makes them so divine...and they aren't, like, breaded or anything. Weird.But that's not all! Crisp offers three sauces. On this visit, which was also my first, my girlfriend and I tried the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. Out of all the chicken that I've eaten, the Seoul Sassy somehow manages to leap over almost all of the competition. It's a simple, but perfectly executed, sauce that consists of ginger, soy sauce, garlic, and other seasonings and is topped with scallions. Maybe it's the familiar flavors [I'm a Chinaman], but it definitely hits all the right spots, and then some. The Crisp BBQ was, how do I say this, unexpectedly hot. It wasn't over-the-top ghost chili pepper hot. But it did have an interesting smokey taste to it. Yeah, smokey.We also ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl with beef. The reviews are a little much on these bad boys. It's a real simple dish with rice, veggies, and your selection of meat. It's really hard to mess this one up...Now about halfway through the meal I began to think about how this review would turn out. I liked the wings, but the Buddha Bowl was just okay. Do I give em a four? Are they worthy of the five star status? The deciding factors were the chicken and.............SERVICE!! The guys here rock. They were very welcoming and offered personal opinions and fan favorites. The Crispy Men answered questions about ingredients and even made small talk to pass the time.Stellar service and delicious food. I'll definitely Check-in again.

Not really sure where they got ideas to name their dishes, but non the less everything we ordered was good. Crisp BBQ chicken is spicy and sweet. Probably closest to a typical Korean flavor, the sauce has 'go-chu-jang' which is the korean spicy sauce. I think the sauce was made with go-chu-jang and honey. Seoul Sassy was very sweet. Think of any teriyaki flavored chicken wings you've had in the past. I wouldn't recommend ordering a whole chicken of one flavor. Go half and try a couple different flavors. The best part, however, is the skin! My god is it crispy. I was biting off every possible little piece of skin attached to the bone. None of the grease, and all of crispiness. The Buds are good as well, definitely one of the better dumplings out there. The sauce that comes with is slightly sweet and different. Salad was... eh. okay. they cook the mushroom a bit with sesame oil so that adds a nice aroma and flavor. Korean style fried chicken, when done right, is the best thing ever. It's never fatty, super crispy, and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, Crisp isn't it. For those who are familiar with Korean style chicken, you won't get it at Crisp.

No, I am not talking about Kentucky Fried Chicken. If you follow Toronto food scene, or any food scene around the world right now- KFC means Korean Fried Chicken. It all started in New York when Bon Chon made it's way to Manhattan. People were getting tired of regular deep fried chicken (which I still love) and wanted something different.And then KFC came along, with their soy sauce marinade that's sweet and tangy or spicy sauce with a kick. KFC trend is going far that you can randomly find it at hipster tapas place that is not Korean restaurant.Crisp is def one of the spin off from the KFC trend in America, they are known for deep fried chicken called Seoul Sassy and people from Chicago were all over it! I knew I had to give it a try. Crisp is a small place with as many seats crammed in as possible. By the time I went, all the tables were full except the side tables. Since we were there for a quick bite, it didn't really matter and we just took the side seats. Also, it was a second stop after my first meal- my friend and I were already so full. We just ordered Seoul Sassy Half chicken for $8.95. Seoul Sassy is a 'subtly sweet sauce prepared with ginger, soy, garlic and spices'. Chicken takes awhile because it's made when you order. I think we waited good 20 minutes for it to come out, but it was worth it at the end.Their chicken is deep fried with very thin batter but it comes out super crispy. Then it is covered in sauce as it is cooked again so the batter soaks up most of the goodness so that most of it ends up in your mouth, not your hands! Chicken was fresh and the meat was so juicy bursting with flavor. It was a little on the salty side, just to be eaten on it's own. The sauce had really strong garlic flavor and it was topped with green onions as well. Def not a food to eat on a date. Summary: Overall it was a good KFC, I just wish I had room to try other things off the menu like their Buddha Bowl which is basically a BiBimBab but with variety of vegetables you can choose from.

First of all, I'm a big fan of Subway so I go there a lot. And whenever I sit right in front of the window, I always see people going to the restaurant next to Subway. That made me wonder what kind of restaurant Crisp was. When I found out that it served great chicken wings, I decided to look it up on yelp and see if it's worth checking out. Well, of course I checked it out!1. My first visit didn't really WOW me except for the fact that the guy behind the counter was extremely nice. I had a half chicken plain jane and the guy gave me 4 sauces to try out because I was new to the place and didn't know what to get. That was very thoughtful. My boyfriend loved the sauces so I took some of them and put it in my purse for later usage. Anyway, the place was very picnic-ish so I thought that was cool. 2. Now, my second visit definitely made me start loving the place. When I got there, the dude behind the counter remembered our names already! I decided to try the Seoul Sassy wings and my boyfriend wanted to try the crispy BBQ wings. Oh. My God. We were both devouring and scavenging our plate. We wanted to have a conversation but to heck with that--we wanted to eat and eat and eat because everything was delicious. We had to grab a ton of paper towels because our hands were covered in the awesome sauce. Later that night, I was craving for more. I really do think they put crack in them 'cause they're addicting!3. I visited them like 3-4 days in a row until my boyfriend told me that it wouldn't be a wise decision because I'd run out of money. The wings aren't dirt cheap and it's not really that expensive either considering we get big momma chicken wings. Compared to other places like Buffalo Wild Wings, the wings that Crisp has is definitely more expensive but MUCH more bigger. 4. And lastly I visited Crisp again yesterday after signing a lease with a friend, so we were like HEY! Let's spend our money and get some chicken. She hasn't been to Crisp before so I told her to look at the menu and see if she'd like anything. She wanted to get one of the Buddha bowls and I got the Seoul Sassy again. She liked her bowl but when I let her try my wings, she said she \"had an orgasm in her mouth.\" She definitely loves Crisp and since she's moving in the area with me, she's coming back for more for sure!So overall, the wings are amaaazing.

Three of us ordered the following: Original Bad Boy Buddha, half of the Plain Jane, and half of Crisp BBQ. I'm going to be completely honest, the Original Bad Boy Buddha and Plain Jane were just okay. \u00a0Granted, the Buddha was a different version of the Korean bimbimbop, but the three of us weren't impressed by it. \u00a0The Plain Jane was just okay, and we didn't really dive into it. \u00a0However, the Crisp BBQ had really good flavor, and we devoured it.Like I said, I guess I've been spoiled with NY korean friend chicken locations. The chicken at Crisp was WAY TOO greasy. \u00a0I know it sounds crazy, but the way the fried chicken is prepared at Kyochon, Bon Chon, Kyedong and UFC, there is HARDLY any grease. It's hard to believe, but until you try it, you'd understand. After eating a dozen, there are only some traces of grease. \u00a0However at Crisp, after eating the fried chicken, there was a thick layer of grease.My pros: Crisp BBQ had good flavor, service was FANTASTIC (no matter how busy, they would take the time to answer any questions; attentive and very polite), and the ambiance (I enjoyed the indoor picnic feel).", "Date": "2010-04-25", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Drew B.", "ReviewID": "WQTGZe2708CFJarlAvxI5A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After walking by a few times and always seeing it packed inside, I decided to try out Crisp today.

I picked up on the ginger and garlic, but I felt it was extremely sweet. The Crisp BBQ was extraordinary; I felt it had the right kick to sweetness ratio. I wish I had gotten only the BBQ. The Mini Buddha was delicious - a good mix of veggies to rice and was made even better with the chicken from the wings. On top of it was a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg.

While, I could have tried various new and exciting items such as the \"Buddha Bowl\" or their renown chicken wings in \"Seoul Sassy\" sauce, I opted for less adventurous option, the chicken burrito. Why? Well I was starving and it was familiar. The chicken burrito was \"meh.\" While it did have a unique peanut-esque type of flavor to it, it was overall dry and I was not very impressed. My boyfriend ordered the steak burrito and displayed the same level of enthusiasm towards it as I did my own dish. That and the communal table can be a pain in the rear. It really can ruin a dining experience when you sit literally next to two loud-mouthed white collar men yelling about \"corporate\" and one accidentally pulling off part of his shirt while removing his outerwear and exposing bodily hair to the unsuspecting viewer.That being said, I would be more than willing to try Crisp again and will certainly try something more unique and I am sure more palette-friendly.

The sauce was the perfect amount of spice where you taste the initial sweetness of the sauce and then it rounds out to a nice, but NOT overwhelming spicy end note. Again, as a non-wing eater I was really really impressed. To go with the wings we also went with the Baby Buddha Bowl. The vegetables were crisp and delicious.

I haven't seen corn in the Korean version (bibimbap)... well... ever... but that didn't stop me from devouring it - and liking it. \u00a0The gotchujang (red hot) sauce was far from spicy, and it was almost sweet, which left me a little disappointed \u00a0If they're going to advertise it as spicy sauce, they should give the patrons an option for real \"spicy\" sauce. \u00a0Of course, they should keep the spicy version behind the counter lest some Lakeview patron unknowingly burns a hole in his tongue thinking it's ketchup. \u00a0Buddha Bowl = 4.0 starsWings with Crisp BBQ Sauce - I believe they are trying to go for the Korean wing \"kkanpongi\" taste here, but it's been tamed down a little bit for the local tastebuds. \u00a0The Korean version is much spicier and contains more garlic. \u00a0This version at Crisp is good, but it could be better if it were a tad spicier and a little less salty. \u00a0But overall, I like it. \u00a0Crisp BBQ Sauce = 4.0 starsWings with Seoul Sassy Sauce- I'm not quite sure what to make of this.

Let's get one fact straight first, the way I heard it, when they opened, their flavors were Korean style. Once they realized business was crappy, they changed their flavors to accommodate American palates. I wish I'd tried it when they first opened I think I would've appreciated their flavors a lot more. These new flavors are bleh to me. I live on the North side where Korean food is within an arms reach. Seoul sassy was the only flavor that kind of appealed. The chicken was so very crispy, many times throughout the experience it was said over and over by all that I ate with. I wish they offered Soju, since I'm used to having Tong Dak with Soju at Korean bars. WTF is Northside pomme frites? It is NOT prepared like pomme frites, it's freakin' plain style French fries. That's it. I would've skipped the French fries had I known better. Their coleslaw, I'd hoped would be Korean style, it wasn't, it was like any coleslaw found anywhere, another wasted purchase. None of the sides were any appealing and the bowls were just bleh to me, as well. Like Luan N. mentioned, rice has an additional charge WTF? It's just sticky rice.. Brown rice ok, but sticky? The sides just don't make sense.. also at these Americanized joints, why do you have to charge for kim chi? EEssshhh 18!! If I happen in here again I think I'd try the chicken plain and maybe try a bul kogi burrito, cuz bul kogi is bangin' and not something anyone can F up. Fuck the fusion part, bring back the Korean style. I found this on the Internet so for some of you that care, you've got the Korean names of this style of chicken; \" There are the battered wings, served plain (Dak Nal Gae, \"chicken wings\") or brushed with garlic, soy, pepper, whatever sauce (Mae Woon Dak Nal Gae \"spicy chicken wings\").

The food was almost uniformly impeccable; enormous chicken wings were fried to an impossibly perfect crisp without tasting remotely greasy. The sauces were perfect accompaniments; the seoul sassy was my personal favorite, although the barbecue was perfectly spicy and sweet without being remotely cloying (as is sadly the case with many Asian and barbecue sauces). The buddha bowl was also a hit; the beef was delicious, the vegetables were all perfectly cooked (I never eat corn, but I made an exception for this), and the rice perfectly soaked up all their juices. Mexican cokes were a really nice perk. The one knock on the food at Crisp was the fried mushroom side dish, which was only so-so. Still, the rest of the food was fantastic, and our entire order (which in these circumstances fed two ravenous 20something males, but would probably have fed 4 normal people) came out under $40.

The Plain Jane- just as good as the Seoul Sassy, but I have to say the Seoul Sassy wins. It's something about the sauce! I get the whole chicken. I know people like the wings, but I like the variety of having different cuts of the chicken...white/dark.. you know? The bulgogi burrito with the atomic sauce- spicy mayo-ey sauce! Always ALWAYS ask for extra sauce! The burrito is filled with rice, carrots, lettuce, corn and bulgogi, wrapped in a nice tortilla. Now, since I try to stay healthy, I only share the burrito- it's huge anyways! And the fries.... *drool x2* I need to learn how to parallel park better.......", "Date": "2010-12-29", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Chrissy P.", "ReviewID": "c4moZ8Mrc6PsJQg-h9Dpyg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Crisp = awesome.

On the bi bim bap (or Buddha bowls, as they call them): the bi bim bap is supposed to be spicy and a little sweet. However, their sauce is extremely sweet and a little spicy. If you add a lot of it to make it spicier, then your food just becomes super sweet. Also, the other sauce with mayo is not a Korean sauce at all. I don't know why they have it there. The rice itself is somehow lacking as well, in a way I can't describe. On the presentation: It's terrible that they make you pay for your own side dishes. They don't promote the Korean dining experience at all. Korean dining is all about getting a well balanced meal and getting a ton of side dishes with your main entr\u00e9e. At least the kimchi should be free. Also, bi bim bap always traditionally comes with soy soup, which is similar to the Japanese miso soup. So yes, flavor is good, but you can have bi bim bap as good as this in other Korean restaurants in town (Cho Sun Ok or Sam Soo Gab San are my favorites) and get more for your money. If you're at Crisp for the chicken, you won't be able to get it at other Korean restaurants in town since it's specialized. The only other place I know that has it is Dak on Granville.

Being that I come from NYC, we have the likes of Bon Chon, Kyo Chon, Unidentified Flying Chickens, and Mad For Chicken. Crisp has high standards to live by, and because of this, I was intrigued to see if they can live up to their competition on the East Coast.The ambiance is simple, with 3 large picnic-sized communal tables. You order at the back, wait for your name to be called and eat at one the 3 large communal tables. If you like your privacy, I recommend taking it on the go, but you risk the chance of the wings not being as fresh and crispy.For our first visit here, we ordered the 10 piece whole jumbo wings ($15.95) with Seoul Sassy sauce, touted as a sweet sauce consisting of ginger, soy, garlic and spices. We also ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl ($6.95) with beef (extra $1.00), and a side of their Superfly Frites (Small - $2.25). In about 8 minutes, my name was called and my tray of wings and fries were waiting to be picked up. The Baby Buddha Bowl wasn't ready for another 5 minutes, but one of the staff members were nice enough to bring it over to us.The Korean fried chicken indeed lived up to its name. It was perfectly crisp, sort of like a twice-fried crispy french fry vs. a soggy once-fried french fry. The meat inside the legs and wings were so juicy and tender. Thank goodness for dark meat. But that Seoul Sassy sauce really took it over the top, sweet, savory, salty, with a subtle spiciness. No flavor overwhelmed the other, making for a well-balanced palate pleaser that had my taste buds jumping up and down. Crisp's fried chicken may not be as good as some of their New York City counterparts, but they make one darn good delicious wing that is a must try, especially for those that have never had Korean fried chicken. The french fries were fairly standard, extra crispy on the outside, though not very potatoey inside. They were good, but definitely didn't much for me. The Baby Buddha Bowl is where things fell apart. It is touted as a mini adaptation of a traditional Korean dish called bimbimbap, but it was so very far from that. It was not served in a hot stone ceramic pot that it is usually served in and there was no sizzle factor. The texture of the rice sort of felt like it came right out of the rice pot with no crispiness whatsoever. The fried egg and vegetables (spinach, bean sprouts, carrots and zucchini) were spread on top in bimbimbap fashion, but when mixed together, none of the ingredients really seemed to complement each other to make for a tasty concoction. It left for a rather timid dish that felt like the ingredients were carelessly thrown in a dish and claimed as bimbimbap. The Korean hot sauce, called Gochujang, which is better known as a Korean red chili bean paste, was not spicy at all. Even tasting it alone, brought barely any heat to my tongue. For any avid bimbimbap fans, I'd avoid the baby buddha at all costs, at it leaves nothing to be desired. After 3-4 bites, we wound up throwing away the rest.One of the cashiers I had ordered from was also especially rude. When I put in the order for the Jumbo Wings, he looked at me as if I were stupid and asked me impolitely in one way or another, \"You gonna tell me what sauce? or what?\" And as I was paying, he took a phone call. He ran my credit card and handed it back to me. I was waiting for a receipt but didn't want to be rude and interrupt his call, but he gave me a look and motioned for me to move over so the next customer can order.Crisp definitely does serve some delicious Korean fried chicken that is a must-try, especially for the uninitiated. For that I would give them 5 stars, but because I'm comparing it to some of their NYC competition, I'll give it 4 stars. But their fries and Buddha Bowls can easily be overlooked. I really can't believe how wrong they seemed to get the bimbimbap and why they would even bother putting it on the menu, but apparently quite a few people in the restaurant seemed to be eating it and loving it. And last but not least was their rude service, which really left me in a somewhat bothered state when I left Crisp.

The following Saturday I decided to give it another go because of all the rave reviews I've heard. - I've had my fair share of Korean food and chicken wings of all sorts in my life time, but I'm sorry these wings weren't impressive. I had the Crisp BBQ and the Seoul Sassy sauces. The Crisp BBQ sauce is basically the red chili paste sauce from bibimbop with some added smoky flavors. The Seoul Sassy sauce was alright - nothing crazy. I didn't appreciate the pool of frying OIL the wings were sitting in -- not appetizing. The meat on the wings was half tender and half dry/hard. Probably could be prevented if the wingette and drumette were separated before fried.- I will admit the size of these wings are fairly bigger than your typical buffalo style wings. I have left overs that I don't want to eat. - I will pass on this restaurant and stick to the authentic Korean restaurants, Thai angel wings, and Great Sea's wings (on Lawrence and my fave). btw, dol sot bibimbap is 100% better than your plain bibimbap.

And it is awesome (the chicken wing shack, that is). While you can eat inside at the 3 or 4 very practical picnic-style tables, really you're here just to chow down on some good wings, not for a restaurant-style experience. Like many people, I LOVE wings, and after experiencing wings at Crisp, I'm completely ruined for your run-of-the-mill buffalo wings. I've been here 3 times and twice for take-out, and the food has been consistently amazing. After some experimenting, my vote goes for the Seoul Sassy and the Mild Buffalo wings. Get ready to be punched in the mouth with flavor! Also, note that these wings are basically full-size wings, so for the price, it's pretty great. One thing my friends have compared this place to is Great Seas, another Asian restaurant known for their Korean-style wings. I decided to go and compare, and after the amazingness of Crisp, I was left slightly disappointed. Great Seas wings are really good, and still tastier than regular buffalo wings, but they don't offer as much of a selection of flavors, and their wings are much smaller than Crisp's.Conclusion: Best wings in Chicago!

I've been here many times and the food and service are consistently great. The staff, Jae (owner) and Jon, are really nice guys and very helpful. The wings are, in my humble opinion, the best in the city. They're huge, meaty, and the sauces are delicious. Five wings are probably enough to make most people full, but I usually order 10 pieces and split them between my two favorite sauces, Seoul Sassy and BBQ. The wings are a must have, but if you want to try something else, ask Jon at the counter because he knows the menu backwards and forwards, and will give you an honest recommendation based on your preferences. With Jon's help, I soon branched out and tried many of their other items. The \"Bad Boy Buddha\" bi bim bop is fantastic. The vegetables are fresh and plentiful, and if you're a meat-eater like me, I recommend trying it with beef. One of the complaints that I noticed from other reviewers was their surprise that this dish was not served hot. These reviewers don't realize that this is SUPPOSED to be served at ROOM temperature. Although I would probably recommend that Jae revise the menu to mention this in the description, as most people probably aren't that familiar with Korean cuisine. Jon also insisted that I order the \"smashed\" potatoes with shaved carrots mixed in, and simply described them as \"awesome.' He was right again, the potatoes were thick and creamy, and the carrots added a nice flavor and color to what normally looks very bland.

I loved the atmosphere, long communal tables, with great choices of beverages from the cooler (both Asian inspired and American classics). I chose the Green Tea with Black Tea, Barley, and White Tea. It was un-sweetened and full of antioxidants, nice and refreshing. For lunch, I took the Korean beef burrito with brown rice substitute to go. The burrito itself was huge, think Chipotle huge, and full of freshly prepared ingredients and tons of beef pilled high. The only downside was that the burrito itself was extremely sweet, and while I know most Korean beef is prepared this way, it was almost sickly sweet like a dessert. I was expecting it to be just a little bit more savory. The sauce placed on the side gave it a bit more kick and balanced things out a bit, according to my bf. My only other critique of Crisp is that there menu is a bit small with only about 3-4 choices underneath each category, but they do have a store front location on Broadway, and it's not really a sit down place.

I would just give 2. We went during dinner time on Friday. It is so stressful. The place is small. It is hard to get a seat. The food takes a long time to be ready, given how casual they are. There are constantly dirty courier guys walk in and out for deliveries. I came from Hong Kong. I do not mind chaotic eateries, as long as the food is worth it. I don't know if the food is worth it. First of all, there is nothing Asian about the fried chicken wings. It is any American fried chicken wings with lots of sauce. My husband thinks the wings are fine, thus the 3 star, not 2. We also ordered Seoul Steak Bowl: not Asian again. The rice is a bit too dry. The meat is not fatty, i.e. not authentic. Fine, it is catering to the American taste, where people cannot take any meat with a little fat in it. I would also prefer at least some vegetable in it.

We ordered a half chicken of the Seoul Sassy, a half chicken of the Crisp BBQ, and a small buddha bowl with beef. The wings were just as amazing as everyone has said. My favorite was the Seoul Sassy. I didn't realize that a half chicken order was literally a half of a chicken. (I thought it was half an order of wings...guess I should read the menu more clearly next time!) So I definitely will be ordering just the wings next time. But the flavors were definitely delicious! I also enjoyed the small buddha bowl. I looove the bean sprouts that are included in the bowl. They're my favorite thing to eat at Korean restaurants. The beef had a delicious flavor as well.

Saw that Yahoo rated them the best fried chicken in the country. And I'm Asian, so I figure an Asian twist on fried chicken should be good, right? Well, I've been there twice now and I am sorry but I just don't get it. It's very bony, greasy, fried chicken. The sauces are not particularly memorable, and I've tried both. Over $10 for a half chicken (and that's the smallest fried chicken order you can get, I even asked if I could get less than the 6 piece half chicken order and they told me no because it would screw up their inventory). Oh, and when I think of a half chicken, I'm thinking I'm going to get half a chicken, meaning that I would get ONE leg, One wing, One breast, etc., Somehow my half chicken had 2 wings, 2 legs, and 1 breast and 1 other indistinguishable piece. Interesting interpretation of what \"half a chicken\" is, my half has 2 legs and 2 wings? The eat in area is tiny and the atmosphere is for a dive-y kind of place that should charge far less. Don't get me wrong, I LIKE dive-y places, if the food is good and the price is right. This place has you squished in picnic tables that you share with others with a big roll of paper towels that you share with everyone else, and I paid over $10 for my bony fried chicken.", "Date": "2011-06-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jeff K.", "ReviewID": "RBBe8aJu4xaWQqYzc8_bWg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Overall, the experience was dissapointing because the food was not special. \u00a0I don't care about sitting at picnic tables but can look past such frivolity if the food is outstanding. \u00a0I read a large number of overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site and apparently this place won best fried chicken in Chicago 2008. \u00a0So I went there on a Friday night, steady but not too busy. \u00a0I ordered the Plain Jane, it is their most basic dish. \u00a0Ordering a basic dish serves as a great indicator to gauge the quality of the ingredients, crappy places disguise low quality and poor execution with sweet or excessively spicy sauces. \u00a0The chicken arriced after about 10 minutes. \u00a0It looked crispy and smelled good. \u00a0However, the flavoring was non-existent and the chicken was saw dust dry. \u00a0I noticed a million sauces surrounding me but why should I smother my chicken in some insidious sauce to make it taste good? \u00a0I tried the sauce anyway, tasted good but not what I expected.
