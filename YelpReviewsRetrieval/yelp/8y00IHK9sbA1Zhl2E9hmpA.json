It has such a old school feel to it. Free parking with validation next to the restaurant. It gets full so might have to wait for a spot.It was annoying at first because all the servers were running around doing a million things and I could not get anyones attention to take my order. I didn't want to raise my hand wave someone down like a fool. Greg ended up at my table. He was awesome! Had wonderful service with him.I had a Groupon, $10 for $20. Yelp check in gives you free Chocolate Chp Rugula.- Fresser - $15.50 - I think the Fresser is the perfect offering. I am the type to want to try multiple different things a restaurant is popular for in one dish. Fresser offers, both popular meats, corned beef and pastrami and both sides, cole slaw and potato salad. Corned beef and pastrami portions were huge! It literally was piled high. Both meats were well flavored and seasoned and cooked perfectly. Potato salad was top notch. I loved the apple, it added a nice sweet crisp crunch. Cole Slaw was plain and simple alone. I put it in the sandwich because the meat and bread alone was to dry for me and it was delicious.- Avocado, Mushroom And Swiss Omelet - $7 - Breaskfast special price before 10:30 am everyday. One of the best omelets I have ever had! Huge and super cheesy! It was stuffed with mushroom and avocado. Usually restaurant barely give you any but I had a bunch of toppings with each bite, so BOMB! You also get a bagel, hashbrowns, and a drink. You probably cannot find a breasfast deal this good anywhere!- Matzo Ball Soup - $6.75 - HOLY SOFTBALL SIZED MATZO BALL! This thing was huge! I never had a matzo ball before but this was delish! It has the taste and texture of a dumpling. I had to add a dash of pepper with each bite. The soup was amazing. Such good deep chicken flavor and not salty at all. The crispy bagels that it comes with are so good dip in the soup or by themselves. I would crave for this if I was sick.- Chocolate Chp Rugula - Free with Yelp Check In - Very tasty pastry. Full of chocolate chips. Dipped in coffee, it was very good!Sad to see such a low rating for an LA landmark.

In other words, Canter's in a definitive Hollywood experience not to be missed.Deli is never cheap, but Canter's prices are actually a little bit lower than some others. And they have a half a deli sandwich and a bowl of soup special that is very reasonable, delicious, and filling. Canter's is also one of the last places to offer Kishke with gravy, and also Kreploch soup. If you like \"old\" pickles then that's the way they serve them. I like new pickles myself but they are hard to get. Also at Canter's you have to buy a side of the green tomatoes, they are not free as with most other places. I love the pastrami here, on rye (nice and chewy), but the corned beef is also great, probably their signature dish. The Matzo ball soup is good but it is not huge. Specialty sandwiches are also tasty like the Danny Thomas or the Marilyn Monroe. Whatever you have I recommend having it with a black cherry soda. It pairs well.Other fare include the Mish Mosh soup, a huge bowl of everything starchy (Matzo ball, noodles, Kreploch, chicken meat, and carrots) all in chicken soup. Also hot beef and hot turkey sandwiches with mashed potatoes and gravy. And if you want a full dinner, with appetizers and sides, they have quite a few of these too.Don't miss the excellent home baked pastries and a cup of coffee after the meal. You can go pick out what you want at the bakery counter.Canter's also offers a take out deli where you can but things by the lb, and a bakery.

I don't live near this deli by any means but when I'm in the area and in the mood for a good sandwich, I make my way over to Canter's. I've had both the pastrami and the corned beef sandwiches and haven't been disappointed! At $12, it might seem pricy but they stack the finely sliced meat nice and high in between two slices of fresh rye bread and offer a side of cole slaw or potato salad. During my most recent visit to Canter's, I couldn't decide between the pastrami and the corned beef sandwich so I opted for the Canter's Fairfax sandwich which stacks corned beef on top of delicious pastrami. Once again, I wasn't disappointed. We got some pastries on our way out and picked up a big black & white cookie, a few chocolate macaroons, and an apple strudel. I liked all of them! They were made fresh and weren't too sweet.My overall experience was great. The restaurant is old fashioned with a relaxed atmosphere. The service is efficient and our waitress was very nice.

We walked inside, and was taken back 50 years in time. \u00a0Talk about vintage!! \u00a0We walked up to the sign that said \"WAIT TO BE SEATED\" with a red arrow pointed to a line. \u00a0So, we waited, and waited... a few waitstaff dropped off some menus, but not one said \"someone will be with you\". \u00a0We finally get seated in one of the vintage looking booths and the woman plops down 2 menus and a \"cocktail\" menu.Another man sets our table and gives us 2 dinky water glasses (despite the sign that says \"water served upon request\"). \u00a0We wait and wait for someone to take our drink order. Finally \"Penny\", an older lady, comes by and plops a plate of pickles and disappears. \u00a0She does come back a few minutes later for our drink order, and then disappears. \u00a0Meanwhile, while waiting for Penny to reappear, we checked into \"Yelp\" and saw if you check in you get an order of chocolate chip rugula. \u00a0I stopped Penny and showed her the app, and she brought back a plate of 5 rugulas. Score! Best check in deal in a long time!She finally comes back to take our order. I order the 1/2 classic sandwich (comes with a small side of potato salad or slaw) and a bowl of matzo soup (adding noodles cost extra) and also a side of onion rings. \u00a0Stephen ordered the 1/2 sandwich and matzo soup, no noodles.The soup came out immediately. \u00a0I wish she waited so we could have our soup with the sandwich, but oh well... I was famished, and started in on the soup. \u00a0The matzo was a good size ball, but was just the soup and matzo. No carrots, noodles, or anything else. \u00a0It did come with a small plate of bagel chips.I was about done with my soup when the 1/2 sandwich came. The sandwich was not a NYC \"sky high\" sandwich, but the portion was ok. \u00a0I don't think it was worth the price we paid, but its sliced fresh, and the meat was lean and tender. \u00a0I debated if I should wait for my onion rings but I figure at the rate they bring out food, my hot sandwich would get cold. \u00a0Lucky I didn't wait. \u00a0The onion rings never came. \u00a0I waited for Penny to refill on my drink, but had to flag another server to get her. \u00a0When she arrived, we asked for the refill, the check, and \u00a0I told her to cancel the onion rings as I was done with my lunch.She had a surprised look on her face, as in \"Oh My! I can't believe I forgot about your o-rings\", but honey, you were too busy chatting with your fellow servers, I'm not surprised you remembered I was sitting in your station.The food was good, but the service was subpar, even by LA standards. \u00a0Canter's is open 24 hours for your dining pleasure. \u00a0Good thing I had a Groupon, but its stil not a cheap place to eat.", "Date": "2014-06-30", "Author_Location": "Fullerton, CA"}, {"Author": "Travis W.", "ReviewID": "hZX5DnJeaOqnzK_FXTBUtg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Oh the history alone is worth 3 stars. A very classic and famous deli with one of the darkest bars I have ever seen in my life. This place is a piece of LA history. I finally got it off my list of places to check out thanks to a buddy forcing me to go here. The menu is chalked full of different items that pretty much can cover anything you could want from a restaurant. Now looking at the menu I had to go with a sandwich, how could you not? \u00a0I was torn between the pastrami and the brisket. My wife grabbed a corn beef Brooklyn on sourdough (should have asked for it toasted) and I grabbed the brisket dip. The sandwiches are nice in size and will definitely fill you up. \u00a0My dip was pretty darn good, nice flavor from the beef and the au jus was perfect. Nice and salty to and complimented the flavors. The prices here are pretty much $10.00 and above but the portions are pretty nice so it kind of evens it out. You can grab a bottle of beer or they have about 6 taps if you want a draft. The ambiance is really cool with old pics of G&R and a killer drawing that Slash did of Aerosmith.

One side leads straight into the bakery & deli while the other straight into the restaurant (but still not where you wait to get a table). In the bar area (also where the bathrooms are), there are several TVs where you can catch a game. Be careful when going into the ladies' room. It's TINY and the sink is literally right next to the door. If you don't open carefully, you can hit another patron! Talk about unsafe! If the private parking lot for Canter's is full, you'll have to find street metered parking (yes, you have to pay on Sundays). The place very popular so the lot gets filled quickly. When we walked in, we came through the restaurant entrance. Little did we know that you're supposed to go through the bakery/deli entrance. There were no signs posted by the restaurant entrance to go through the other side. Throughout our meal, we constantly saw people walking in and making the same mistake that we did. Gives off a bad impression when you're standing waiting to get seating and you're being completely ignored by all the employees, only to be finally told that the wait-line is at the other side. We were lucky and came when there was a lull in customers and we were seated within 10min.Order:Belgium Waffle Special: ($12.50) Belgian Waffle, One Egg, choice of two pieces of bacon or sausage, and hash-browns.Smoked Salmon (Lox) Benedict: ($12.25) served with Potatoes, Tomatoes, Cottage Cheese, or Fresh Fruit. Served on Potato Pancakes (+$2)The Deli: ($10.95) Pastrami, Corned Beef or Salami, Eggs, Potatoes, and ToastChocolate Phosphate: $2.50Coffee: $2.50They brought out complimentary pickles that didn't have the nice snap/crunch as you bite into it. The pickles also didn't have the a sharp tartness. We left nearly two plates full of pickles behind (felt so bad but I couldn't even finish one!).I had the Belgium Waffle Special (and even though on the menu it says it comes with coffee or tea, they said they stopped doing it. Another place with false advertising which I hate). The waffle was slightly crispy on the outside and \u00a0airy on the inside. Apparently there's only two waffle makers so when our table ordered three of the Belgium Waffle Specials, the waitress told us that the workers nearly freaked out. Makes me wonder how they fair during really busy times.. =/ I like my eggs poached but mine was over-done. Sadness. The sausages tasted how they looked, over-cooked.I've had pastrami from Katz's Delicatessen in NY so other delis have some major work to impress me now. I took a bite from my sister's pastrami sandwich and thought it wasn't as juicy (could be that the slices are thinner) or flavorful compared to Katz's. Makes me want to go back to NY to get my fix! ^^;;I was debating on either the Chocolate Phosphate or the Chocolate Egg Cream as they're both fairly uncommon to find. Both tastes like chocolate soda, one is just slightly creamier than the other. Egg Cream is a drink with milk, soda water, and either vanilla or chocolate syrup. Typically very popular in the Brooklyn area. A chocolate Phosphate on the other hand is chocolate syrup with acid phosphate and soda/mineral water. I opted for the phosphate as of the two, I see it even less on menus. The Chocolate Phosphate came with another glass of mineral water which is a nice gesture but really waters down the chocolate flavor as you add to the drink. =/I didn't have the coffee but my sister's bf did and he said it was really strong. This is coming from a coffee drinker with a minimum of one cup in the morning to get going for the day. He couldn't finish two cups because it got him jittery.Our waitress was cordial and got waters or coffee refilled when needed. We didn't need much besides that so service was decent.When having to pay, you have to bring you ticket back to where you waited to get in. The lady there was very cranky and looked like she didn't want to be there at all. Again, not a very welcoming place.If I ever came back, it'd be for the Belgium waffle and either the chocolate phosphate/egg cream.

It's been nearly 2 years since I moved to LA, and because I had yet to come here, my thoroughly LA-acquainted buddy thought it prudent to bring me.They do have quite a bit to choose from on the menu, but their claim to fame is their Pastrami on Rye. Although I'm not typically a fan of rye bread, I felt a pressing obligation to order it as is, and I must say I was pleasantly satisfied. The meat is towering, and is seasoned with simplicity yet charm. The bread is fresh, the rye seeds contrasting nicely with the saltiness of the meat. I loaded it with deli mustard, sealing its destiny.Fulfilling our pastrami obligation, we additionally ordered a reuben sandwich to share, which comes with corned beef on pressed rye, further adorned with swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian sauce. As far as taste, I personally felt the reuben overpowered the plainer (and slightly drier) pastrami. The meat was more moist, and the cheese-kraut-beef made for a nice trifecta. Still glad I tried them both, though.The fries were thick and potato-ey; the cole slaw was good, just a tick above average.We closed with some chocolate chip rugula and a black & white cookie, both of which were excellent texture- and taste-wise, and wafting with deli freshness.The table next to us ordered a Matzah Ball Soup, which looked humongous. I could only taste it with my eyes, but I made a mental note to order it next time.Service is great. Parking's a synch. Open 24 hours. Don't forget that in addition to their famous pastrami, they also have a great selection of desserts and deli foods, making this more than just a tourist spot you try once. The variety means you can come back for more and more and enjoy yourself each time.I give the famous pastrami sandwich itself 4 stars, but add to that the historic charm and variety of deli desserts, as well as 24-hour availability, I give the full experience 4.75 stars. Bottom line: Canter's puts the deli in delicious.Recommended Dish: Get the pastrami, but if you can, split it and a corned beef with a friend.

A friend of mine and I went and were sat in the middle section where there are 6 booths and when it's slow usually assigned to one waitress.When we were seated, the waitress Gina was helping the booth in front of us and the booth across from us was also occupied with delightful seniors finishing their evening. Gina finished with the table in front of us, turned to the table of seniors and asked if they needed anything else. She didn't look at us or in any way acknowledge us. About 6-8 minutes later (of being completely ignored), the section started to fill and another couple was seated diagonally from us, she attended to them and got them beverages and took their orders. (We still couldn't get her attention or any service) Two more groups were seated and attended to. Finally, Brian (I believe was his name) came to our booth and began taking our order. I expressed to him that Gina didn't in any way acknowledge we were sitting there and served THREE other booths that arrived quite a bit after we did. He said that he was there now to assist, which I thanked and acknowledged him for but that I was very displeased with being outright ignored. We wouldn't have gotten water if it had not been for the bus boy we were able to flag down. Ultimately, I don't know if Gina was just having a bad day, or disliked serving mixed race tables. It was wrong and could have been handled in a more professional manner. She easily could have said, \"Another server will be with you shortly\" as soon as we were seated instead of just out right ignoring a table in her section.

I went to Langer's a couple years ago when I heard about the great Jewish deli tradition in LA and was pleased, so I decided to make it a point to try the equally important historical delis in the area.The decor and vibe is as cool as it gets. Old school NY deli vibe, but with a diner flare that only the west coast can provide (since we have more physical space). It's important to note that this old school vibe is not tacky, nor is it like walking into a dusty mausoleum. The place is not old, rather, it is classic, meaning they have faithfully preserved the fundamental character of the place, while still maintaining a modern restaurant.Food: The pickles are spot on. Crisp with just the right amount of spice. I had the Brooklyn ave. w/ corned beef and potato salad, while my guest had a pastrami Reuben w/ fries. My sandwich hit all the right notes---corned beef, slaw, Russian dressing, Jewish rye. I had a couple bites of the Reuben and was equally as pleased. The potato salad has an interesting sweet side to it that contrasts really well with the smoke of the meat and bite of the dressing and pickles.

I wanted the Tuna Melt but they don't make it as a combo so I did the Tuna Salad sandwich instead. The tuna salad was a bit dry. It was missing something. I just can't put my finger on what it needed. Maybe mayo? Maybe mustard?I got the Matzo Ball soup with it and the ball was huge (that's what she sure did say!). And soooo delicious. My friend who isn't normally a fan of soup helped me tear it up!He got the Reuben and it was pretty damn good. Not as big as DZ Akins make them, but still pretty flavorful.Since I checked in on Yelp we got the Chocolate Chip Rugulas for free. They brought out four and they were damn good! I ate two before he was able to put them on the table.Lastly, (I know we actually ate more), we shared a Banana Split. A waitress made it earlier and basically sold one as soon as she walked by.

I explained that it was all about her \"reading\" comment....and the fact my eggs were cold.\"Can I talk now?\" she replied, coldly. She attempted to show me the menu (again), to which I replied, \"who's your boss?\"Turns out it's Mark Canter...or a dude named Terry. \"Neither one is here right now.\" I got on the phone while my friends ate, called the restaurant, and immediately spoke with Mark. You know...the one who wasn't there. After I told him what just went down, he was at my table in maybe 30 seconds. And he acted appropriately. He apologized, offered free desert, removed the items from the bill...and took off some more from the bill. He also explained that our waitress had 31 years under her belt, is about to retire, and \"can act that way sometimes. As can our managers.\"I wish this had a happy ending. As some of you may know, there's two lines as you're about to pay your bill: cash and credit. I didn't know this. I was standing back from the line maybe five feet when another manager asked me to step up and pay. And she asked if I was paying with cash or credit. I said credit, to which she said (rudely), \"then get into the right line.\" \"Um...which line?\" I asked.She pointed to to signs hanging from the ceiling. \"Can you read the signs?\" she asked.Yea. No joke. Then Mark walked up. I told him what just happened...AFTER what I had just been though. He laughed. \"That's the mother of the manager you just complained about.\"I told him I didn't think it was funny.I still don't.Here's an idea: travel up Fairfax to Sunset, make a left, and eat at Greenblatt's.

I don't know if they are under we ownership/management or WHAT, but the quality of food had seriously slacked. In the hay days I would have rated Canter's 5-star without hesitation. I always came for the matzah ball soup. This time, the soup was barely warm and SO bland. There was no flavor to the broth at ALL. It was literally like sipping tinted water. When I used to order the soup they would have a sprig of dill as well. I saw the dill in the bowl of soup of someone sitting near me. When I asked the waitress for dill she said there was none.Ugh.The broccoli cheddar stuffed baked potato was flavorful, but very dry. Needed butter or sour cream, which I couldn't ask for because our waitress went on break and very other waitress failed to notice/acknowledge my trying to gain their attention. By the time out server came back from break, I was finished with my dry potato so there was no need to ask her.I decided to order dessert (regular cheesecake) and when it came to my table there was a dead flea stuck to the frosting. The waitress looked at it and confirmed it was a bug, apologized and offered to bring me a different piece. Thanks, but no thanks.(My BF got the Lil brisket panini (#3) and enjoyed it.)Now for the service part (aside from the lack of attention). As We approached the counter to pay, a lady was storming off shouting \"THIS IS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! What a horrible way to handle a customer!\" I smiled at the counter lady and we joked about how upset the lady was.........if only I knew! I showed the lady at the counter my Groupon voucher ($20 for $45 worth of food for four) she refused to accept it.I will admit fault in that I didn't happen to notice that the voucher stated \"for four\". We were a party of 2.My total came to $41, meaning that still actually had $4 worth of value leftover that was not being used. The lady at the counter still refused to take my groupon since there were only 2 ppl in our party. I explained that I had made a mistake, but asked if it were possible to still honor it since I had 1) already paid for the groupon and could not refund it and 2) I hadn't even used the FULL value that I had paid for.The counter lady rudely told me no and made no effort to even pretend that she cared. I asked her what the problem was, being that I payed the full amount for the voucher and she simply replied \"because there aren't 4 ppl\". The lady standing next to her looked fed up with he coworker's attitude and sympathetic towards us.Although I did misread the terms, there was no reason for them to not honor my voucher.

The time seems to stop here since they opened (I believe long long time ago). I love the classy sign outside. You feel the history. Decor is very classy (see my pics) and casual. They have a very high ceiling on the seating area.They're BIG. So they have several entrances. Bakery section on the left side of restaurant - pastries on the left, and deli on the right side. There's a sign for \"Wait here for dine-in\" in the middle of bakery. They have 2 huge seating areas - one in front of the sign, and the other on the right. On the far right side of restaurant, there's a very dark bar (by bathroom). It's so dark and you see only the lights from TVs... Kinda scary and too divey for me. The staff were charming. Clientele is well over 40s. 30 min free parking with the validation if you bought something at Deli. 1.5 hrs for dine in. It's hard to find a parking spot around here.Pastries: Very old fashioned. You can find all kinds of \"classy\" sweets here (See my pics). - Gluttony Expedition - Poppy seed Strudel : This stuffing is way too sweet and too dry. They cut the long pie for the size you want. It was $2 or so. It was pretty cheap. It's kinda like a \"baklava\". But I'm sorry - I'm so spoiled by Japanese pastries in Japan, which are the best in the world! One bite, I'm done.

Quizzno's...So imagine my surprise when I went to SoCal this past weekend for a proposal to hear about the legendary Pastrami Sandwich at Canter's. It was probably 11PM, really late, and in this neighborhood in LA that I thought I'd be shot in. The streets were lit up by people blowing their cigarette smoke in my face, and by people yapping at random people. I initially thought that the sandwich wasn't worth it -- I was drunk, hungry, and my contacts were getting dry.

After taking another bite I asked my daughter, what did she think? She stated that the sandwich didn't have any taste or flavor. At that time I separated the two meats, smelled and tasted them separately and came to the conclusion that neither of the two meats had any identifying signature smells between the two. In other words, the Cornbeef nor the Pastrami could not be identified by smell or taste, only by look.And to top it off, the Pickles were old, soft, rubbery and limp. Maybe because they were pre-wrapped and stacked a mile high on the counter, and not cut fresh like before. What a sad sandwich and pickle. The last time I complained about a sandwich was about seven years ago, when you cut the proportions of the meat down. I have never returned anything to Canters. And when I did this time I was browbeaten and verbally attacked by some crude lady named Eva.She told me \"Hell no, you I took more than one bite out of the sandwich.\" \u00a0At that point, it didn't make any difference what I said to this lady as she was making faces and negative body gestures.

I don't see how you could go wrong with hardly anything on the menu. I went with my cousin for the first time recently, and ordered the half sandwich and soup combo--pastrami on rye and a cup of chicken noodle soup. The sandwich was so yummy, and very filling, so it was plenty in spite of only being half. My cousin ordered the tongue sandwich on egg challah and a cup of cabbage soup, which is good too. We split the mac n cheese with added bacon on top- which was the absolute highlight of the meal, and some of the best mac n cheese I've had to date. Also, the pickles here are to die for--fresh, crispy perfection. I returned back and had what I would recommend as my favorite sandwich so far-- the \"Little Corned Beef Panini\"--oh.em.gee. It was delectable--perfectly tender corned beef on rye, panini style, with melted Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and cole slaw ON THE SANDWICH. My mouth waters just thinking about it. Canter's also has a bakery and deli counter on site, for some to-go items, including made-to-order deli sandwiches. I am already looking forward to returning and trying some other items.

The guys here don't skimp on the good stuff and you'll leave feeling blissful.Egg creams? Yes, please. If you don't know what one is, get one. Don't worry; there are no eggs in here. Just a little seltzer, milk, choco syrup and magic. As far as I know, this is the only place to get a good egg cream ( or an egg cream) in LA. Yolo. I love bread. I love breakfast. I love challah. I'm essentially in a committed relationship with their challah french toast ( don't tell my mother). you'll finish your plate and be challahing back for more. Was that funny? I laughed.Also, the pastry case. don't even. Don't even. \u00a0Everything in this case essentially taste the same but in a very good way. \u00a0Please, you'll know when you get there. Get half a pound of butter cookies, a few mini black and white cookies, and some rugelach. You won't regret it. Also, ask for pickles. Everyone needs a little nosh before their meal comes.Canter's is a deli. The ambiance is well... indicative of a deli?

Don't forget to buy a t-shirt!and the service? Again, it's a deli. The servers are sometimes friendly but typically just want you to eat and move your patoot out the door. c'est la vie.Canter's is pricey. Every single time I get my bill, I am a little shocked with how much my meal cost. So yes, I can prepare my own lox and shmear at my house but given that I deactivated my Jdate account, I've got like thirty jbucks to burn a month without guilt so my moolah issues with this place are no mo.

That was an extremely inappropriate and uncalled for comment!\"The waiter then apologized for his \"sense of humor\" and quickly ran away, appearing again moments later with water and pickles for us, and sensing the disgust oozing off our table, offered another apology.A few moments later, our server appeared. A nice enough fellow, except that he very obviously hates. his. life. And, in turn, hated us for being a part of it. Anyway...Right after we placed our order, a chirpy British lady we assumed to be the manager, came over to apologize for the wait, informed us that our new surly server came on early just to help, and offered to bring us some complementary cookies suggesting we \"save room for desert!\" She had obviously been informed of our wait but not of our exchange with the first server we spoke with.Look, our food came out quick and was pretty good. And we're a fun bunch, we managed to turn an unfortunate incident into a quirky story and enjoy ourselves, but that waiters comment....I'm hard pressed to think of a time I've experienced anything so blatantly racist in my life. \u00a0If you want good deli, do yourself a favor and skip this place in favor of Factor's Famous Deli or take a drive up to the Beverly Glenn Deli.

Although they were a bit busy, the service was at first very pushy (which we hate as my husband likes to drink his beer before start eating), we ordered French fries to munch on so he could have his time. The problem was that after bringing the fries, was almost impossible to get our server's attention again. A lady finally came when we were already losing our patience and wrote our order in a paper napkin. My husband ordered another beer, I ordered the Roast Brisket and my husband ordered the Chicken Milanese.10 minutes went by and the beer never came. We had to complain and the answer was \"The Bar is packed, our manager had to go get it!\", really???? The lady (the same who took our order) came back with the beer, no clean glass thought. Fine, we were trying to save the rest of our night, so we waited for the food. When it came, what a deception! My Brisket was overcook, I got to say that it was not roast, but tasted boiled instead, with tons of thick cut onion gravy over it, the mashed potatoes was from those potato mix, not real potato, super dry and with a weird looking gravy over it. Super sloppy presentation, the kind that does not inspire you to eat whatsoever! As I was hungry and it was way too late (after midnight already) I ate the dry overcooked brisket and did not touch the mash or the onions.My husband's Chicken Milanese was to come with fries and salad, the salad did not come and when my husband asked the server, she was absolutely lost, my husband had to show her the menu in order to get her to go get the salad. The chicken was also overcooked, super dry, and the breading tasted almost burned.At the register, they do not charge you while seated, you have to go to the cashier to pay (really?!?) the guy asked about our experience, my husband tells him and surprise, he blame on the server, who had put the blame on the hostess.... and life goes on.... Besides the mess, the not so clean dinner room, pretty old and not inviting ambiance, the server was nice and apologized many times, even giving us pastries for dessert, which \u00a0we brought home, I have to say that the fries and the pastries were super good, but other than that, I have no intention whatsoever of going back to Canters.

Bless that lady. One time a homeless guy came up to us just after we got our food and he asked my boyfriend for his food, so my boyfriend gave the homeless guy half his sandwich. The waitress saw that exchange and she had the kitchen make my bf another half a sandwich and wrap it to go, which was really nice but unnecessary -- even half a sandwich from Canters is a more than full meal for someone with a reasonable appetite.Also, they frequently have live music and other things (want some open mic night with your tuna salad?) in the bar, which is sorta fun.

So when I saw a 'Groupon' special $22 for $12 for Canter's I figured it was worth a visit. My girlfriend and I decided we would have lunch/dinner and drove from the South Bay to West L.A. very quickly. We arrived and were able to find 'free' parking in the Canter's lot just adjacent to the Delicatessen. Once you park you are given a ticket and when 'validated' parking is free. My girlfriend and I walked inside and I am not sure what I was expecting to expect. I was told many years ago by my mother never trust a restaurant that is open '24 hours a day' they can never truly clean it. This theory always made sense to me and still does. I did not notice that upon walking in Canter's didn't really smell like anything, it didn't have an intoxicating smell, it is just smelled 'bland.' My girlfriend and I sat down and the staff (i.e. waitress, busboy) all very extremely nice and fast with service. Our drinks orders were taken quickly. I ordered a chamomile tea with Honey, my girlfriend ordered water. Another one of my theories is never trust a place with too many items on the menu. When you have too many items on the menu, how do you really master everything? To me it is impossible. The menus were quite confusing so many different items to choose from. I ended up going with the Downtowner sandwich which was your choice of meat on Rye bread with Swiss cheese. I ended up going with Pastrami as my choice of meat. My girlfriend ordered the Corned beef sandwich on rye. For sides we ordered potato salad & coleslaw, we also ordered 'French fries' well done with no salt. The food came out quickly and having tried both the Pastrami & Corned beef I would say 'Ehhhhhhh,' I am not sure I would ever come back. Both my girlfriend and I ended up just eating the meat and leaving the bread behind, the sandwiches were HUGE. Do not get me wrong the sandwiches were good but I believe I could have got the same quality of meat pretty much anywhere. While we were eating our meals on several occasions I had to brush away flies, yes flies that were buzzing the tower (My ears). That goes back to my mother's theory of never trusting a restaurant that is open 24 hours. The French fries were another story, they were incredible. They were cooked to perfection. The fires were 'steak' cut fries and so crispy and still hot to the touch. To me that was the highlight of the meal.At the end of the meal the bill came and I was quite shocked to see that it was almost $40.00, I am sooooo glad we had our 'Groupon' to cash in on which brought the bill down to a more reasonable level. We had our parking ticket validated and we on our way back home. Overall I was glad that finally I got to experience a Delicatessen and that finally after living in Los Angeles for so many years that I got to experience Canter's. On the way out the door my girlfriend and I did take a look at the Baker section of Canter's and the items looked very yummy but we decided to leave without purchasing any dessert. My overall experience can be summed up like this after the meal and buzzing flies away from my face I do not think the words will ever come out of mouth of 'Hey let's go to Canter's.'", "Date": "2013-04-19", "Author_Location": "Hermosa Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Tom W.", "ReviewID": "Uz_ZLnstmgrVr4K6j72NoQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Guys, I am a native Angelino and so I'm totally biased towards anything LA given the amount of crap we take from anywhere outside of LA, let alone the East Coast!!!In this particular instance though, my review of Cantors is going to be anything but favorable.

The complimentary pickles were much more pleasant than eating commercial pickles. And the service was above-average. Now you may be asking, why just 3 stars? Simply put, there isn't anything on the menu that's going to blow you away. Although the menu is very large the bulk of it consists of your typical deli selections, breakfast items, and generic dinner entrees. Just an FYI, I haven't had the chance to go to many delis so I can't really compare how good Canter's pastrami and corned beef are to other places. But solely focusing on Canter's deli meats, I would say that it was really good.Again I can't explain why this place doesn't get that extra star.

If I left the deli right at this moment and called it a night, I still would've given this place 4 stars. It's that cool. But I had one more dish on the way...THE CANTER'S FAIRFAX. It's basically a tower of meat supported by two incredibly fresh slices of rye bread. If you're having a hard time visualizing the sandwich, do this: take an iPhone and stand it up straight... that's about 4.5 inches from top to bottom. The sandwich is right around that size (a little shorter). And just to put it in perspective, close to 90% of the sandwiches' height is meat.

OY!I decided to go for a sandwich, but which one? \u00a0 Since I'm in a authentic New York style deli I'd better try what deli's are known for corned beef, pastrami, right? \u00a0 \u00a0 I choose pastrami on sourdough bread instead of the traditional rye... which I later discovered was a mistake. \u00a0 My friend chose a sandwich with pastrami and chopped liver (eek!) but said it was very good. \u00a0 Our food arrived very, VERY quickly! \u00a0 My sandwich was a large stack of pastrami on plain dry bread. \u00a0 Though I'd swear the bread was of the cheap plain white sandwich variety rather then sourdough, I was dissapointed, but hey that was my choice. \u00a0 Otherwise the pastrami was very, VERY tasty!BEVERAGES: \u00a0My friend asked our server \"Do you still carry Dr Browns?Server: Yes we do.Friend: Do you have the Cel-Ray soda?Server: Yessir.Friend: That's what I'll have. \u00a0Last time I had one was about 20 years ago!Me: Cel-Ray.. what's that?Friend: It's celery flavored soda.Me: Celery flavored...wait...

A nice Jewish deli that has been in the business of quelling deli cravings of the chosen and the goyem, like me, who once in a while must be kosher fed. I am not Jewish, but I grew up near Miami Beach and I know the real deal delis and Canter's is not only real, but because it's open 24 HOURS and it's in L.A. can in addition to serving up good deli food, be certified as surreal.The additional dish at our table - and I can't, if I want to keep my ellay friends, completely decode it for you- may have included personal tidbits, including possibly illegal propositions overheard from, photos shown at our table taken by personal photographers, and amazing deals turned down offered from-Van Halen, Jerry Lee Lewis, David Lee Roth, Neil Young, and Tom Waits. And that was all before my knish even came to the table. We also witnessed what I later learned was the nightly visitation -at his very own booth- of a kinda famous, kinda strange, 1960s DJ dude, Rodney Bingenheimer. At a certain point, the food -solidly good deli fare- and the service- inconsistent, but overall adequate- seemed beside the point, as I listened to all the people at our table who all seemed to be living by their wits, as they manage to at once both fend off and work with the artists they were photographing, designing or otherwise framin to look good, and at the same time do nothing short of skywalkin downdirty bloody battle with those same artist's agents, managers and producers. For the most part, however, they all seemed -as they talked about last minute custom stagelights, nasty personal requests, a spotlit song sung secretly just for them, narrowly avoided stagecenter catastrophes, and managers parading as the poorhouse rep at paytime- well, they all seemed uh happy. Like they were doing what they loved.So when I couldn't find our waiter and I asked another server could he bring me some gravy- for my knish, people!- and he snapped \"I am VERY busy, you'll have to find YOUR waiter.\", I just kinda relaxed back into the surreal swirl of our tabletalk. I figured the real might catch up with me soon enough, and it did. One of the guys at our table used to work at Canter's - ten years ago - he flagged our guy- and my knish was christened with glorious deli gravy.Once the bill was handled- VERY reasonable prices, we headed up to the front. Pastries and pastrami was purchased at the counter by some of the girls in our group and we watched as a couple lookin to be in their 80s sauntered in dressed to fine-deli-dine. The way they were greeted let you know they'd done this gig before. This joint easily holds the sordid and sacred secrets of a few life cycles. We pushed open the door and went out onto the street. Business cards were exchanged. Codes would be honored. sorry but even with all the glory, minus one star for a waiter point blank telling me he's just too busy to even deliver a request.

There's a dedicated parking lot a couple of hundred feet away from the entrance, so you don't really need to park right on Fairfax.Their pastries and other sweets are wonderful; I had a couple of eclairs (I really shouldn't have, but whatev) at the deli before actually sitting down to eat their corned beef and cabbage dish.Visually, CB&C at first glance seems kind of amusing, because here's this pinkish slab of beef, next to half a head of boiled cabbage, but it tastes good, so it works.Prices are low to moderate, so you can conceivably eat here several times a week without seriously damaging your vast portfolio of real estate holdings (*cough* your paycheck to paycheck bank account *cough*) Honestly, buying things from their deli is much more expensive than buying from a large chain grocery store, but there are lots of unique choices available at Canter's to make it worth your while, and worth the cost if you don't break the bank there every single day.The wait staff are attentive enough, and on your way out you can even buy some Canter's souvenirs, like a Tshirt -- sorry, seems like they only have size \"Large\" whenever you ask.

First, my flight from San Francisco was delayed four hours due to a persistent rainstorm. That meant I landed at LAX near midnight starved and grumpy. Ah, Canter's. Open 24 hours. Corned beef for days. I'm so there. It took me about twenty minutes in my Nissan rental to drive up Sepulveda and then Fairfax to get to Canter's. Midnight and the parking lot was packed. So many clubbers and insomniacs filled up this place that it looked like a scene from a 1960's Doris Day movie if she had starred in \"Night of the Living Dead\". Lots of plastic hanging plants. Heavy on the orange naugahyde. Big harvest gold atrium ceiling window. And probably the most densely populated menu I've seen since the Rosetta Stone. Despite my starving state and a veteran waitress who kept buzzing around me all that time, it took me a good ten minutes to figure out what I was going to eat. I needed the $6.25 bowl of Matzoh Ball Soup badly (see photo). It came with those burnt bread chips that melt into debris when you put them in the broth. I liked it, but it sure needed chicken and noodles to make the big matzoh ball fully digestible. I then had the house specialty, the $13.95 Canter's Hot Corned Beef and Cabbage with Boiled Potato. The ingredients were right, but the proportions were off. Just three thin slices of corned beef over a big, moist quarter-wedge of cabbage, and the biggest potato that's ever landed on a dinner plate (see photo). I just wish there was more corned beef to match the gigantic sides. Regardless, it was what I needed after a cold, heartless wait in the Southwest Airlines terminal at SFO. I even hung on to the unfeeling affection expressed by the waitress who kept calling me \"Honey\". It's sure nice to know that LA has a heart and a nice herring fillet for sale.

I was gonna be fairly nice in my review... but things kept happening that outweighed your historical local charm.I have been going here off and on for a few years. I had my first latke's here, I have noshed on sammiches, breakfasts and various other things. The food has never been awesome, but I have always had a good time and left with a full belly. Today, you blew it. My friends and I were seated at 10:40 am (keep note of the time) We chatted, ordered, our food arrived.. we ate.. chatted.. then I remakred that the latke's were just not what they used to be. They were dense and almost tough. Far from the memory of my previous orders. No biggie.. then I cut into my 3rd one.. the cut off bite was kind of attached to the rest of the latke with something stretchy.. yes, stretchy. There is no ingredient in a latke that should be stretchy. ewI showed the odd stretchy thing to our waiter, who was as puzzled as we were.. he was cool and took it off the bill. I noshed on my bacon (meh.. was ok) and we continued to chat a bit.. My friend finished her French toast (which was pretty darned tasty.) We chatted a bit more (we have not gotten together in over a year) then at 11:20, a guy comes over and tells us that they have a 2 hour time limit on being there and we were well over that.Really? Yes, we had been there a while.. and yes, we were planning on tipping the server extra since we were camping a bit... but we were still well under the 2 hours. I pointed out we had not been there and that his assessment of \"well over 2 hours\" was an exaggeration. He said he had to tell everyone that. Now.. had there been a line of people waiting for a table, I would have totally understood that they wanted to boot out the campers and seat the new people. There was no line..no one waiting to be seated at all.. and there were at LEAST three empty booths right around us and I am sure more empty ones in the next room. Ticked. me. off. I was seriously tempted to park my ass there for another 40 minutes to use up our whole allotment of 2 hours.Dense Latke: FAILStretchy thing in latke: FAILBeing cool about that and taking it off the bill: WINJERK asking us to leave: FAIL FAIL FAILI am disappointed in you, Canters....

That's a combo corned beef and pastrami; on rye of course with sides of both cole slaw and potato salad. It's the biggest sandwich I know of on the menu; probably about half a pound of warm smoked, sliced beef. It's one of the best sandwiches in town. The sides were both what I came to expect.

I hadn't even realized there was such a food that I had so little interest in, as I'm generally enthusiastic about all of it. Sushi, indian, peruvian, korean, burgers, dim sum, tacos, shabu- shabu, lebanese, russian....I would've jumped all over myself to show him the best example of any genre of food......except Jewish Delicatessen. My love of bagels with cream cheese and lox is about as Jewish as I get. My dad, however, is from suburban, Jewish New Jersey and has a constant craving for what he calls the \"perfect\" sandwich. Lean corned beef, turkey, coleslaw, and russian dressing on Rye bread. Trying to muster up some enthusiasm, I search Yelp for \u00a0the best Jewish delis. Langer's is the most appealing, plenty of superlatives and accolades from well respected food-porn mags. But then I read out loud the part about how the neighborhood is bit, er, dicey, and he rules it out. Bummer. \"Okay, so there's also Nate and Al's, Canter's...\" \"Canter's! I heard of that one. I think I saw it on Curb Your Enthusiasm! Let's go there, maybe we'll run into Larry David!\"And so, we have dinner at Canter's. I kinda do feel like I'm in New York, but not at a dining destination of my choosing. Dad orders a knish for us to split, somewhat dismayed that we didn't receive a complimentary assortment of pickles. The knish (if you don't know, it's kinda like mashed potatoes in a thin pastry shell) is pretty good, and hot as if it's just come out of the oven. I emulated Dad and dipped it in some \"deli mustard\". As for my meal. Dad just about laughed me out of the car when I told him that the only other time I ate at Canter's I had ordered eggplant parmesan, which I hadn't been too keen on. \"Oh, come on! That's what you get for ordering that in a Jewish Deli!\"Dad instructed me to order a sandwich that came with coleslaw and russian dressing and I could chose between corned beef, pastrami, or brisket. I chose brisket because I do like slow-cooked brisket meat (especially at a southern barbecue joint!). \"Do I have to have it on rye bread?\" I whimper.\"Yes.\" is his emphatic command.So, the sandwich comes and its not disgusting, I can chew and swallow, no problem. \u00a0But its kinda boring. The meat isn't as tasty as brisket I've had, say, at someone's home, this one is more like a dry, bland roast beef than a moist, tender meat. And I really, really, really don't like rye bread.\"What are those seeds?\"\"Carraway.\"\"I don't think I like Carraway.\"Maybe if I had wheat bread. And mayo instead of russian dressing. And some lettuce and tomato, and while we're at it, how about some cheese?I try his \"best sandwich in the world\" creation. It's not my idea of the best sandwich in the world. But the good news is that he is very, very happy with his sandwich. He polishes off the whole thing, carraway seeds and all. I am pleased that he got what we wanted, and then we stop by the bakery to pick up the only thing that really excites me about New York style delis, the black and white cookie.

That you have to drive to. Screw that, baby wants real food.This place is oldskool. When I was there, it'd not been remodeled (though it was well maintained, there is a difference) since maybe 1963, and it was full of old people who seemed like they'd been coming there since then. I used to meet up weekly with friends, from a computer BBS (read: geeeeeks).It's got the usual array of yummy food you'd expect to find in a deli. And the Reuben sandwich . . . ahhhh, there may be a god, 'cos they created this. Giant, juicy, mounds of corned beef and tangy kraut. I think that's the only thing I ever ate there, but I did consume many. I'm not Jewish, as the other reviewer mentioned, I do love Jewish mmmmeat!No @#(*^%(*&^ tofu.

This and Jerry's seem to be in a constant contest for most famous Los Angeles Deli. Canter's has old school charm, it's been around since 1931 and hasn't changed much over the years. The wait staff is friendly and it feels like a family diner and evokes this tremendous sense of nostalgia when you enter. Jerry's has a more diverse menu, is geared a little younger, is cleaner and remodeled, and has really hot waiters. I used to give Jerry's the advantage, because let's be honest, hot waiters make a big difference, but after tonight - advantage Canter's.No, Canter's did not hire really hot waiters but, I tried their tuna melt for the first time. I added tomatoes to mine, I always do. I have three favorite stock sandwiches - the tuna melt, the reuben, and the monte cristo. I still haven't tried Canter's monte cristo and I already knew their reuben trumped Jerry's, but now I can say with certainty their tuna melt does to. I'm not normally a fan of american cheese, but it was ooey gooey poor man's perfection on this tuna melt. \u00a0The tomatoes were cooked just right and the bread crust had just enough crunch. It was also a nice sized sandwich, not too big as to overwhelm, but hearty enough to fully satisfy. Jerry's has been my go-to tuna melt for awhile, but the tides have turned in Canter's favor.So why doesn't Canter's get a five star rating, well the menu prices don't exactly match the decor. After an added charge to throw on tomatoes, my tuna melt was 15+ bucks, pre-tax. I think it's a bit pricy for a sandwich, even one that good, when you market yourself as a family-style diner. Jerry's is priced about the same though and it just seems to be that good old Los Angeles pricing at work. Regardless of this I'll continue coming and will eventually make my way to their monte cristo, but not for a few more years, I need some reason to justify the trip to Jerry's to check out the hot waiters.PS.

In this case, their Chix includes boiled potatoes. Something I've never seen before in a Chicken in the Pot anywhere. Didn't hep the overall quality of the pot. The noodles were OK at best, the bird was fine, but the kreplach....I guess it was kreplach....was weak and reeked of being overcooked. Far cry from what I expect in a kreplach.

For some reason, one of my most vivid memories from that trip was when the tour guide took my family and I to this supposedly famous Jewish deli in Brooklyn. \"Corned beef on rye with mustard and a pickle,\" he said. \"That's the only thing you should order.\" I remember that flavor as being one of the most amazing of my life--foreshadowing my future existence as a Yelper, maybe. For whatever reason, the next Jewish deli I went to was over 10 years later at Canter's. I still remember that flavor. I was pretty excited to come because I'd heard a lot of good things about this place and I was looking forward to recapture that moment on my tongue again.Came here with my Jewish friend from NYC. He got lox and a bagel, I ordered the pastrami and corn beef on rye with coleslaw.It was... okay. Pretty good, and pretty expensive, although I won't necessarily hold the price against Canter's considering this is LA. I was reminded but not convinced. Service here was definitely not so great, with the waitress complaining about giving refills on the coffee and saying she had already given us two when she hadn't given us any. It goes without saying that the ambiance was that of a typical diner. My friend said this place reminded him of New York but was more expensive and not as good.Also, being the nerdy grad student I am, I tried to study here once. \u00a0No outlets or wifi, but my friend and I thought that might help us concentrate. Anyway... I definitely don't recommend it. Our waitress started complaining after we were there for 45 minutes and then the manager came over several times to ask us to leave even though we hadn't finished our food yet, presumably just because we had our computers out. I know this is a diner, but if I'm paying $15+ for a sandwich, I deserve at least an hour of uninterrupted mealtime, especially when there are plenty of empty booths around...One major plus is that this place is open 24/7. Definitely the best option to hit up after hours or after a night out. During the day time though... I'm still looking for my long-lost sandwich.Sorry Canter's...

We decided to go elsewhere instead of wait around, so that's how we ended up at Canter's.As many Yelpers have noted, the menu here is encyclopedic- there's so much to choose from! This time around I ordered \"For Dedicated Fressers Only\" - a large corned beef and pastrami sandwich piled high on rye bread, with a full side order of potato salad and cole slaw. It cost $14.95, but the price was appropriate for the amount of food I got- the sandwich was HUGE!I also ordered a knish- a hefty ball of dough filled with hot potato filling. I remember seeing knishes featured in an episode of South Park (Season 11 - \"The List\") and was curious about what it tasted like. The thing was as large as a child's fist and very filling- I can see how a few of these could be a meal in itself!The service here, especially at 1 am in the morning, is great. Our waiter was a cheerful middle-aged Asian American man who just so happened to have attended UCLA! Throughout the night we engaged in good-natured smack talk, while bemoaning the mediocrity of both USC and UCLA's football and basketball teams.

Wilted, overripe cabbage that must have soaked up the mayo from 5 days ago. \u00a0Had I inspected it at the time, I would have never gotten it. The Bakery really blew it. I steered my way to the Blond mature lady to take my Bakery order as the younger guy next to her was busy picking his nose. Yes, really, he was.I got the Rye Bread, which is always first rate; a Challah, which is always velvety; and some cookies etc. Got home, and noticed the Challah was a brick. Diagnosis: Oven must have been too hot, cause the entire exterior was overdone. Then, the rye bread---WTF? Bland and with no texture. So after tasting the Old Slaw, and seeing these two lackluster breadstuffs, I was just pissed enough to call and tell them about it; and their nose-picking bakery dude. Drove back, returned the crap, and I am reminded what a crap shoot Canters continues to be. No excuse for that cole slaw, period. Bakery blunders---? Oy. CB and CL were great.

The matzo ball soup arrives with a side of bagel chips. I sip the broth and like magic, I am breathing clear once again. I eat a piece of my huge matzo ball and my mouth begins to hum \"Fly Me to the Moon\" by Sinatra. I don't know what goes into making this matzo ball but its seasoned so delicately that the salt comes to you in small refined bursts. After finishing my soup, I am feeling much better and am ready to go back home and take a nap while I have The Godfather plays in the background. And who knows, if I still feel sick later tonight I just might be back for more matzo ball soup.Overall, Canter's is an L.A. institution that serves the best deli food. The corned beef sandwich is scrumptious, the Cobb salad with blue cheese dressing is fantastic, and the breakfast items after a night out in Hollywood is a perfect way to end the night or begin the morning, if you will.", "Date": "2007-07-18", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Phil T.", "ReviewID": "XqOwLRI8Yvq3xrORr10qEw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "2 stars. what a diappointment.

I'm usually the kind of guy that has to try EVERYTHING on the menu atleast once. Of the ten or so times I've gone to Canter's since, I have only ordered the corned beef reuben. Yar, it's that fookin delicious. The corned beef is so piled on I always have to make the corny joke \"would you like some sandwich with your corned beef?\" XD Anyway, I'm not going to go on and on about how the delicate balance of spices and ingredients tantalizes my tongue and feels as if a rainbow is spewing forth from my mouth and eyes - no, all I'm going to say is that if you live close, do yourself a favor and go try it. In fact, don't wait. Do it now. Why aren't you doing it now? Pfft fine, lame asses.Since you're all so intent on finishing my review I'll talk about the service and stuff I guess. Oh but before that - the pickles. If you like pickles this place has amazing ones. They serve you pickles sort of like how other places will serve you bread before a meal. Yar, even the pickles are that amazing. Oh, and they've got their own brand of mustard that's so good I can eat anything with it.. And I mean anything - pears, pineapples, whatever, put that mustard on it, and I'll eat it.Okay, service, this is where I had to take away a point from this place. The waiters aren't quite the brightest crayons in the box. Here's the dialogue from when one of my buddies tried to order a sandwich.\"I want a blah blah blah on sourdough\"\"Oh, sorry we don't have any sourdough here.\"\"Uhhh... yes you do.\"\"No. We don't.\"\"I come here ALL THE TIME, yes you do.\"\"Ohhhh. The sourdough!\"\"Yes, on sourdough.\"\"Well, you know, our dough isn't all that sour... so.\"And no, the waiter guy wasn't kidding. He was dead serious. *cartman face* The one waiter I've had that was good. Is the kramer looking guy when he's having a good day... but if you catch him when he's not having a good day, that guy is scarier than a woman scorned.Anyway to wrap this thing up, from a scale of om to OM NOM NOM NOM (the caps count as a point XD) I give this place an OM NOM NOM NO...

Mmmmmmm.... maybe not. \u00a0But it's open 24 hours a day, and in a city that would like to never sleep like its wicked sister in the east, that's never a bad thing.This place also has seniority as one of the oldest and most respected Jewish establishments in the city, so they'll strive to impress you. \u00a0The waiters and staff are all very nice, and you can't beat the bakery food at the front. \u00a0Freshly made bagels, rugelach, cakes, cookies, and varieties of other Jewish pastries... This place has everything. \u00a0Well, everything but knishes. \u00a0I've forgiven them for that though.The atmosphere is very reminiscent of an old, vintage diner. \u00a0Now when I say that, I'm not talking about the bottles of Coke on shiny counter tops, plush red seats, and \"Mr. Sandman\" playing over the jukebox in the corner type of vintage. \u00a0This place has a different kind of personality, much like old diners that my parents used to take me to in North Philly when I was little. \u00a0Lots of soft earth tones. \u00a0Nothing visually overwhelming. \u00a0It's just a nice place to hang out and grab some grub, especially if you're one of the... how should I phrase this? \u00a0Chosen people. ;-)", "Date": "2012-06-12", "Author_Location": "North Hollywood, CA"}, {"Author": "Maggie S.", "ReviewID": "II_l7zYdMevzk0PFXN3T4g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ah, Canter's. I've been going to this deli for over 10 years and I keep coming back for several things: 1. their pastrami reuben sandwich, 2. their salads, and 3. they're open 24 hours. 1. The reuben comes piled high (though not as high as it used to be) with soft, juicy, flavorful pastrami, Swiss (I think) cheese and loads of sauerkraut, sandwiched between some tasty grilled rye bread. To this day I have never found another reuben sandwich that tops Canter's. It comes with potato chips and if you want fries (trust me, you're gonna want the fries) it's a dollar more. I do love it but my friends and I have it less often these days because they've raised their prices and it's hard to justify spending $16 (incl. tax and tip) on one sandwich.2. Their salads are only slightly less expensive but I give them a thumbs up for their freshness and size. I usually order the chopped salad and by the time I'm through I'm pretty stuffed.3. Although there are quite a few 24-hour places in L.A., Canter's is one of my favorites because they never seem to care how long we stay. Once a friend and I rolled in around 2am and didn't leave til after 6, and they never once said anything to us. Probably because the restaurant was pretty empty, but it's nice to know there's somewhere we can go if we're not ready to go home yet.People complain about the service but honestly, I've never had a bad experience there. Some of the older waitresses are gruff but it's never to the point where it's unpleasant to me. I think they just have a reputation to maintain, so what's the harm?The Kibbitz Room bar next door is divey and the drinks are the cheapest I've ever had. But sometimes if they have a band playing it's hard to hear your mates when you're sitting in the next room over having dinner.

Any other time however, I'm not so sure. Its authentic deli feel and '60s decor are inviting, but things start to fall apart once you sit down. The booths occasionally have ripped vinyl seats, sometimes repaired with duct tape, while the non-booth tables have really uncomfortable, old chairs. Unless you're willing to drop $11-14 on one of their deli sandwiches, everything else on the menu (which is a mess, btw) is your typical diner fare. You'd be just as happy eating at a Denny's.The last time I was here, I didn't want to spend more than $10 on a late-night meal, but still wanted something that would give me that authentic deli taste. So I ordered the Matzo ball soup. It was essentially just a ball of packed bread crumbs in a bowl of some kind of broth. The soup itself had no taste--it might as well have been salt water. The matzo ball tasted just how it looked, stale and dry. Even after it had soaked up most of the broth it still managed to taste dry.

Langer's or Canter's? Pepsi or Coke? Jedi or Sith?I came here with my friend Tim H., my groupon, and two huge appetites that wanted to eat the night away. When we got there, we sat down and spent probably 15 minutes just staring at the menu, not knowing what to get.We finally resort to asking our server what he'd recommend. We ended up splitting a Greek salad, a beef brisket dinner platter, and an Eddie Cantor's Delight [ECD]. Unbeknownst to us, the Roasted Brisket of Beef came with a matzo ball soup along with a soft drink, and DESSERT!The ECD came in three pieces - a towering heap of pastrami, corned beef, ham, and turkey, all piled on a triple decker. Eating 1/3 of it nearly knocked me out, and we still had everything else to eat. I felt that the sandwich was a little on the dry side, as the cheese and the bread stole from any moisture there may have been from the meats.The brisket wasn't amazing, but the fact that it came with a soup, a drink, and a dessert sure made it somewhat worth while. The beef lacked seasoning and taste, as it just tasted like cooked beef. And that's it. The potato cakes were pretty good, but pretty greasy [which is why they were good].The Greek salad didn't seem anything special. Both Tim H and I agreed that we could have gone without it.If you're comparing pastrami alone, Langer's easily wins out, as theirs is more moist and succulent. But the overall value of the meal, service, and presentation of everything, Canter's wins out. The servers were extremely friendly at Canter's, very patient, and knowledgeable about their menu. Our water/drinks were always filled and the servers would come by periodically to check on us, sparking some chitter and chatter to make sure we were good.At the end, the bill was reasonable only because of the Groupon that I had. I'm not quite sure I'd come back on any other occasion, as the food, as good as it was, was not great enough for me to drive all the way out to Canter's for, and not wowing enough for me to spend that much without a Groupon. You're good, but you're not great.So who wins? Canter's for the overall experience.

We opted for the later yesterday which is more often than not, what we get. I am used to the unfriendly staff but today we couldn't get an actual word out of the waiter (an older tall guy with white hair), just a grunt.Our sandwich came out shortly and as never before, there was a strip of grizzly fat down the edge of every sliced piece of briskett on the sandwich. \u00a0I am totally cool with a bit of marbling to enhance flavor but this was a gross 1/8th inch of gelatinous fat on every piece, which could have easily been cut off prior to slicing and piling on the bun.After dismantiling the sandwich and doing our own carving session the waiter finally came back, saw what we were doing and asked if everything was ok... we told him that this was the fattiest thing we have ever gotten here (or anywhere in sandwich form for that matter). \u00a0His shoulders sagged and he did a very exaggerated look away and rolled his eyes at the table next to us and then just shot his arm straight out stating \"Here\".My wife HATES having to give up her meal once it is delivered and with his actions I was already offput... we told him it wasn't necessary, we already had spent the meal up to this point carving the sandwich so we opted not to send it back but we did ask him to tell the manager about the situation just so it could be prevented on future sandwiches. \u00a0He slapped the bill down and we asked him if we could see the manager since there were no further words forth-coming.An older woman named Dawn came over and preceded to tell us we could not have the sandwich free. \u00a0Whoa a second, \u00a0no one asked for a free sandwich but an \"I am sorry that it wasn't up to par\" or even a tiny bit of concern would have been good. \u00a0NO, she preceded to argue over something we did not ask for ten minutes and then said she would go get the owner. \u00a0After nearly ten more minutes we got up and paid and were on our way out when the owner, another older woman, came up carrying our plates with all the cut off fat! \u00a0She said \"That is not a lot of fat! \u00a0I should take a picture.\" \u00a0 I was completely taken aback, first off I don't want to look at that gross gelatin sickness anymore, second I already paid my bill and had enough arguing with Dawn over whether the sandwich was good (by the way, Dawn insisted they do NOT have chefs there, just wokrers and it is not their job to cut the fat off the meats they serve, even in sandwich form!)I told the owner I could not believe she was going to argue with me over the amount of fat and that I did not come to an establishment that I have frequented for 18 years to have the owner start yelling at me! \u00a0I told her I had already paid the bill, to confront me now was just rude and insane. \u00a0I said I hope you are happy because I am leaving upset and wont be back.I did not want a free sandwich! \u00a0I did not even care if they took money off the bill, I just wanted some concern about the one time in 18 years where their consistency slipped and instead they lost a long term customer for life and obviously made me upset enough where I had to sign up to Yelp to let others know. \u00a0Why would you argue and yell at a customer who was bringing a problem to your attention?

Trying to make the best of the situation, I ordered a bowl of matzo ball soup and a potato knish. I'm happy to report that the knish was very good. Made me want to take a trip to New York for some Mrs Stahl's! One of my friend's got some latkes, and enjoyed them. So, at the very least, Canter's knows what to do with potatoes! Unfortunately, the matzo ball soup was a bit... well... pathetic. It was a tasty enough mazto ball, but the broth was bland and there was nothing else in the bowl! No carrots, no onions, no celery, no chicken, no parsnip and no noodles. Nothing! Just broth and ball. BORING! The price would have been right if it had been a substantial bowl of soup, but for that little cup it was far too expensive. Then came the sandwiches. The turkey sandwich was just lettuce and extremely dry turkey. The roast beef was okay, but again, very plain... and the pastrami was just awful.In the end, the food isn't good enough, the prices are too high and the service needs a lot of work. Lucky for Canter's, they also have a bakery. Their chocolate chip danish has been a favorite in my family for years, and I also like their black and white cookie. I'd give the bakery three stars on its own, but only one star to the deli.

I've made and eaten latkas in the past, but this was my first time ever having matzo ball soup, and it was fantastic. It reminds me of having an Asian fish ball, except it's in chicken soup. Not too salty either. I tried one of Danielle's potato pancakes as well, and it was a little too crunchy on the edges and not as soft as I'd like on the inside (perhaps it wasn't thick enough when they cooked it?). The corn beef Canter's Reuben sandwich was pretty good too, but I'm just not a huge fan of sauerkraut. Eileen had the pastrami sandwich which looked good, but I think just judging from the same bread used in the Canter's Reuben, Langer's trumps Canter's. Service Review: The service here was actually really good! Our waiter was very attentive, but not excessively so, and he was very good about making recommendations for us from their extremely extensive menu. Venue Review: The restaurant is located right by a small parking lot that we did not have to pay for (I think because we were there later at night). There is mostly booth seating in the restaurant itself. Upon entering, there is a bakery on the left hand side and the deli on your right. Overall Impression: Their corn beef sandwich and latkas weren't my favorite, but I really liked their matzo ball soup. However, I certainly give them credit for their above average service, especially for such a busy venue.

Maybe it's my own fault, for not ordering a Jewish specialty, lol, but still I was expecting more. Let me start off by saying that I hate pickles!!!! So I was pretty disgusted by the huge plate of pickles placed on the table, haha. Everyone else loves pickles though, just not me. I ordered a club house sandwich with avocado, and figured I couldn't go wrong with that. The sandwich was huge and looked so delicious, but was simply alright, not great, lol. First of all, it was too huge, it was hard to hold and take bites out of not matter what I did! I know seems like a stupid complaint, but still it was annoying. The biggest problem though, was that the turkey in the sandwich was so damn dry, ugh. It was very disappointing, but the avocado was delicious, really made the sandwich that much better.Then we went to the pastry section and I saw all these yummy cupcakes in the window! I fucking love cupcakes, I honestly thought there was no such thing as a bad cupcake, until I ate this one, haha. I should have listened to my friends and just ate cookies and cheesecake. \u00a0Oh and yes its true, LOTS of hipsters and rockers. Well, mostly hipsters, lol. There was an old skool punk band playing in the bar, lol, when we went, so the waitress said we should sit on that side, because we look like \"rockers,\" haha.

It was late at night, just had a few drinks at the dime, so my taste buds were ready for the usual drunk-chies. What could have been better than a large pastrami sandwich with chili cheese fries.. Mmmmm. Sadly, even intoxicated I left feeling up satisfied. After hearing such good things about this place, I think I may have hyped it up in my mind. What I ordered: pastrami Reuben with chili cheese fries. First of all, now that I think about it, the plate of pickles was the best thing ever. Lol. I'm a fan of pickles so just imagine my excitement when the first thing they bring to your table is a whole plate of pickles, so points just for the pickles. Now that they've buttered me up a little with pickles, I'm thinking \"hell ya, this pastrami Reuben and chili cheese fries is going to hit the spot.\" The food took awhile, so i wasn't too happy about that. The pastrami, was not great, and I say that because I've had some pretty freaking bomb pastrami. There was a lot of pastrami grilled together with the sauerkraut in between two thinly sliced rye. I think what threw me off was that it was a little sweet, maybe that was the sauerkraut, but I didn't love it. It was just ordinary, nothing extraordinary. And now the most disappointing part, the chili cheese fries.. I love chili cheese fries. What threw me off was the the fries were like thick cut wedgy fries, I don't like that! Maybe I'm just biased. So points off because of the fry. Next the chili, I really disliked the chili, mainly because there was soooo many big beans In there, I really started to pick them out. And i got them because another guy at a different table said it was the best chili ever... No sir it was not. And on top of that, I think the chili lacked flavor, and it sure as hell was not cheesy enough.Now, when you are paying, the bald guy at guy at the canter. Soooooo rude. All we wanted to do was split the bill accordingly to what we ordered, but honestly he made it seem like the biggest inconvenience to him, and rudely asked what we were tipping so he could factor it into our totals. That guy rubbed me the wrong way. I'm sorry it was such an inconvenience to split the bill into two. Jees.Anyways... All in all, this place doesn't excited me.

As the waiter had told me you cant come to canters and not have the Reuben, so of course i ordered it. By the way the waiter was great even though he wasnt too happy with gia taking forever to order a grilled cheese..After a few minutes of people watching our food came out....steak fries and a reuben mmmmm. I picked up the sandwich bit into it and was taken away for a few moments. Pam ordered the meatloaf which looked pretty good too! Gia's grilled cheese looked like a grilled cheese nothing special haha. The only con i had about Canters is that its a bit pricy..but hey we tried it and thats all that matters. so if you are lokoing for some good eats at any time of the night stop by canters...its pretty yummy!", "Date": "2009-02-04", "Author_Location": "Agua Dulce, CA"}, {"Author": "Kristin M.", "ReviewID": "JhmgNKg-ngxizkIJ_QLclA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My fianc\u00e9 got me hooked on this place and I have to say, best pastrami sandwich EVER!

IT's across the street from Fairfax highschool. It's not the nicest location, but it's still okay..... the good thing about the location is that once you've eaten your mediocre, non-satisfying meal here, there are plenty of more delicious restaurants and cafes nearby like on 3rd street, on beverly, or on melrose....so you don't have to drive tooo far for some better food, but sadly i feel like almost anything would taste good after eating here.FOOD: the food was okay.......kinda boring. okay so i'm a vegetarian so i ordered the vegetable soup which the waiter highly reccommended. It was okay, i mean it tasted alright, but it was wayy toooo salty and it didn't have enough vegetables in it. The best part about the soup was the bagle chips that came with it, and half of the chips were burnt.....very dissapointing. The friend who i came here with ordered the corned beef sandwhich which is supposed to be famous and really good, but he said it was very sub-par. My friend just said the sandwhich was nothing special, and tasted kinda bland for meat that is supposed to have a good strong flavor. Also, everyone raves about the pickles they bring you at canters, but the pickles they brough us tasted wierd. I mean yes they were crunchy, but they also tasted funky......and they weren't salty enough. ATMOSPHERE: there are two rooms to sit in at canters. We sat in the lower level room which was especially dingy, depressing, and dimly lit. I felt like i was in a gross, nasty college dining hall. They other room looked a little b it nicer, it had high-edged, plush looking booths and better looking tables and chairs than the room we were in. The room that we sat in actually kinda made me loose my appetite, I think they really need to take care of the disparity between the atmosphere in the two different rooms.SERVICE: the service was just okay. Our waiter was nice enough, but he was kind of jumpy and hyper. He also treated us like little kids (i'm 19 and my friend was 20); my friend asked for more pickles, and the watier told us to finish our last slice on the plate before he brought us a new plate. I just felt like that was really rude, i mean my friend was going to eat that last slice of pickle anyways, but the fact that our watier ordered us around really bugged me. Also paying here is a little wierd, the waiter brings you the bill, and then you have to get up and go to the cashier to pay for your food. And then if you want to leave a tip, you have to go back to your table and leave it there or find your waiter/waitress and give it to them. This system seemed a little wierd. overall, I think Canter's fame is not really deserved. It's famous because it's like the oldest deli in Los Angeles, and it probably used to be good, but not so much anymore. The food is edible, so i guess if you're super hungry, and every other restaurant within a mile radius is closed, then you could come here (yeah, the fact that it's open 24 hours a day is pretty nice, but it would be nicer if the food was delicious). I honestly wish that Canter's was better, I want to like it, but i honestly just didn't. If you want a good deli, go to Langer's and order the #19, or go to Art's Deli in studio city and order anything and you will be much happier than if you came here.", "Date": "2010-01-08", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Felicity M.", "ReviewID": "-8bfZttg6gQZ7hz1FDUUSw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay... so for $22.22 we received the following:2 eggs with a side of potatoesa deli meal which consisted of:corned beef hashmatzo ball souprye bread and butterbagel crispsgreen beans and carrotsa cup of coffeestrawberry ice cream.Not to mention the waiter was the FRIENDLIEST server I've ever encountered!

I ask for no pickles, not even on the plate. what happens? Pickles on the plate, soaking into my fries and bun, ruining the whole experience for me. I often have to argue with waiters because I dont want them to put those things on my food, and most of the time the menu neglects to mention that they are gonna put it on your sandwich.OK, so that aside. Be sure to specify these types of things. Ive gotten attitude from people there because of my dislike for pickles, which is kind of counter productive when running a business.Food takes a long time to get to you, and the overall experience is pretty slow.

If, however, you are looking for a great, sit-down restaurant that's been in operation for decades, that caters to everyone 24-hours a day, Caners is a must-go. The sit-down restaurant itself offers a variety of foods ranging from traditional Jewish standards, to all-American favorites. Generally, you can't go wrong with whatever you order, but I recommend my two favorites: Matzo-ball soup, the Meatloaf dinner, or a Rueben sandwich. All, of which are delicious.Looking at the prices, you would expect the portions to be small. Not so. Depending on what you order, chances are, you'll need a to-go box to take away a third of what you couldn't finish (highly recommended- the food holds up well for a next-day leftover lunch). Then there's the kosher deli- which holds quite a variety of choices. However, these choices are a bit on the pricy side. So, unless you live in the neighborhood or you have a taste for a certain items such as gelfite fish, you may wish to consider other places.The bakery is a wonder of far too many dessert items, all of which are delicious.

That changed yesterday on the way home from a taping of \"The Late, Late Show with Craig Ferguson\". I managed to convince my picky sister to stop at Canter's for dinner on the way home by telling her of their famous Matzoh Ball Soup I had heard about. She is a big fan of Matzoh Ball Soup and I was a big fan of eating dinner as I was hungry. So we stopped...The staff was great, the decor was awesome - retro Hollywood. It was like stepping back in time. Only without a Delorean - although we did see one of those on the way back home. I ordered a corned beef sandwich on rye with coleslaw, she had a turkey burger and we shared a bowl of their Matzoh Ball Soup. And, of course, a bowl of pickles. You can't go to a deli and not have a bowl of pickles. It's like going to a place of worship and not dropping your pants.Our food came quickly and was quite tasty. While I was expecting a sandwich and some cole slaw on the side, what I got was a sandwich with cole slaw on it. That's not a complaint - I'd eat cole slaw on some ice cream. Hell - I once drank an entire bottle of A-1 at a Denny's on a bet. The bet? 2 burritos from Taco Bell. Obviously, I'm not exactly Albert Sergio Einstein. But, if you take anything away from this ponderous paragraph, it should be that I enjoy cole slaw and condiments.My sandwich was tasty, the pickles were great, as was the Matzoh Ball Soup. I was just in New York a few months ago and had the \"Woody Allen\" sandwich at the famous Carnegie Deli. And, I must admit, that sandwich was better than the one at Canter's.

Really.So being fairly new to LA (and not having actually settled here yet), my boyfriend and his father are always showing me new places I should get acquainted with - the best place to get an oil change, the best place to grab a bowl of pasta, etc... When I asked about pastry, I was immediately steered to Canter's as LA's best Jewish bakery and I've never looked back. Apparently, in the 50s, the boy's father used to come here and get sandwiches and cookies with his friends - and the place is, in his words, \"just as wonderful as it always was.\" I have a peanut and soy allergy, which makes it really hard to eat basically anything I don't prepare myself, and my first question upon walking into the low-key storefront was \"do your products have soy, of any kind?\" The gal checked with the chef with a resounding \"Nope! All of our baked goods are made soy free. All natural.\" That in itself was enough to make me give this place a 5 star review, as many bakeries/delis/whatever often will just say \"no soy\" without even bothering to check with the chef. Now I can't testify to the deli part of Canter's, but the bakery is phenomenal. So far, I've tried every kind of rugelach (yes, that is the real way to spell it), both the plain and cheese-filled croissants and their poppy seed strudel, and they have all been outstanding. The poppy seed strudel, which was basically a sweet poppy seed-filled filo dough roll, is by far the most delicious, amazing melt-in-your-mouth pastry I've ever had in my life! They're kept in the leftmost case on the pastry side of Canter's when you walk in, near the top. Buy some!Prices are totally reasonable for natural, fresh-baked pastry, and the best part?

The place is located on the corner of Oakwood and Fairfax, Canter's owns the validated parking lot on the corner a few yards away from the actual deli. The lot was small and full so we had to look for parking off of Oakwood in the residential area on a side street. The deli is attached to a bar, both are called Canter's, the entrance to the deli is the southern door or the first door you'll encounter when you're walking up from Oakwood.There is a bakery by the entrance, the line begins towards the right from the bakery. The place is showing it's age, the employee's are showing the place's age. I think the only reason this place does so well is because the patrons appear to be enamored with nostalgia. It took almost 30 minutes to get our order in and then it took almost another 30 minutes for our orders to arrive and the people who took our orders kept editing our orders for us so we only go 75% of what we ordered the way we ordered it, we kept having to fix our orders.When I finally got my Philly Cheese Steak, I got a couple kaiser buns with over-cooked cubed steak, triangular onions, and green peppers smothered in cheese. There was more cheese than anything else between those buns. If I wanted a pizza I'd order one. I had a side of onion rings that was so greasy I saw the oil pooling in the fried batter on my plate. My friend had the club sandwich, fries, and pickles. I watched her pick out all the turkey, and other parts of her sandwich. She got a few cups of coffee and a palmier cookie and I could see the cookie was dry from where I was sitting.Here's the kicker, it cost me almost $30 for my mediocre meal. What?! Yes, it was $17 for my sandwich and you have to order all your sides separately.Why?! Why, is it that hard to cook the food the way it's supposed to be cooked? It's an insult to call what I got good food. Foodie's do yourself a favor and stay away.The worst part was the guy who was handling the credit card payments (there are two lines, one for cash on the right, and credit card payments on the left) was overwhelmed when there was more than one person standing in front of him. He couldn't focus and had a melt down when I asked him to add up three things on the check. He freaked and said that we should've asked for a separate check. We didn't know and he was sitting in front of \u00a0a calculator. Really?! Is it that difficult to punch the numbers into the calculator that's sitting right in front of you?

I remember when they first put in that tile ceiling in 1978. \u00a0(Yes, I am not a young person.) You know, the one that has hidden swastikas in the intersecting branches? Don't let this sway you from going though. I'm sure no one meant to have that happen at a Jewish deli. The great thing about reviewing Canter's on Yelp is that no number of positive or negative reviews will stop people from going-It's one of the great non-chain all-night places in Los Angeles. What makes it great? The food? Nah. The food's OK. Pretty good, depending on what you get. The chicken matzo ball soup is pretty trusty, though salty as all get-out. Matzo Brie is great, a dish I force (or nudge) my non-Jewish friends to try here if they've never had Matzo Brie before. My grandma used to call it \"Matzy Brow\" for some reason. It was the only thing she could cook. Really, my grandma was a terrible cook. We were all so relieved when she stopped cooking for Thanksgiving. Unbearable. I should get back to talking about Canter's, because this is not a review of my grandma's cooking- a review I cannot write because A) she is not a business and B) she is dead.How are the prices? Not super-duper expensive, definitely not cheap. Unless you're used to Jerry's Famous Deli. Then it's cheap. If your boss wants to take you to a deli, and you want to rake him over the coals, take him to Jerry's and order a sandwich and soup, and one more item. That guy will be in the poorhouse before you know it.Is the service great at Canter's? Not by a mile. It's actually improved since the 80's and 90's, when most of the staff was aged Jewish women who DID NOT TAKE ANY OF YOUR SHIT. We used to say the secret slogan at Canter's must have been \"The customer is rarely right\". Now that most of those older women are gone, it's younger people working there mostly. I miss those older women. They were like my Grandma- never accommodating, always in a bad mood, but still lovable. By the way, I should mention here that any comments about service are about the service late at night. I've been to Canter's hundreds of times (for reals) after midnight over the last 35 years, because as I say, it's one of the few great late-night eateries in LA. I've been maybe 3 times during daylight hours. There's other places open!I actually worked at Canter's for a summer during college. One of the best jobs ever. I was a host. I was like the mayor of Canter's in the summer of 1990. I was going back to school in the Fall -locally, at UCLA- so I offered to work 20 hours a week, instead of the 50 I was able to work with no school. I think they weren't OK with that. One day, Jackie Canter called me in during the daytime (one of my few times there in the day) and fired me. She said I ordered too many eggs on my lunch breaks. It was a totally weird lie. Here's how much I love Canter's though- I didn't even consider not going there anymore for one second.So why is it great, you may be wondering? It just is. I guess I could say it's the atmosphere. But it's something more than that. Late at night, everyone seems to go there- cool-ass overdressed drunk club idiots, wisecracking goths/ex-theater majors, weird families from countries you can't figure out which, everyone else. I think something that I love about Canter's is that fancy-pants club people who go there after the bars have closed just can't pull off being really snooty here, something I wish I could say about Swingers, which is down the street, and has better food overall. But ridiculously attractive people are more daunting in that space. So it's harder to enjoy the food as much.I don't think I've convinced you properly why Canter's is great. You should just go.

There's no point in going to Canter's to order salad because for one, their salad isn't that great. I suppose their pastrami is great but I've personally never tried it.My usual dishes there besides the matzo ball soup, is the potato knish, the turkey pasta warm, and of course sweet goodies from the delicatessen afterwards.(Begin useless but interesting observation now...)BTW, anyone ever noticed the ceiling decor of Canters?

I'd rather eat at Nate & Al's in Beverly Hills, or brave a trip to Langer's, but Canter's is open 24-7, which is handy at 4am when you're anywhere near the Fairfax district and feel like a corned beef sandwich on rye with dressing and coleslaw.I've only had a fraction of what's on the huge menu; it's sensory overload, but I have a feeling that only a fraction of what's on the menu is really, really good: chicken soup, towering sandwiches, the lox plate, Jewish deli things like that, but when east of La Brea, Canter's is definitely one of my go-to places.Is it Kosher? I don't know. I've seen Orthodox Jews intheir black suits all over these parts, but never inside Canter's.That said, the sandwiches here are big (and on the expensive side). The menu might say \"hot\" corned beef or pastrami, but the meat comes sandwiched to you sort of warmish. It might bother you, if you're that type but there's enough for two or three normal sandwichs in one Canter's Brooklyn Avenue. Also, at times, the crust on the rye can be a little unforgiving to tender mouths, so take some care.The chicken broth is pretty good, I guess. It's better than Campbell's and tastes like the perfect remedy for a cold. I also like the heartier soups, particularly the barley bean soup, and the split pea (if I'm ever there on a Wednesday). The huge bowls come with some bagel chips, some of them sturdy enough to break a crown, but not totally impervious to soup. There are also half sandwich/soup cup combos that are very nice and won't put you under a food coma.There are entrees on the back of the menu that come either ala carte, or as a full meal with bread and butter, a starter like their big bowls of soup, and a simple dessert. I've only had their brisket, but that's because of my weakness for potato pancakes. I've had the corned beef and cabbage. Not bad, but don't be surprised if there's half a head of boiled cabbage underneath that seemingly huge pile of deli sliced corned beef. I've also had their big serving of short ribs, suitable for sharing, which are on the bland side, but tender as ever.Once, a tablemate ordered a salad that looked like it was supposed to feed a family.There's a huge deli case in front and also a bakery section, of which I've never been a huge fan.Toilets for the main dining room are upstairs, making it sort of a trek after a big meal, but it's almost the same effort to walk to the back dining room, adjacent to the noisy lounge area, for the first floor restroom.Their parking lot is nearby, at the Fairfax/Oakwood intersection, and it validates. There's also another smaller lot across that can handle a bit of overflow, but with both lots full, you might have a better chance winning the lottery that finding street parking. FYI, more often than not, a homeless person stationed between the bright restaurant entrance and your parked ride gets you coming and going.The service can be salty, depending on who's assigned to your section, but I wouldn't say it's intolerable; this place, transplanted from Boyle Heights a faint lifetime ago, is an L.A. landmark.

What is there to say about this place? They have fantastic food. Matzoh balls the size of softballs, the best Reuben I've ever had, great latkes and blintzes and even their sandwiches are great. Their deli meat is beautiful, and you can get them lean if you like. (Though why would you??) Excellent pastrami, corned beef, you name it.They have added more items to their menu which has bumped it from being kosher to being all-inclusive, and I pity the fool that goes here for a salad or a burger. They're fine, don't get me wrong, but would why would you go to a deli for something you can get anywhere? Delis are for deli food, and Canter's does that best. The waitstaff is adorable. I love Douglas and his giant hair, and the little man who is always there late, late at night who is always so gracious and fills your water glass every 5 minutes, and the gruff Jewish waitresses that don't smile but actually love you. It can get crazy there around dinner and 2 am, when the clubs get out, but I've never waited for a table in the 24 years that I've gone there.Also one of the few places where you can find Dr. Brown's soda. What a treat, truly. And for the people who want to get their Jewish comfort food fix, they have pickled herring in sour cream, cabbage borscht, kreplach, kishka, and all the goods. And it is damn good. But if you're not in the mood for anything weird, the more recognizable dishes are fantastic.And the baked goods. Who could forget? This review is so scattered because thinking of Canter's makes me pine for the food and the hamentaschen and the cookies and the cakes and the marzipan and the bread and everything is good!

It's so big, this soup does not come in a cup. Everything on the menu is very fresh. The Potato Pancakes come with sour cream and apple sauce (just the way good latkes are served!) and the half order is three of them, I think. If you have had a latke before, you know they are pretty filling. Quite honestly, I can't cover everything on the menu.

Sure, Canter's is famous, but I'm thinking their name is the only thing to get excited about.I came out here with friends back in June after a double feature at The Silent Movie Theatre just down the street. We were starved, it was open, and we figured we couldn't go wrong if they were still in business after all of these years.Boy were we wrong.Most people can find something they like at a deli, and our little group of four had a pretty diverse order. Sadly, it seems Canter's missed big time with two of the group, and of the other two (one of whom was me), the food was just so-so. One friend's whitefish was so bad he had to send it back and order a bagel with lox instead. At least his replacement order was acceptable. Another friend was less than impressed with her eggplant dish. I ordered a grilled cheese (a safe bet) with some sauerkraut on the side. While the grilled cheese was decent (albeit a little cold), the kraut tasted like it was never cooked. I know not all kraut is cooked, but the hot kraut was my aim that evening. Disappointing to say the least. The last order, a simple bagel and schmear, went without complaints, but it's hard to mess that up anywhere.I would have liked to say the pickle spears served to us when we sat down were a high point, but they were luke-warm and floppy (not crisp by any means). It's hard for me to be disappointed by pickle spears, so this was a first.If you're in the area, it's late at night, and you are craving a bagel with cream cheese, Canter's may just be your place.

Ever since my trip to the East Coast, I have become a \"self-proclaimed\" connoisseur of Jew food. In fact, I have considered converting just for the kosherness and the power to scream \"MAZELTOV\" at any given moment's notice. But I can live with screaming it silently in my head for now.Anyways. Every trip we make to LA (which has been quite often lately) we make it a point to stop at one of LA's fine Jew establishments. Today was Canter's. This was my second time here, and although its not my fav in the land of angels, it is the most convenient to where we visit. And it is also very reasonable so we don't mind coming back. Canter's is definitely an establishment. The workers are as old as the building and that's cool. Especially when they can't hear you and you enter a screaming battle just to get your order right. The thing I like best about this place are the pickles. And no I am not some attention-seeking Smurf like Snookie. They just have a damn good Kosher pickle. Not too briny. Not too salty. But there is a bit of spice and a bit of spice is always nice. The corned beef I had on this day was OK. I've had better (cough Langer's cough.) Coleslaw was more like cabbage mayo soup but whatevs. Matzo ball soup was of course a winner. This is what they're known for. Picture a huge mound of doughy goodness plopped right down in a puddle of the most perfect chicken secretions...I mean broth. Of course I ate this first and of course it filled my belly and of course I did not stop there. I mean, corned beef was staring at me in the face, taunting me, telling me to rapture is pink juicy flesh so I divulged. And I'm not sure where this is going...But they did have something on the menu that was UH MAZE ING!! Sweet potato fries. Hella (yes I'm from northern CA) non-Jew-all-the- way-but-any-attempt-to-draw-in-the-trendy-health-\u00adfreaks is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Perfectly crisp on the outside. Ooey gooey on the inside. And not salty at all. And the best part. After our gluttonous smorgasbord of all things Kosher, there were two fries still on the plate. Did I hesitate? Of course not. We don't have a spec of Jew food in my village. So I ate it. And yep. Still crispy and ooey gooey. My only qualm with Canter's is that the sandwiches are dry. The meat is good. But unless you specify or order the extras, all you get is meat and bread. It'd be nice if the thousand island and coleslaw and swiss weren't the cost equivalent of a Nike sweat-shop worker in the end. I mean, if I wanted to pay $12 for meat and bread I would have gotten a freakin' steak and loaf of bread at the grocery store and called it a day. Just sayin'.

Canters is to L.A. restaurants what Magnolia and Collateral are to L.A. films. It is the ultimate old-style Jewish deli, with absolutely perfect cuts of kosher meat, and all the mediterranean trimmings one could want. They've been owned and operated by the Canters family for nearly 80 years. Their baked goods are divine, with eggy bread that makes the heart melt and feel as one with humanity. Their soft rolls and perfect baked-then-boiled bagels will increase your joie de vivre and make you want to do a good deed for the day. As an L.A. resident for the better part of my 28 years, I \"get\" Canters, having grown up with Jewish delis such as Katz's Deli in Manhattan, and I absolutely love my 100% beef hot dogs and knishes. I think people outside of L.A., particularly non-Americans, are always a bit baffled by Canters. When customers first walk in, they are greeted with the gorgeous view of old-fashioned deli and bakery counters filled with beautiful plump meats and baked treats -- Canters displays put The Nutcracker sets to shame. But after that, you enter the restaurant, and this is where it gets sort of strange. The decor is...weird. Imagine an old, beat up coffee shop in NY in the 70s -- think yellowing lino floors, dark pressed wood benches with vinyl tables, and wood paneled walls, and you've got a vision of Canters. The weirdest feature is the ceiling, which is composed of a panorama picture of a blue sky dappled with autumn leaves, through which the lights shine. It's not pretty. It's gaudy. But that's Canters. The food is on the expensive end, with Lox and Bagels starting at $7.50, and full entrees heading up to $12.50. But as the place that Sly Stallone heads after a heavy night out, it's ok for Canters to up the ante on prices. The best thing you could have at Canters is the Matzo Ball Soup, which is a nice combo of unleavened Matzo (cracker) all rolled into gorgeous balls that are slow-cooked in chicken broth. Lovely drunk food, and perfect for if you're under the weather. And they're open all night, so you can enjoy the treats at 4am, post Sunset-strip. The biggest debate in L.A. is not whether Arnie is doing a good job, but whether Canters or Jerry's Deli are the best.

In an effort to keep its original 'flare' it has lost the meaning of 'upkeep'. Not that the place is dirty or anything, it just needs a little love. Some of the servers rush around with this frazzled look upon their faces as if they had just gotten the scare of their life. But for the most part, they are friendly.The menu is massive! If you have problems deciding on what you want to eat (like myself), I suggest looking at the menu before you arrive. After you place your order, the servers come back with your drinks and a little plate of pickles. Yay pickles! Careful though, they are kinda strong, so I wouldn't suggest eating them if you plan to have a make out session later.On to the food!Matzo Ball Soup - I could eat a bucket of this soup. Its very simple and straight forward but it is done very well. The best part are the bagel chips that they give you on the side. Perfect for dipping in the broth. I've been to several of my friend's passover/Hanukkah dinners and I will say that I prefer their Matzo Ball Soup over Canter's but it does come a very close second.Smoked Turkey Sandwich - Turkey was damn tasty, though it comes without any sauce on it. However, Canter's provides you with four kinds of mustard: Yellow, Dijon, Sweet hot, and Hot Russian. Holy crap... that last one will burn your nostrils, be warned!Monte Cristo - First off... this is NOT a monte cristo. Not by a long shot. I would label this as a french toast bread with grease sandwich. The two things that made this a mockery of the beloved artery enemy was the fact that there wasn't a single piece of bacon on this sandwich and it wasn't even battered or fried. They slap a stack of dry meats, turkey and ham (I think), onto two pieces of french toast and serve it with strawberry jam. A sad, sad imitation.Meatloaf with Mashed potatoes - I am not usually a fan of gravy, but when my boyfriend got this dish, I of course tried it. I'm glad I did. It was deeeeeeeelicious. Nice rich gravy on top of some pretty flavorful meatloaf. The mashed potatoes were quite good as well. The plate did come with a side of green beans, but they weren't seasoned... at all. So I would avoid their veggies.Breaded Chicken... thing - Yeah... I don't even remember what it was called. That is how unimpressive this particular dish was. It comes with fries and some sort of green salad (no dressing). Just avoid anything that says 'breaded chicken'.Overall I would say I will visit just for their Matzo Ball soup.

Everything here is definitely done traditionally so there aren't many surprises to be had, but I don't think I'm going out on a limb here when I say that if you're going to a Jewish Deli you are craving exactly the vibe this place puts down.STATS:Value:For my sandwich with coleslaw, and potato salad it was around 11.25, so it's a bit pricey but they give you more than enough, and I do think the quality is worth paying for.Likes:The pastrami (trying the other meats on my next visit) seesaw was tilted all the way up on the flavor side, and completely down on the greasy side. I will just say glorious and you can take it from there.Dislikes:The weird leaf tiled ceiling thing, for some reason it made me feel uneasy, but my complete fat boy devotion to my food when it arrived soon made me forget about my decor woes.In Conclusion:This place in my view is to be experienced, I think whether you're from the East coast Or west coast I'm thinking this might be a spot that you'd want to check out if for no other reason but to rank it in your personal Worlds best Delis list. Also this is a place that I find I will have to come and try again in order to perhaps cement this into a five star, the menu is giant but cohesive.DONE.", "Date": "2011-05-04", "Author_Location": "Tehachapi, CA"}, {"Author": "Nicoline C.", "ReviewID": "dpkxkfM8knpq2HMwyOmh9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Still as good as it was the last time I was there, which was over 20 years ago. \u00a0Great Reuben sandwiches. \u00a0My husband had the pastrami sandwich. \u00a0I love their coleslaw. \u00a0Yummy. \u00a0You have to be a strong person to walk by their bakery counter. \u00a0BE STRONG!Parking is free up to hour and half.", "Date": "2011-06-05", "Author_Location": "Monrovia, CA"}, {"Author": "Kristen J.", "ReviewID": "xeyGYvYrx33nGurPbdSMow", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am definitely a fan. \u00a0I make it a point to come here any time I make a trip into Hollywood. \u00a0Breakfast, lunch, or very late night; this place is FANTASTIC and much more than a simple deli.There is something to satisfy everyone. \u00a0Their menu selection is huge. \u00a0Everything I've had at Canter's has been \u00a0fresh and delicious! \u00a0Don't forget to ask for some fresh pickles to munch on at the table. \u00a0Their Matzo Ball Soup, served with bagel chips, is a classic. \u00a0Their loaded baked potato is a late night favorite as well. \u00a0I've tasted bits and bites of many other things from the menu and have enjoyed all of it. \u00a0Leave room for something sweet from their bakery. \u00a0The stacks of various cookies, cakes, and pastries will get you coming and going.The restaurant itself is simple and straightforward. \u00a0The decor, floor plan, and kitchen setup are all classic-diner. \u00a0I imagine the place did not look too much different when it first opened (maybe it was a little smaller). \u00a0The staff are a little rough around the edges, not too many bright and shining faces around this place, but they are not rude nor do they ignore customers by any means. \u00a0Flagging someone down is usually pretty easy. \u00a0Canter's is a delicious, round-the-clock Hollywood classic. \u00a0I recommend it over Fred 62 or Brite Spot in Echo Park.", "Date": "2011-06-19", "Author_Location": "Glendora, CA"}, {"Author": "Anthony T.", "ReviewID": "cwZRDcsb4IHJWOd647ArOQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Always a great breakfast or late night stop.

They go perfectly with a sandwich.By and large, my favorite food is definitely one of their desserts. The plain Cheesecake.

I hadn't been to Canter's since I was a kid (maybe 7 or 8) and the place still looks the same as I remembered it (the bathroom too) but the neighborhood has changed substantially.We arrived around 2pm on a Sunday to a relatively empty restaurant. The menu is huge and the in-laws (and husband) weren't terribly hungry since they had filled up at the hotel breakfast earlier in the day (I abstained) so they all ordered something small. Since I don't like a lot of standard Jewish fare, I pointed out certain things in the deli case (chopped liver, whitefish salad, gefilte fish, etc) and since the family has already had my matzah ball soup, they weren't interested in the giant softball sized ones offered here(plus it was HOT out).Our waitress was nice but definitely had the deer in the headlights look. \u00a0Soda, iced teas and water were ordered. I also ordered a Dr. Brown's cream soda (served in a bottle) and after that a black cherry one. The MIL had never had nor heard of Dr. Browns. She liked both A LOT. Pickles were put on the table and luckily since neither the husband or MIL like the taste of dill, the FIL and I had the pickles all to ourselves. I liked the half pickles better than the spears but they were both spicy. Since no one except for me was truly hungry, I did order kasha and varnishka's for a starter(something I knew was mellow enough for them to taste). It wasn't huge but enough to share and they all slopped the brown gravy on theirs while I opted to just have it plain. It could have been that Canter's was gearing up for Yom Kippur because this didn't taste as fresh as it should have. Yes, I could make it better and for you non-Jews out there, this dish is just (buckwheat oats and bowtie (or farfalle pasta) mixed together. My husband and FIL had hot dogs and the MIL had 1/2 grilled cheese sandwich and cold borscht. She also had a side of fruit that wasn't ripe and quite disappointing. I had a hot pastrami sandwich and thankfully it wasn't as big as my head (though I was a little bummed that it wasn't because of the way it USED to be...).The rye bread was great-and I took a loaf to go (put it in the freezer in the fridge at the hotel) and the pastrami was delicious.I would come back if/when I am in the area again, but have a feeling there might be another good Jewish deli to be found down in the LA area.", "Date": "2012-09-28", "Author_Location": "San Ramon, CA"}, {"Author": "Mark G.", "ReviewID": "AxC3HX2Nc4TZWn8DcrVI0w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good kosher deli, had matzo ball soup and corned beef and got the great taste I was looking for.

Sometimes a girl just needs to bow down to the power of carbs. Especially on a freezing cold night when comfort food doesn't include a salad. So I dragged my Moobs on over and partook. The atmosphere was well, stogy...in the best sense of the word. Hipsters sitting along side crusty cute old folks and families, and all with giant plates of food before them. Moobs was ill so we got out quick, but the food was good while I shoveled it down and my experience worth the potential belly bulge. I had the half sandwich and cup of soup combo with barley bean soup that was tasty and soooo what I wanted with my toes still half frozen from walking outside, and a brisket sandwich. The meat wasn't too fatty, which is a big plus for me and with the spicy mustard and pickles made my tummy full and happy. Moobs had a chicken caesar salad in a bowl so ginormous it must have been used as a punch bowl in it's past life. Holy crap was it massive.

Having come from South Florida, Home of the Rascal House, it had a lot to prove, but it held up quite well, and every trip since, has been pretty darn good. Let's start out with what makes Canter's unique. The rye bread is amazing. They have the best rye bread I've ever had at any deli anywhere. A golden tasty crust encircling a soft seeded rye is the backbone of all their sandwiches for me. Any time I go there, I get a loaf to take home. I tend to favor their pastrami over their corned beef a bit. Sometimes when it's busy, they get a little lazy and let the pastrami and corned beef sit on the slicer too long between sandwiches. It needs to keep going back in the steamer to keep it warm and juicy. There are usually several pieces of pastrami and corned beef in the steamer, and they should alternate between them, so they are always warm. When it's busy they just keep slicing the same one, and if you aren't the first on that particular pastrami or corned beef, it might not be at it's peak when it gets to your table. I also love Canter's mustard. They use Beaver Brand Deli Mustard, which I have never had until I was at Canter's. It has a slight horseradish taste to it, which makes it unique. Even though they don't make their mustard, I still associate that flavor with Canter's. I'm pretty sure they do have other mustards available. But it's so good with the Pastrami and Corned Beef, you don't need anything else. I wasn't that big of a fan of their Ruben, but I have rectified that. Canter's puts their corned beef on the grill before putting it in the sandwich. This dries out the corned beef a bit, so now I ask them not to grill the corned beef. And it's perfectly steamy and moist in my grilled Ruben. I've never had a problem ordering it this way, they seem very accommodating. Also of note, Canter's has the best potato knish, I've ever had. The mashed potato filling is so full of flavor, and the outside is always perfectly done. You can get them hot or cold, go with hot, but watch out they are pipping hot. Just to prove you are in a real Jewish Deli (as if the neighborhood doesn't give it away) you can get a kasha knish. Kasha is made from buckwheat oats and can either be real lame or very tasty depending on where you order it. Canter's does it right. Next time when you go with a friend order one potato and one kasha knish and split them. I recommend dipping the kasha knish in a little mustard. Now the down side to Canter's and why they lose a star. The desserts are pretty bad for deli standards. I don't know how or why this is. One of the first times I went to the dessert take out side, I \"Won\" a bag full of a dozen hamantaschen (those triangle pastries) and other pastries. I guess they give away a free bag for every Nth customer. Well I'm guessing all the little old Jewish ladies knew it was coming up because there was a loud groan, followed by a bunch of kvetching to management and anyone that would listen. Now these weren't day olds, they told me to pick 12 fresh pastries out from the display. I made a nice diverse selection and held my trophy up for all to see in my large clear plastic bag. Parted the sea of angry onlookers and made to the car. Well I tasted everyone of those dry, not very sweet things, and the only thing it made me think of was the 4 day old \"gifts\" my grandmother used to give me from her pocketbook. The only thing missing was the bits of Kleenex stuck to them. These things were awful. I have tried to warn other friends and family that have gone to Canter's, but we still end up getting something for dessert. And it hasn't been better the 2nd time, or 3rd,4th,...

Sometimes you just have to have matzoh ball soup. Admittedly overpriced, Canter's will be your Jewish mother if you feel a cold coming on. Why is matzoh ball soup univiersally expensive? It's just chicken stock and cracker meal; two of the cheapest ingredients possible. But I digress. They have yummy borscht too. Latkes with sour cream. Now I'm getting hungry.Don't forget to ask for a pickle tray. Oh yummy, crunchy pickles! Your tangy sourness makes my tastebuds sing. There are crunchy bagel chips too.I usually get the pastrami reuben. Veggies take note: veggie reubens are delicious and a nice change of pace. The fries are average; not always hot which is a big no-no.I guess Canter's easily get two stars from me because I can pretend I'm in NYC. You can even extend the fantasy by going across the street to Damiano's, the pizza joint. Not that you'll be hungry but I guess you could have an unusual beer. I digress again. Canter's marries an East Coast vibe with old school Hollywood gumshoe, tragic romance. The bar is tits. You can practically see Bukowski on a bar stool at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday. They pour 'em stiff and the price is right. Wander in on any given random day and you will definitely see some characters. There may only be three, two, or one person but I guarantee your curiosity will be aroused. They book the weirdest bands (you never know what you will get) and it's not really recommended on a Friday or Saturday night (amateur hipsters, crowded, smoky sidewalk). Please order only respectable drinks like whiskey or scotch. The \"Sex and the City\" movie may be hot but Cosmos went out YEARS ago (and they are gross). The fact that you can order a real drink in the restaurant contributes to the stars above as well. It was quite dangerous when I lived around the corner. A great neighborhood. That stretch of Fairfax from approximately Wilshire to Melrose being one of the very few reminding me of NYC (where else? maybe Downtown?).I probably haven't eaten that many different things at Canter's but it doesn't matter. I just love the whole scene. The people watching cannot be beat and you will see an occasional celeb. I once saw Mike Myers outside. I'm the farthest thing from a star-f*cker but I had to holler to him how great he is. He and his wife smiled. Yay.Let's not forget the bakery. Authentic bagels-poppy, onion, everything-and some not-so-authentic bagels-pizza-are winners. You will become lost in a world of cookies, cheesecakes, rugala (recommended!), and marble ryes. A very wide selection of breads baked on the premises are available. A sweet-tooth fiend's (like me!) heaven!Canter's is also a good place to go hang out and have a casual meeting or get some work done. Their large center room is not always open (if not crowded) but they will let you spread out and work there, and, obviously, order something. The service can be inattentive and even verge on the border of being rude or hostile. While I normally cannot tolerate that, this only adds a little more East Coast zing in the mix. I have also had cut-and-dry competency which is my favorite type of service. Get it right, get it quick, no smarmy small talk.

I'm denoting a \"sizeable chunk\" because if there's one thing you can count on at Canter's, it's spending way more than you're anticipating. You want to know how they've survived all these years? It's because a ham sandwich costs $11.95 and looks every bit as much like something you'd find in a cafeteria. This is endemic to most of L.A.'s most famous eateries, however. (See: Pink's). I know full well that I'm not walking out of Canter's without spending less than $35 on a meal for two. I could get a nicer dinner at a better restaurant for that kind of skrilla, but I come to Canter's for one thing and one thing only: the For Dedicated Fressers special w/ potato salad. And pickles. I love the pickles here, even if they do have a weird, can't-quite-figure-it-out, briney taste. The Dedicated Fressers plate is no frills - a mountainous stack of corned beef and pastrami sandwiched between two soft, pillowy slices of rye bread. That's it. No sauces, no condiments - just you and a thick stack of MEAT. They also give you a bowl of cole slaw, but I've never been a fan; it always tastes rancid to me. I have a love/hate relationship with the potato salad. I love the taste, but they don't go German on its ass, so the mixture is typically very wet and mayo-y. I usually pick out the big potato chunks, lest I ingest a mouthful of the goop residing in between. On your way out, be sure to grab a black & white cookie and drop your change off in the black homeless dude's cup in front.

First, we tried to order dinner entrees, but we were told the kitchen stops making them at 11. It was 11:02. Okay, fine no big deal. After going through the menu, which was expensive, huge, and highly unorganized, we ordered. I got the Tuna Salad sandwich, to which my server asked me, \"Just lettuce?\"....and that made me go...\"ummm...i guess\"... Apparently, to get other stuff on it, its extra. I also got it with potatoe salad, which looked like cole slaw and tasted like death. Sandwich was okay, but I've had a much better one at subway.

The waitress' incredulous stare alone, told me I was completely nuts! She issued the standard Canter's waitress \"heavy huff\" as she snatched up my plate. While I waited for my new eggs to appear, I sat there waiting in mortal fear they might be the same, and what would I do if they were! I couldn't bear to face the same hostility again.The eggs returned with the eggs, I waited for her to leave out of sight, and timidly tasted the new ones: WINDEX AGAIN! She shortly returned to ask how the new eggs were, to which I lied and reported that they were \"great\".

The pastrami was...ok. We finished it, but by no means was it the best ever. My pastrami-loving nephew wasnt impressed. He felt it was too dry or salty. The corned beef one was a little better but still uninspired. The montecristo....really? It sounded like a good idea, it definitely was not. When i think montecristo, i think golden-brown, fried, crusted sandwich. This was a normal looking sandwich (with lettuce, tomato?) with slightly browned bread. Not good. We shouldve just got a normal sandwich. I also got an egg-creme to drink. (No, it doesnt contain egg) not the greatest, it had more of a chocolate milk taste, no soda quality. \u00a0For dessert we shared a neopolitan.

I was hoping to find it far inferior to Langer's. Well, I found them to be almost evenly matched. Canter's pastrami is machine-sliced, while Langer's is hand-sliced, the superior cutting technique. However, the flavor was comparable, I felt. I also appreciated the \"old school\" decor, along with Langer's, not having been redone in years.

We were promptly seated (4 of us). When our server came over, she suggested we sit at a bigger table for more room which was considerate so we moved to the big table. Our servers name was Mary, no nonsense, older and fun. She has worked there for 30 years and knows the menu inside out. I took her recommendation and had the reuben with potato salad.

Instead of getting a bowl of soup flavorful broth and little matzo balls, i got a bowl of tasteless broth with one GIANT matzo ball the size of my fist in it :( . oh well.. i made the best of it and chopped it up in little pieces and ate it... it made me miss my friend Joshua's grannys soup. She made KILLER matzo ball soup. In order to cheer myself up, I ended up buying these AMAZING raspberry cookies from the counter on our way out. I got a couple and they rang up to about 4 bucks.... not bad for heavenly cookies! :) I could totally see myself jogging here every morning for one of those cookies. \u00a0Canters.... i might not like your soup but i think i am in love with your pastries. :)", "Date": "2009-07-21", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Irene C.", "ReviewID": "UVZmr7PN_Uw-MEtqtrb1Kg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I totally ordered the wrong things :( \u00a0The matzo ball soup was good, but dry in the middle. \u00a0The chili was so salty I couldn't eat any of it. \u00a0Bleh. \u00a0It had a great late-night atmosphere, but for the prices, I can't really afford experimenting on ordering the right things.", "Date": "2009-10-18", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Ryan K.", "ReviewID": "5-YVEw-H6U136DjoPmoQ4Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "what would i say that has not been said?

My first visit to Canter's took place during an all-nighter campout mission at the nearby Supreme store; a friend and I were going to the extreme to make sure that we both picked up one of Supreme's recently released and highly coveted Kate Moss t-shirts. Nevertheless, we were both starving, and being that Canter's was both the closest restaurant and the nearest 24/7 food spot, the choice was pretty simple. Stepping into Canter's, one overbearing thought popped into my head: my first impressions of the place had me thinking, \"hey, so this is that kind of all-American, temporary-solace-from-the-outside-world kind of feel that Denny's and all those other late night drunchies chain restaurants strive (and fail) to emulate...\". In short, at Canter's, one immediately finds his/herself feeling very much welcome and at ease. The old-school cash register, plethora of deli items and baked goods on display in glass cases, and warmly lit environment all help to create an atmosphere of genuine graciousness - you certainly feel as though you're at home, or you're a welcome guest in the Canter home, at the very least. This sense of warmth continues in the establishment's service (yes, even at 1 in the morning); upon being presented with the rather extensive menu (ranging from sandwiches aplenty to American classics like meatloaf and New York steak), my buddy and I found ourselves pretty impressed with the helpful demeanor of our server, who swiftly brought us a complimentary plate of juicy pickles with a grin on his face. I'm not much of a pickle person, but there was something about the Canter's style of quaint, throwback charm that had me mobbing the plate as soon as it was delivered - delicious, juicy, and that right amount of pickle crunch.The price for a typical meal at Canter's is certainly higher than that of your average diner or cafe; I ordered an open-faced hot roast beef sandwich (which comes with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy). In the interest of appeasing my inner fatass, I also ordered a side of cheesey fries to split with my amigo. He ordered a cold roast beef 'wich on rye, and got a bowl of coleslaw to go along with his entree selection. The dishes we ordered were delivered quickly and without hassle, and to be perfectly honest, I believe that Canter's is justified in its slightly heightened menu prices - in that their portion sizes are pretty damn hefty. A mountain of beef gravy covered mashed potatoes and tender, juicy roast beef was just what I needed to accompany my order of crispy, gooey cheese fries. My carbtastic feast hit the spot, and the freshness of the ingredients really did shine through (especially in comparison to the vast majority of cafe joints that I have tried in my nineteen short years of life). However, my homie's dinner really did upstage mine; I should've known to order authentic deli food when dining at a JEWISH DELI!His roast beef sandwich was served on rye that had the perfect amount of crunch, and the dish was piled high with precisely-shredded meat pieces that perfectly complemented the coleslaw (which was refreshingly a little on the sweeter side). I found myself begging for extra bites and thanked the heavens above when my friend offered the remainder of his meal to me - call me Adam Richman? My buddy and I decided to end our meal with two slices of Canter's acclaimed Carrot Cake, and I shit you not when I say that this dish would be capable of satisfying even Willy Wonka's sweet tooth. Slathered in fresh cream cheese icing and packed with layer upon layer of moist cakey goodness, our desserts were the perfect conclusion to our very memorable meal. My three items (the sandwich, fries, and dessert) totaled in at about $18-20, which is a little steep, but not unbearable. I'd conclude my review here by saying that if you've got the bit of extra cash for Canter's, and you're in the area, it wouldn't hurt to give the place a shot. Canter's provides diners with a little bit of LA history and a well-prepared, most certainly filling meal, all in your own backyard - and at any time of the day/night, at that! \u00a0(Upon finishing our dinner, my brodinski and I waddled our way back to our spots in line at Supreme, where we had a grand ol' time meeting some other fashion enthusiasts - and yes, I did end up getting the Kate Moss shirt, although this was after nearly 14 hours of arduous waiting.

There is one line for cash and one line for credit cards. Of course the line for the cards is always longer. I waited 15 minutes in line to pay for my meal!!! Ridiculous! This is 2011, most people use their debit and credit cards so there is a long line. Only once in a while someone would walk up and pay cash. So the cash cashier was rarely busy while the credit card cashier was like a mad woman. Taking the card, writing the transaction on a log, what is this 1948? Swipe the card and move on! So it's a misuse of the cash cashier, paying for the manpower when they're hardly busy. After I paid I went to the bakery, ordered $15 worth of pastries pulled out my card only to be told I had to go back to the credit card cashier and wait in line to pay for the pastries!! WTH?! Are you freakin kidding me???? There should be a credit card cashier behind the bakery AS WELL as two cashiers for the restaurant, both taking cash and cards, this way the line wont be so long. Needless to say I told them nevermind to the baked goods and walked out. Whats with the strict rule of only having one credit card cashier? A 100% TOTAL inconvenience.

It feels like eating food from people who're from the \"Old World\". They have a way of preparing and putting ingredients together that just makes them taste like an Old World experience. I'm sure a bbq beef burger prepared by an old cowboy who's lived out in the desert most of his life from the 19th century, is different from one you would get at Carl's Jr. or Barn Burner in Pasadena, CA. It just has a care and sensibility passed down from generations put into it, and it's not the typical eatery that's after the hype of taste (all these weird new distinctive tastes with no history to it) and faked nostalgia. This is the real deal, prepared old school. Very old school. All the people who appreciate history, and can seperate a McDonald's soft yogurt from one that's been churned over a brick oven in a massive iron kettle will agree. I always have friends who want to make a stop here and get something from the bakery for someone out of town or bring them here if they're from out of town. Definitely one of those must do things for people who don't live here.

A bakerey with pastries galore is already a plus.. though let me continue.The nice server guided us to a large area of the resteraunt where we were sitted in a boothe known to be a favorite of Guns N Roses (there we go again!) where they were photographed some 25 years prior.Friendly service, cool decor and a menu with enough variety to please even the most bi-polared eater out there.. hmm so far Canters = RAD!Because of a strict diet I stayed away from a heavy meal and opted for a Greek Salad instead with a side of Fries.

Want your places cool, trendy and sleek? You won't like it.The only changes I've seen to canters in many years is the removal of the pay phones at the tables. The last big decor change was in the 70's.It's a little dark, you will have to wait for a table often and the coffee IS pretty awfull. So don't get coffee, get an egg cream. Get a huge pastrami or corned beef on rye (be sure to get a side of the house dressing) get a big bowl of the beef and barly soup, and DON'T hit the bakery until you've eaten.Awesome pickles, my daughters favorite, great sandwiches, awesome potatoe salad and the bakery is a sugar junkies wet dream.Remeber also ther are different crowds here. Daytime you can relax, bring the kids. A lot of older local folk, a much quieter crowd. Night can be loud and full of the after club crowd so be prepared to wait and shout sometimes.BTW, this has become our place on Xmass day. After presents. a little nosh at Canters and then a movie or something.

But when time rolled around for mine, I'd request, \"Please, no Canter's.\" \u00a0Even if one is an aficionado of deli food (I'm not), better can be had (Jerry's in Studio City). And parking here (or lack thereof) is almost comedic. The food is nursing-home bland and overpriced -- and some of it (like the onion rings I once sampled from a coworker's plate) is so greasy that it borders on inedible. I've have better onion rings at fast-food places in Middle America. The matzo ball soup is a salty, watery concoction with a diminutive, gloppy ball or two bobbing around and a hint of vegetable. And then there is the tortellini: Kraft mac 'n' cheese has more flavor (and less of a glue-like consistency). So even though I'm not much of a sandwich person, I learned after a few coworker outings to stick to the sandwich menu. Pity that whole grain bread usually isn't an option here.I'll admit that having been enticed by the bakery/dessert cases near the checkout area: some very yummy-looking pastry. I did buy a chocolate-chip cookie once, and it was rich and delicious. But then after the next Canter's luncheon I noticed two flies buzzing about inside a case above a row of coffee cake and strudel-like pastry, and I quickly lost interest in buying any more sugary wares.If my old employer had remained in the Miracle Mile location, some of my former coworkers would still be frequenting Canter's almost religiously. It definitely has a certain come-as-you-are ambience that has become rare in the La Brea/Fairfax corridor. And then there is the faded glamour of dining in a place that has seen its share of celebs (though you'd hardly know from the absence of any defining decor).", "Date": "2012-01-07", "Author_Location": "Palm Springs, CA"}, {"Author": "J M.", "ReviewID": "7_CvTIfxbHwetNH5X1yefQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Yes good food but they make little effort to \u00a0make it or the restaurant anything special.

And I happened to be in the area during a weeknight so I tried it out. Small parking lot at the corner with an attendant. It wasn't full and there was an hour and half free parking with validation from the restaurant. Walked in and there's a bakery up front - more on that later. The place is old with the brown pleather seats and the linoleum tables - vintage old, not dirty old. But I feel like they could use an upgrade. The prettiest thing in the place is the stained glass they have for the ceiling and the part of the partitions. The design is red, gold, orange leaves like for fall. Anyways, we were seated quickly and a busboy immediately brought us silverware and the waitress brought out water. I had perused the menu earlier online so we were ready to order right then and there, within a minute of sitting down. We got the matzo ball soup and the Canter's Fairfax to share. The food came out pretty fast. In a minute, the soup arrived at our table. Just a bowl of chicken broth and a giant matzo ball - the size of a baseball. If matzo meal is supposed to be just matzo crackers, it tastes better darn good. Some of that chicken broth flavor is integrated into the ball. Our sandwich came out about 5 minutes later. It was so thick with corned beef and pastrami, I could barely fit it into my mouth. It was also very messy to eat. But in a good way - it wasn't too saucy or wet, pieces of meat fell out of the sandwich. I know they set the standard for pastrami here, but I have to say I preferred the corned beef over the pastrami. There seemed to be more corned beef and it wasn't overly salty. The pastrami had a sort of pepper rub on the outer edges of the meat that turned me off a bit. \u00a0Gotto have it with those delicious pickles too. Only 3 came on our plate so I'm not sure if you just ask to get more or not. \u00a0But overall, half the soup and half a sandwich were delicious and completely filling. Wasn't completely shocked by the prices this time as I frequented a deli in NYC a couple months before. But wow, Subway prices it is not.

I must say I was very disappointed! Our dining experience was just the opposite! Our server was Fran. She was rude, disrespectful, impolite, and obviously did not belong in this business. Her attitude was so bad we couldn't believe it!!! \u00a0She basically told me I couldn't have fries with my sandwich. I would ask her a question about the menu and she would answer with disgust and in a disgruntled manner if she answered at all. It took everything I had to stay put long enough to eat my lunch. If you get Fran as your waitress, PLEASE ask for another.

It is not a good smell or a terrible smell, it is a signature odor. Once sniffed it will be indelibly associated in your brain with the place. \u00a0I would say its main components are dill pickle brine, chicken soup broth, and the bleach they use when the floor is washed . You will also likely taste Javex if you order hot tea. Relax, it's always been this way. If you don't like drinking Javex, don't order tea. You can't taste it in the coffee. I wonder why?Second is the canterankerous (my word Canters + cantankerous) \u00a0waiting staff. Some of them have served Janis Joplin. One second they are endearingly calling you honey and the next they are being sarcastic with you bordering on rude. If you're lucky you'll get a grizzled really old waitress who might have served Janis and who knows exactly how to give you the business. This is part of the signature charm that goes with the signature odor of the establishment. For more fun try asking your waiter or waitress to take back the tea and bring you some without the Javex taste. Third is the psychotic florescent back-lit ceiling shining above your head in the main dining area. I can't explain it, you would have to see it but it is somehow nauseating. Just don't stare at it. Of course if you are an abuser of certain illegal substances, this can be difficult. Since it was installed about twenty years ago, stoned-out clubbers have preferred to sit in the adjoining dining room. Fourth is related to third since Canters is one of this cities few twenty-four / seven restaurants. For the juice of the juice go there on a Friday at two in the morning. Fifth is their bar, The Kibitz Room. \u00a0You can see really bad bands, and occasionally really good ones. You can also hear jazz for the price of a drink and that is becoming rare in this city. Sixth is the take-out bakery. Depends what you are talking about. Compared to a supermarket bakery it shines. Compared to a specialty bakeries where trained chefs 'create' \u00a0from the best ingredients, butter for example as opposed to shortening or margarine, fresh apples as opposed to the canned kind, then the fare at Canters suffers. Yes, I know that the cakes and cookies are dense as lead because it is once-removed from the pastry Jewish babas baked half a century ago. Even if the person who throws the slab of shortening into the stainless steel industrial mixing-bowl has Spanish as his first language, I'd give Canters a pass on density and weight for that reason. But a real apple strudel is labor intensive and built from layers upon layers of paper-thin filo-dough between which are fresh apples, nuts, and raisins. The more flaky layers, the more status for the baba. This is the desert Baba would given you as a prize for eating all the over-cooked mushy vegetables on your plate. Still if you need your strudle at four in he morning where else is there? Now about the sit-down food: Always a bride's maid never a bride. Canters is not La's best once-Kosher deli in any category but often they rate in the top two or three. (Well maybe the best baked apple in town can be had at Canters but there is not a whole lot of competition.) What deli people care about they do well at on average at Canters. The corn beef or pastrami on rye is quite good. The Matza ball soup is above average but, again, only a contender when compared to a few other similar joints. The soups generally are better at Juniors in the West End, which is in an entirely different world. The crusty rye bread at Langers, however, beats them all out by a huge margin and the pastrami and corn beef between those magnificent slices of the rye bread edges them all out as well. The problem is, if you want to eat a sandwich after 4:00 PM you can strike Langers off your list. Langers has truncated business hours due to the fact that the Pico-Union location where they've been serving those sandwiches since the age of the dinosaurs is now perceived to be dicy going after the sun sets. Canters, however, with its well lit free parking is situated in the more up-scale but still not sterile Fairfax district. \u00a0This location, just a little off the beaten tracks of The Strip or downtown Hollywood, contributes to the fact that Canters remains one of LA's venerable late-night institutions. Those semi-naked pierced tattooed cuties are no where near as tough as their boyfriends look.What I'm saying is, although other delis compete on food, as far as the LA zeisgeit goes, Canters stands alone. Langers, for example, is more a museum of delis as they once were and worth the visit for the food alone, whilst Canters remains a scenester hot spot with the quite unusual distinction that, unlike say Denny's, \u00a0the food is actually reasonably good. \u00a0The price is, of course, reasonably high but that is to be expected, no?", "Date": "2009-01-09", "Author_Location": "Culver City, CA"}, {"Author": "Skydog C.", "ReviewID": "Ekq0c1iEXAi6YeqZnEnj0A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this place ..its historic, seems like 1950's.
