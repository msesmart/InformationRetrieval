We had a reservation but had to wait maybe 10-15 minutes to be seated. We got a drink at the bar while waiting which was loud and crowded but fine. I started with a smokey pablo (marg w mango, chile, and blueberry). Yum!! After we were seated, our waiter immediately greeted us! He continued to be friendly and attentive throughout the meal. We started out with the guac trio (traditional, toreado, mango). The mango was my favorite, but all were good. We then shared two taco platters - estilo baja (mahi mahi, Mexican slaw, and chipolte aoili) and camaron (shrimp, garlic, and avocado) - and plantanas machos (fried plantains and ginger-jalapeno sauce). Both tacos were amazing as were the plantains. I had a second margarita - this time the Pera Te, which had black tea-infused tequila, more tequila, pear, lime, and agave nectar. Really good but not as good as the first one.It was one of our friend's birthdays so we shared a tiny caramel flan. The flavor and consistency was incredible! I usually don't like the texture of flan, but this one was so delicious! Definitely a really tasty and fun restaurant.", "Date": "2014-06-25", "Author_Location": "Saint Louis, MO"}, {"Author": "Justin B.", "ReviewID": "RAIK7d9k2w5-Ff_SmKJ9DA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that when we were being seated for our RESERVATION the host had the nerve to ask us to finish in an hour because they had another reservation coming. \u00a0I've never in my life had someone tell us we had a limited time to eat at a restaurant when we had a RESERVATION. \u00a0Guess what? \u00a0It's YOUR job to figure out your reservations and capacity, not mine. \u00a0Don't accept our reservation if you need us to eat on your schedule. \u00a0So that was not a good start.This was a shame because the food was actually good. \u00a0That's about the only good thing I can say about this place, however, and the only reason I gave Mercadito two stars vs. one.The music in the restaurant was so loud one might think they were conducting an experiment to see how loud a place can get and still have people sit and eat. \u00a0The weather was muggy and humid outside and somehow it managed to be even muggier and more humid inside. \u00a0I'm fairly certain air conditioning has been invented, so I'm confused as to why the restaurant would refuse to use it when it's 85 and gross outside.Really they need to transplant the chef to a place where the food is highlighted, because the rest of this place is what I imagine people who watch Entourage feel like a restaurant should be like... loud, chaotic, humid and \"hip\". \u00a0If you're in your 20's and an insufferable person, I think you'll probably find this place more tolerable than I did, since it seems to cater to that kind of low-standard crowd.All-in-all if they actually kept the restaurant under 80-degrees and the music under 5,000 decibels I could consider dining here again due to the food being solid, but considering we were asked to not take more than an hour to dine when we had a reservation... that sealed my decision not to ever come back to this place before the noise and temperature even factored in.", "Date": "2014-06-29", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Kate W.", "ReviewID": "zl3zMYR_xEqiYkB6zlwoHw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went back for dinner when we couldn't get a reservation for a larger group (6 people) on a Saturday night.Pros: \u00a0- their margarita is AWESOME. \u00a0real good. \u00a0recommended. - the pork cheek taco we had was outstandingCons:- it is loud as eff in there! \u00a02 bachelorette parties in the place and your conversation is out the window. \u00a0bummer.- they seated 6 of us at a booth placed precariously on a raised platform. \u00a0we had plenty of room but my fiance and i (not in the booth) couldn't get close enough to the table because of the platform. \u00a0WEIRD.don't go if you want to have a cozy conversation (unless you can make it so you only sit next to the people you like and the weirdos are far enough away that you don't need to talk to them--pro tip.)", "Date": "2014-06-23", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Grasan K.", "ReviewID": "h58VedBxPIrFhMoB6MktAg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I frequent this place as much as possible! \u00a0The drinks here are creative, crafted, delicious, and sometimes on fire (literally). \u00a0Great spot for a group as their dishes are perfect for sharing. \u00a0Their assortment of guacamole, fish tacos, queso fundido with chorizo are some of my absolute favorites. \u00a0Service is always great, and did i mention industry folk get 50%!! \u00a0Can't beat that with a stick! \u00a0Love this place!", "Date": "2014-07-16", "Author_Location": "Harlem, Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Rich B.", "ReviewID": "B-BpUn2oF2lF6fIsMnn_Fg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went here to eat while on a work trip to Chicago. \u00a0This place is in a great location and easy to find. \u00a0We had reservations and only had to wait a few minutes. \u00a0Pretty impressive considering it was jammed pack. \u00a0Some co-workers set up the reservation so I wasn't sure what to expect as tacos are their main dish there. \u00a0We ordered pretty much every kind and they were all delicious. \u00a0My favorite was the Mahi taco. \u00a0I devoured several of those for sure.One thing I heard was a must have while there is the margaritas. \u00a0We ordered a few pitchers and it didn't disappoint or fail to get us liquored up fairly quick.I originally started this review back in March when I first went and have been back twice already since then, basically stopping in everytime I go to Chicago.If you're in that area, I highly recommend giving it a try. \u00a0I'm very picky so any place I go back to, I feel is really good. =)Don't forget the margaritas!", "Date": "2014-07-10", "Author_Location": "Fairfax, VA"}, {"Author": "Dan S.", "ReviewID": "5zmgYYUgIbEXZ7XZPNnBsA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So you find yourself in Chicago's River North Neighborhood and you feel like some damn good tacos and some quality Mexican-ish drinks. Your first choice of course is Frontera Grill, but it's a two hour wait. And you may ask yourself should I just catch a cab down to 18th street to get the good stuff. But you're in a slacker mood because you really don't feel like making the trek to neighborhoods beyond the River North bubble, you look at your options. A few blocks is your plan b. Enter Mercadito...the good news is even on a Friday you just maybe able to get a table and when you walk in - the place is vibey, dark. The outdoor seating is def worth it weather permitting...so what about menu. The small Cerviche plates - ok, average. The Guac - it's ok. The salsa - not ok, it's a weird looking puree thing that tasted like diluted hot sauce. Fine. missed with the salsa - the tacos? They are decent - the steak is flavorful, the fish is crispy but..that taco plate is pricey. Look, I get it - you're in River North, rent is expensive but can't we get a nice presentation going? They bring you (4) small tacos that have too much food on them...it's just a little off kilter. How about a separate plate of fish, steak, etc and then bring me some condiments and a stack of tortillas? Make me feel good about spending $20 for this!Ok, I maybe overly critical as Frontera sets the bar rather high and frankly, I don't mind dropping the cash if you can deliver a similar experience.So yes - in many US cities Mercadito is a yelp 3 star place but alas with so many innovative places opening up in Chi-town, they are due for a tune up. If they do, i will come back and spend more money.", "Date": "2014-06-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Steph S.", "ReviewID": "oPUKN8dB9GSOs12sutWNOQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I hosted a private party here for 20 people on a Sunday night.

This isn't your sit-and-chat-for-2-hours kind of place. The energy is high, it can be pretty noisy during peak busy times, and the meal pace is pretty quick. Yes, they want to turn tables--it's a business and I'm sure their success would be diminished if they catered more to the lingerers. I've dined at Mercadito about 5 times over the past 3 years, and I've never been disappointed in the service or the food. The atmosphere is fine, because I know it's busy and loud and I'm willing to deal with that so I can eat their fabulous morsels. :) Favorites: pastor tacos (spicy pork with pineapple), skirt steak, mahi tacos and any of the salsas with chips. I haven't personally tried their alcoholic drinks, but I understand they had a mixologist create many signature drinks specifically for the restaurant. From what I have heard, they are quite good, although pricey.So as long as you're not expecting a quiet, drawn-out or particularly cheap meal, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy the flavors Mercadito offers. NOTE: Mercadito also offers cooking demos once a month for about $55/person and it includes food and drink pairings.Check their website for dates. I will be attending next month's. :)", "Date": "2014-07-09", "Author_Location": "Downers Grove, IL"}, {"Author": "Srishti K.", "ReviewID": "sei_aQDz9PHN7N0HxOp36g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a trendy place and delicious food/drinks, this is a great choice. I have been here twice - once for lunch and once for drinks and I can't wait till I have a chance to go back. FOODFor the appetizer, we got the guacamole trio. Usually, I am perfectly happy with regular guacamole but their mango and pina styles are AMAZING. If you like a spicier guac, I would go with the pina. The mango is my favorite because it's sweet and spicy all at the same time. The only reason this place is a 4 and not a 5 (other than their prices) is for the tacos. For about $16, you get 3 tacos which admittedly is pretty filling. I got the chicken tacos. The meat was great, and I like that they have pieces of sweet potato. Other than that though, the tacos are definitely a little bit on the bland side. They also overstuff the tacos, which makes for some super messy eating. The tacos are good, but probably not worth the price. DRINKSMy absolute favorite thing about Mercadito is their pineapple margarita. If you like spicy food, get the red chili powder on the rim. It adds an extra kick that is way better than just salt. The margaritas somehow manage to be delicious and super strong at the same time - perfect for happy hour!AMBIENCE & SERVICEThis place looks super cute. A lot of reviews have commented that this place is super loud. I think it gets louder around dinner, but it is pretty reasonable during lunchtime. I went in at about 12 and didn't even need a reservation. I didn't make much note of the service but that's probably a good thing -- it's perfectly adequate.", "Date": "2014-06-21", "Author_Location": "Torrance, Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Ruma T.", "ReviewID": "r-LCq9Byw0uQKxiq4bePbQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok.

On a recent trip to Chi town my girls and I decided on this place since it was in our hood. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was Dayyyyyum it's loud in here! Did they want it to be loud and trendy on purpose? Not sure. But we could barely carry a conversation right next to each other. We were seated at a booth right next to the restroom which only served one patron, so we often had a line of people over top of us. The food is served is 4's, which I assume is family style? By I have no idea why. You are not allowed to mix and match so we found ourselves ordering 3 different orders steak, mahi, and al pastor and just adding a taco to make it 5 family style and we each got three. The steak was surprisingly my favorite. I loved the chargrill flavor on it. The mashed potatoes on top were also a strange but interesting touch. The Al Pastor has a great spice to it, and the pineapple was a great contrast to the heavy flavor. I wasn't a fan of the mahi. It was a bit too soggy from all of the slaw. We also ordered up a ton of their margs, all varied in flavor. I really loved the Hibiscus and red pepper one. It was super spicy, but fruity all at the same time! I also tried the mago and it was extremely fresh. I ordered the regular margarita and it was nothing special. I didn't particularly love the grand marnier in it. Overall our meal was very flavorful but I need to add that all of the food came out within 10-15 minutes some even before we got our drinks and our total dinner time was seriously close to 30 minutes. We felt like they were rushing us out, and we did not really appreciate that especially because of the amount of money we were dropping. $22 for 4 tacos? $14 for the margs? Still don't understand it. You can get delicious tacos pretty much anywhere in Chicago. And don't come here if you are looking to catch up, or have a dinner conversation. Come, sit at the bar, order a marg and enjoy the atmosphere.

So my friend, who has been here twice, and was raving about the tacos here, heard through a coworker that they were offering a cinco de mayo special where the menu would be 50%. Sounds too good to be true? Well guess what, it was.Reservations were originally made for May 5th, but was changed to May 4th, bc my friend called to confirm May 5th reservations and was told that the special was actually tonight and not the evening of May 5th. Once arriving, we were promptly seated and served water. My friend once asks about this 50% off special, and waiter is confused as to what this was. He explains there is no such thing. He rambles on and mentions that the deal was only for ppl in the industry. Then he offers to discuss with manager. After disappearing for like 10 minutes, he comes back, and says the same thing, that there is no such special, that it doesn't exist. This whole ordeal goes on for like 30 minutes when finally some \"manager\" comes and talks to us. He and the waiter disappears for like another 5 minutes, and the waiter comes back and says he'll offer only a 50% discount off guacamole and some other apps. Regardless, it was late, and we were hungry. So we went ahead and ordered the trio of guac, trio of ceviche, and two orders of lobster and fish tacos. No alcohol, bc we were not in any mood for it. Just wanted to satisfy our hunger and leave. The food definitely did not live up to the hype my friend had hyped it up to be. She raved about the lobster tacos, which in my opinion was mediocre at best. Lacked flavor, and my taco had only a small sliver of lobster meat (which was gone in one bite). Fish tacos was flavorful, but definitely inconsistent, bc my sister got a burnt fish in her taco. My friend was also definitely disappointed this time around. Ceviche: meh. They tried to be fancy with it by using passion fruit juice in place of lime (I assume bc there was absolutely no lime flavor like in traditional ceviche). Seafood definitely lacked flavor. All I could taste was passion fruit. Guac trio: just okay. I can make guac that tastes more flavorful than what we were served.Service itself was completely horrible! No apology for the miscommunication about this supposed 50% off special. Why would my friend make this up when she made the reservations and even called to double check. Regardless, if this special didn't exist, there should have been, at the very least, an apology for any miscommunication. I definitely feel that the attitude of the waiter changed for the worse bc we didn't order any alcohol. I also felt that we were discriminated against bc we weren't dressed up like we were out on a night in town (social status), like the majority of the other patrons were. They probably felt we weren't going to give a great tip, so they decided they weren't going to treat us like great customers. (Mind you, I always give at least an 15-18% tip, even for average service. But having this kind of service, coupled with mediocre, expensive, small portioned, trying to be fancy with Mexican food...what kind of tip do you think they deserve?)I will not be returning to this restaurant. There are many better restaurants out there that offer much more tasty Mexican food for a much more reasonable price.

When I have to wait for close to 45 minutes to sit down is when I begin to be somewhat less understanding. And I don't even think we got the worst of it! The remarkably small \"waiting area\" appeared to get fuller and fuller as we ate our meal. Onto the food. My roommates and I ordered three guacamole to start. My favorite was definitely the Tocino (with bacon!). For the main course we ordered four different tacos to share.

First of all, let me clarify by saying that the food here is easily 3 to 4 stars. And the drinks?? Oh, the drinks!! Also, easily 4 stars. \u00a0 But apparently, Mercadito is great for takeout and horrible for dine-in. What demotes Mercadito to a 2-star Yelp rating is the service. I've been quite a few times, but my last visit was-tautologically, my last. I'll save you my life story and keep this short: went on a Friday evening with a friend. The second we walked in, we could already tell by the way we were being treated that they were busy and wanted us out ASAP so as to accommodate other people. We were hurriedly and brashly sat in a very jam-packed section-the conversations of the tables on either side of us were way too audible, no matter how softly they spoke. We were constantly being circled like sharks do fish, by servers and busboys alike. Pour quoi, Mercadito? Moving on, we were so put off by the service that we decided to engage in some good ol' culinarus-interruptus and GTF outta there. We asked for our check and they were only too happy to oblige. Before we could say anything else, a BUSBOY with a dirty table rag and everything- not even a SERVER- carted out food away from our table at the speed of light and ran into the kitchen. In his haste, he left half of our other food items on the table e.g. tortillas, my green rice, etc. I told the server \"please take these to him and make sure he puts this with the rest of the food\". Fast forward to us getting home and what beautiful surprise do we find waiting for us in our go-bags? The answer is 'NOT our leftovers!' Apparently, they had left out half of our leftovers. I was so angry, I couldn't speak. We barely touched our food so we had basically just thrown away a bunch of money. This is sad on so many levels because I used to be Mercadito's #1 unofficial PR person because I used to, and still think, their food is amazing. But after that stunt, phooey on them.

The bib lettuce was not large enough/strong enough to hold all the filling, so it was pretty messy, though tasted fine. As far as drinks, ordered the traditional margarita and then the big nose goes to mexico, which came on fire when it arrived at the table, so that was cool.Also--and I'm guessing they do this to condense servers' seating zones/areas?--we were seated at a table right next to another couple (noticed the same thing w/ other parties that were seated after us), and you could barely get in and out without bumping the other table, and I always feel like people overhear conversations.

Mercadito isn't your typical Mexican restaurant. This place is moreso on the swanky side, and the prices definitely reflect that. Mercadito also has a full bar which is stacked with tequila for days. Go with their margarita or any other tequila based cocktail and you won't be disappointed.

Each had it's own distinct flavor and tasted incredibly fresh. The only downside was that each was an incredibly small portion, and when split among 6 people, didn't give too much for each person. At $14.50 for 4 normal sized tacos, these bad boys were pretty pricey, but to give Mercadito some credit, they were also pretty amazing. The al pastor didn't taste overly oily and was incredibly juicy. Same deal with the carne asada tacos. My polo a la brasas ran $17.25. Pretty much, I was given a plate of chicken, some tortillas, and salsa for me to create my own tacos. I actually really liked this dish, and after I finished that, 2 tacos, and some guacamole, was pretty stuffed. Mercadito does serve up some solid food. Things are prepared with care, the restaurant itself is definitely a post-work gathering spot. The only downside is that it just breaks my heart that 4 tacos cost $14.50. In total, our dinner came out to be about $60 a person, which if I were back in California, could get me 8 super burritos.

We rented DIVVY bikes, rode up the river, failed at finding deep-dish pizza without a wait riding back to the hotel, and took advantage of the gym while alerted to the hot, humid, and heavy, hops-fueled antics of the wedding party via social media. We plotted a a more genteel, civilized evening to celebrate our last in this fair city.Downtown Chicago, as my cohort accurately noted, is a cultural desert comparable to New York's Herald Square, at least on a Sunday. And food was no exception. As she is primarily vegan, with compromises to pescatarian, Mexican seemed most probable. But nothing on any scale was open nearby within walking distance, including a highly rated Rick Bayless establishment.A Yelp search returned Mercadito... And this Los Angeles to New York transplant leapt immediately. It was a most pleasant multi-city transcendence. I have frequented the New York locations on many occasions, and this Chicago visit proved to be quite the exceptional competition. A short cab ride had us there in mere minutes, and at prime time to immediately catch a quiet outside table. And the experience just escalated from there. Every aspect of the evening was absolutely perfect, beginning with the service from start to end. Both the specialty and house margaritas were appropriately strong and distinctive. The guacamole and salsas delivered as well... And both the fish and shrimp tacos really excelled... I hate to prattle about taste and texture, but I can't help myself here. This was the kind of mouth-feel that fast food in all of its endeavors will never achieve.Forget the deep dish pizza...

This was the aroma and taste of the tropics, with awesome Serrano heat, and a healthy dose of El Tesoro. Yes please!I think everyone who stops here does two things: one - comments on the inability to be heard and two - orders the guacamole sampler, which I think works really well for a group of nibblers. Their standard guacamole was good, but I enjoyed the pomegranate. The taco sampler also works; there are plenty of options. We had the lettuce tacos and it has to be said that Mercadito has a ton of veggie options and can easily make things even more vegetarian for you, without complaining.We split a couple of dishes: the tilapia and the crusted chicken, which had wonderful flavors. These came with black beans and the chicken was accompanied by plantain rice. Most of this part of the meal we brought home. It was tasty.Our server was fine; but seemed to be spread a little thin. I do agree with my Yelp friends on the cost. Even though I didn't foot the bill, I put the tip down and we chalked up quite a dollar amount.

I especially love the Pera Te, Tres Viejos, Little Market, and Smokey Pablo cocktails. For brunch, I love the Guava Cava, Mango Mimosita, and Auntie Ox cocktails. I personally like sweeter concoctions and occasionally, some spicy ones. Luckily, Mercadito often melds sweet, savory, and spicy. My mouth and tummy thank you, Mercadito mixologists!Of course, one of their signature foods is the guacamole. The mango guacamole is my personal favorite. The granada is also fabulous; the pomegranate adds a lovely color and a nice bite! In terms of tacos, the camaron is my ultimate weakness! Spicy, saucy, and the shrimp is juicy. I'm not the biggest fan of seafood, but I can eat a million of these... and over the years, I probably am near the one million mark! The carne and pastor tacos are also winners. For brunch, their version of chilaquiles is yummy as are their enchiladas. I like their flan selection, and for me, the coconut is always a crowd pleaser. I often visit Mercadito with friends (for \"'girls'' nights\" usually! haha) and each time, the coconut bests the tres leches or goat's milk versions.

We came with a group of nine girls during our lunch break. I had heard great things and as Mexican is my favorite cuisine, I was VERY excited to try the food. We started with two appetizers of the guacamole trio, which I thought tasted great. After that, our entire experience was on the decline. We all ordered tortas for the most part. My friend's carnitas torta was brought out by itself. Another 5-10 minutes elapsed, and nobody else had yet been served their meals. After that, food slowly trickled out of the kitchen over a span of 20 minutes or more, until the only two people that had yet to be served were me and my friend next to me. At this point, we told the other girls to go ahead and start eating, and I walked up and made mention to the manager that our food had not yet come. After this, I would say 10 more minutes passed before we even got our food, at which point almost everyone else was done with theirs. After only a few bites, it was time to go. Welp, so much for that torta I was so pumped about. I would say over 30 minutes elapsed before the first and last person was served. Totally unacceptable. But the thing that I find most upsetting that I feel like it warrants a negative Yelp review is that I had the overwhelming feeling that we were just being overlooked. Our server, noticing that we still had not gotten our meals, pointedly ignored our table and avoided us altogether. When he finally came back, it took about 100 hours for him to bring us change. I mean, get it together guys!!I would love to say that I'd go back at another time to try to garner a better experience, especially because I know Mercadito is known for its night life, but I really just don't think that I would.

Our waiter was friendly and energetic, but obviously incredibly busy. He actually had forgotten he already took our ceviche order and got our taco order wrong, not a huge deal. The tacos were hit or miss for us. I really enjoyed the pastor and carnitas de puerco, while the carne and pollo didn't \"wow\" me at all.

First of all they have a wide variety of everything you want, and they are all excellent. They have like 6 different kinds of salsa, guacamole, different tacos. Each has unique flavors, very detailed. I love their chipotle on anything. They were very accommodating, giving recommendations, giving us extra chopped habanerofor the picante addicts at our table. The guacamole trio was great (the mango guac was the best), the salsa was spicy as hell, the tacos were awesome (try the mahi mahi or camarones), plantains came with jalapeno-ginger sauce. All delicious. Their cocktails are so creative and had flavored spice salt on the rims like cilantro salt on their watermelon cocktail. Amazing.I'm not usually a fan of trendified foods, but they are made so well here, I'm impressed and will return definitely.Word of caution, this place gets PACKED and is LOUD as hell.

We went on a Monday around 6:00 and it got busy fast. You'll most likely run into a wait once in awhile at a good restaurant in River North, it's going to happen so hard to see people giving any establishment 1-2 stars less because of that.There are some unique flavors and amazing twists on some classic Mexican eats. I've tried the traditional guac and chipotle and roja salsas with the house made chips and all superb. The guac isn't too thick and onions don't overpower. The chipotle has a little heat with a some sweetness to it while the roja isn't completely overpowered by the tomato and is complimented by the other ingredients. The albondigas (meatballs) were made to perfection and again complimented well. I've also had the carne and camaron tacos with the carne being just a touch dry on the meat and camaron tacos having a great sauce. The brochetas dish is good for sharing, but definitely tasty to the point that I could see wanting to keep it all to yourself. I've tried the mojitos, margarita, V-9, and smokey Pablo. I would order all again.Our server, Jesus, was exactly what you'd want in a waiter at a higher priced establishment and although busy he checked in on us several times without being annoying and accommodated any requests we made. Knowledgeable and great customer service.As others have noted it is a little higher priced. Compared to other tapa style places there is definitely a premium but pretty in line with other River North places. The seating in spots is extremely close to next table, like if you got up for any reason your butt may possibly be in the food of the next table. The only other item is that we've been here 4 times and the hostesses are a little inconsistent. Overall all good, but on our most recent visit the hostess didn't say much and although she was prepared to seat us, due to her lack of communication she ended up walking to our table all by herself and then came back and said oh I thought you were following me.

She's been trying to get me to come here since it opened and I always resisted. Today, she wore down my resolve.I got there before her as usual (I really need to stop being so punctual; it always bites me in the ass) and got a table in front. Immediately \"All You Need is Love\" started playing. Kind of an odd choice in a place like this. And why does Beatles music ALWAYS seem to follow me wherever I go?Anyway, my friend arrived and we studied the menu. Margaritas were the order of the day. That much we knew.The waitress, a dead-ringer for Snooki, came over and explained their different specialty margaritas. We settled on a pineapple one and a cucumber one and would share. Snooki then explained that the menu was small plates. I just wish this trend would die a slow death. All that means to me is that I have to order a bunch of stuff to be satisfied and my wallet will suffer exponentially.The cucumber margarita was unlike anything I've tasted before. I'm a huge fan of cucumbers, especially in cocktails. I love their clean, refreshing flavor. This margarita elevated the humble cucumber to a new level. The pineapple one was good too, but I didn't really taste too much of the fruit in it.We ordered a small guacamole to start. It was plenty good, but for $8.00, it was a criminally small portion. The chips were good, if a tad greasy.For our next course we ordered two kinds of tacos: pastor (pork) and carne (skirt steak), as well as a side of rice and beans. As expected, everything is a la carte which is how they nail you. I really wanted to order the elote mexicana ( Mexican style corn on the cob) that everyone raves about, but I didn't really want to gnaw like a beaver in the middle of a bustling restaurant. I save that for the privacy of my own home.The tacos were good, not the best ever, but certainly flavorful. I think the pork ones were tastier than the steak ones, but the garnishes may have been a contributing factor. The garnish on the pork one complemented the meat better. I did not care for the rice and beans. I thought the beans, which were black, were entirely too soupy, and the rice was simply white rice with a couple of carrots thrown in. It had no flavor whatsoever. I expect better for $4.50.I'll come back to Mercadito. The service was fine and the food was good. I do wonder if this place will be able to endure at this location.

I'm currently stretching my stomach in anticipation of eating my way through San Francisco. First up - one of Mercadito's signature Mezcal drinks. I had the Shady Gato (herradura blanco, averna, mezcal, fresh strawberry, lemon, and fantasia de naranja). I'll be honest, I don't know what half of those ingredients are but the fresh strawberry got me. It turned out to be an exquisite cocktail and very pretty, too. Definitely worth the $10!For appetizers, we went with the cheesy rice (it may not be on the menu, but just ask for this buttery goodness and you shall receive) and the trio of guacamole. We chose the tradicional, the mango and the toreado. All were really well done, though the coloring of the mango version isn't that appetizing. Just an observation we all made!We ordered four different tacos for the table so we could share. The server let us know that they come out as they're ready, tapas-style. Our selections included the carne (rosemary-marinated skirt steak with avocado), the camaron (shrimp with roasted garlic, chipotle mojo and avocado), the mole (sauteed chicken, sweet plantain, mole poblano and crema fresca) and the hongos (huitlacoche, wild mushrooms, manchego cheese and salsa verde). All were well-portioned and literally, every bite exploded with messy, unbridled flavor. My favorites were the shrimp and the mole, though I enjoyed them all (and by all, I mean four tacos total!) very much!We tried to avoid dessert, but our omniscient server knew we wouldn't be able to turn down the lure of torrejas de bolillo (creme anglaise, soaked Mexican bread, vanilla ice cream and cajeta sauce). Basically, it's a richer version of French toast and worth every sinful calorie. Can't wait to return! Dress to impress as this is River North after all.

Someone get me this recipe - STAT!The one thing that disappointed us surely was that we couldn't mix and match all of our tacos! We decided to get some mushroom taco, shrimp taco, mahi mahi, tilapia, and some steak. The tacos came out very quickly and we started mixing and matching all of our baby tacos.Had I not had some chips, guac, and salsa, I would have probably engulfed my tacos in all of two bites. Gradually getting fuller I also ordered some Victoria beer on draft. The tacos were fantastic and every bite was delightful. Don't underestimate the mushroom taco because frankly it's got the maximum taste of all of the tacos, which is not to say any of them are bad, but that the mushroom taco is a cut above the rest.For Sunday brunch, a great place to pass by the afternoon.

The cacahuate salsa, recommended by our waitress, was my favorite. \u00a0It tasted like a roasted peanut puree, which sounds awful, but was seriously crack-a-licious. \u00a0The veracruzana and habanero were great as well. \u00a0On the guac side, we had the calabaza, mole poblano, and another. \u00a0All were good, but nothing to write/text/tweet home about.Our drinks came 30 minutes later, which was when we started to notice delays in service. \u00a0All were fruitier than we expected and not as strong as I'd like, especially at $10+. \u00a0The Little Market was a nice fruity drink with an interesting chili powder on the rim, but had no trace of alcohol.We decided to hold off on ordering our tacos, because the waitress told us there'd be a 15 minute delay and we were still finishing our salsa and guac on our tiny lounge table. \u00a0We had to ask for more chips twice, because the baskets were small, and got annoyed looks from the staff each time.For our second round we ordered more drinks and 4 plates of tacos, per the waitress suggestion. She suggested one plate per person, since each taco is smal. \u00a0Glad that we came in a group of 4, we each ordered one and shared. \u00a0Tacos came out over a period of 45 minutes and the portions were indeed two-bite. \u00a0We ordered the carne, estilo baja, camaron, and mariscos. \u00a0My fave was the carne, which was smoky with grilled cactus and onions, cheesy with warm queso fresco, and chewy with deliciously marinated skirt steak. \u00a0The camaron was my second fave, simply prepared with shrimp in a flavorful chipotle mojo, topped with an amazing avocado slice. \u00a0The estillo baja came with fresh, crisp beer battered mahi mahi and the mariscos was a delicious chewy mess of octopus, shrimp, and scallops.Our waitress seemed to have forgotten our drink order, so we got our second round 30 minutes after ordering. \u00a0We had ordered less-fruity drinks this time and I preferred the Smokey Pablo, which had a lot of smokey flavor, was less fruity, but still had no signs of alcohol. \u00a0Others had the Pera T\u00e9, which was decent. \u00a0The waitress accidentally ordered two Smokey Pablos, so I had an extra drink, hurray.Decor inside was interesting, ranging from ropes hanging from the ceiling, to beautiful oil paintings and bathroom tile. \u00a0The bathrooms were single-use only, which meant for an awkward wait near the kitchen. \u00a0If I would go back, I'd definitely eat in the dining area, because the lounge chairs have no support and the tiny tables could barely fit our food and drinks. \u00a0The music was also very eclectic, with everything from Tear for Fears to The Bravery to a techno remix of Journey's Don't Stop Believing. Quite amusing. \u00a0The crowd was a mix of yuppies and older businessmen.Overall, the food is pretty good, with the peanut salsa and the tacos being excellent. \u00a0However, the portion sizes are awful for the price and service still needs some help. \u00a0Our waitress explained that she was busing more tables than usual, which leads me to wonder why there are 3 hostesses in the front instead of more waitresses. \u00a0To be fair, a personal measure of good service is whether my water glass was ever empty, which it never was. \u00a0Props to the water guy.Really wish I could give it 4 stars, but maybe next time. \u00a0But not on my dime.", "Date": "2009-09-22", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Steve T.", "ReviewID": "emo79PatFgiDCji5Ud4R8A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Alright, so, apparently they play musical dinner plates here...and musical dinner plates made me go WTF, quite literally, and I almost spilled my wine.

Unfortunately, I wish we had dined somewhere else.Mercadito does have a few things going for it. We were very happy to be seated at the exact time of our reservation. There is also a complimentary coat check, which is nice. The decor of the place is also very hip - they have just the right balance between light and dark. Very cool. And finally, the tequila selection seems to be pretty good.That's about where the good stuff ends. Our waitress was rude. I was practically yelled at for not wanting to order a drink right away. Sorry, I had not decided yet. I am not \"sick\" or \"crazy,\" I was just trying to figure out what I wanted. Then, when I tried to order my steak, I got yelled at again because I wanted it well done. Do you know why I always ask for it well done, waitress? Because I do not want there to be pink in the steak and bloodiness on my plate. And still, even when I order a steak well done it's still very pink about 80% of the time. After the waitress told me I should order it medium-rare, I insisted on well done. It still came out very pink. Awesome. We waited for-ev-er to get our check as well. Every time the waitress came to our table she was intimidating and acting like a jerk. Some tables might think that's cute and/or funny, but not us.Although I like the decor, I don't like sitting 2 feet from the table next to us. The music is too loud and some of the tables are too close to the bar. Speaking of the bar, there are no chairs at the bar, so if you are at one of the tables near the bar there will be people standing about 4 feet from you. So much for privacy. The bathrooms are single bathrooms so you may have to wait in a line that is close to the kitchen in a high-traffic area as well.And the food? Well, honestly, it sucked. My $25 pink steak was still flavorless - it certainly wasn't overcooked though! The guacamole appetizer was decent, but we only got enough chips to eat about half of it, and they didn't offer additional chips. And wait, no dessert menu? Oh well, I didn't want to give this place any more of my money anyway.All in all, we were VERY disappointed with Mercadito.

I recently held a cocktail party here and began communicating with the event coordinator (EC) and owner in Oct with regards to the event potentially being held in Dec. I plan a similar event each month at a new restaurant and, to date, have worked with about 6 venues, successfully. At first everything was fine. Responses were prompt and I met the EC in person to see the space/discuss details. The space was small, however the EC assured me that we could arrange the tables in a certain way to give us more space. I decided to push back the event until Feb since I knew our Dec crowd would be too large. They were excited and followed up promptly via email with a special cocktail and appetizer menu. Early Feb I reached back out in attempt to re-confirm the details (date and specials) and it all went downhill. I received no response from the EC. After 2 days, I sent another email. No response. I then left a voice mail, which was returned via email saying they were \"still working on it\".After a week of no response, I sent another email (copying the owner) stating that if I didn't hear back from them soon I would have to cancel the event (it was a week and a half away at this point). I received a 1-sentence email from the EC saying \"whatever we agreed on before is still fine\". Having planned events before and knowing the importance of getting things documented I wrote back asking, \"ok...so the specials are still xyz, correct?\" Also, I was still waiting on confirmation of the end time of the event and also that the space could be arranged as we previously discussed.After a day of not hearing back, I left yet another voice mail for the EC. After a total of 3 days, I crafted an email with a few \"choice\" words and was about to send it when I got an email from the owner asking if I had heard back from the EC. This was about my fifth clue that there was a chink in the armor.I expressed to him my discontent with the communication and service thus far, and also tried to confirm the details (after all- that's the most important thing). He responded promptly, apologized, and said he'd take over the event. However, he basically changed everything I had already discussed with the EC- he had the event time wrong, said he couldn't do the specials that had been \"confirmed\", and couldn't arrange the space as it had been discussed.I explained that the space wouldn't be big enough without the changes and that I don't bring 85 people to a restaurant that's not willing to offer us a special in return. I corrected the times but also assured him we would be out of the space when needed (which in effect cut our event at least an hour short compared to past events).He was willing to accommodate our requests. But then on a *hunch* I decided to make sure we were on the same page regarding the date of the event (I only spoke with the EC regarding this) and thank God I did. I got an email back saying that he thought it was another date, and that they could no longer host the event (in 5 days). He offered up another, smaller space- I said that it wouldn't work and that he had by EOD to tell me whether or not they could host. They could.At this point I wasn't expecting much, but I definitely wasn't expecting the rude and borderline slimy service that we received at the actual event. The owner, who said he would be there for the event, wasn't. When I got there, the manager on duty tried to increase the price of the drinks yet again, and also completely switched the food specials to a much more expensive offering. I explained that that wasn't what I had spoken with the owner about (and could prove via email), and he said sorry, but you're still getting a good deal. I eventually got the drink prices switched back but he wouldn't budge on the food. I didn't feel like arguing but let him know he would have a lot of unhappy customers who expected a different price.I had multiple guests throughout the night complain to me that the wait staff was rude and unorganized- forgetting orders, general snootiness. The manager also tried to convince me that the free appetizers we had been offered had been served which they hadn't. The icing on the cake was when, at the end of the event, the staff was literally shoving people out of the space and pushing tables into guests' backs and legs (a simple 'please move to the bar area' would have sufficed). I'm legitimately shocked at the horrible business that was conducted at this venue. I'm not sure how they do things in New York, but in Chicago guests get treated with respect and business is conducted in a professional, civilized manner. That would also entail that staff members communicate to each other and try to uphold some sort of honor. It's truly a shame, as the food here is good, but I don't think I will ever be back to this venue by choice.", "Date": "2010-02-28", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Caroline A.", "ReviewID": "rZiTWhn7Ufsg90QSJa5vqA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Confession: I've never really been a fan of Mexican food.

Guacs come first and we chose the pomegranate, traditional, and chile serrano varieties which ended up being a lovely mix of sweet and spicy. The chipotle salsa was delish. The carnitas (pork) and carne (beef) tacos were small but very good. The ceviches were...meh. Sides of green rice with melted cheese and fried bananas were hard to share and unfortunately for my fellow diners, closer to my side of the table. However, if the six of us would have placed our portions on a normal dinner plate, we would have been howling mad when we got the bill. It just is way overpriced for what you get. Whoever says otherwise, must not be familiar with the low cost of ingredients that go into making Mexican food. It was a friend's birthday and so I had to be there but never again. For my friend's birthday, the owner who he knows, sent a free round of tequila shots before our meal began. However, at the end of our meal the server said do you guys want another round of shots and even offered to drink one with us. EVERYONE at the table thought it was a comp round because of the way he presented the option. Well, our server who I will forever brand Luis el Bandido gave us his best tequila and charged us $105 for 7 shots - including his! How nice of him to treat himself on our dime.

In years past I could do whatever my heart desires. This year they gave my heart a limit. From what I could tell from their website, Mercadito had a tasting menu that would fit the bill. They also had several bar packages that would work for me to. At $33 a per person we had more than enough food to share....4 kinds of tacos, three kinds of guac, two kinds of salsa, chips, queso fun dido, etc. and then I just choice the drinks by person instead of a bar package because we only had 2 hours and most of us had to go back to work.The food was amazing, divine even and I'm sure I had a food-gasm.

So why did I have to go through all the trouble in advance? I also had a cake brought in to celebrate a new baby in the group and Mercadito had no problem serving that up. They even cut it up for us and repackaged the leftovers. I really wish the service had been on par. If so they would have surely earned that fourth star.

The last time we were there, we sat at the bar. It's first come, first serve and you can order off the full menu. Eating at the bar is an experience because you can talk to the bartenders and learn more about the restaurant and their favorite dishes. First off let me say that they have a very inventive drink menu. Right off the bat, I know I wanted to try b.n.g.t.m (big nose goes to mexico). They flip the lime inside out, fill it with liquor, light it on fire, and float it on top of the drink - talk about a show! And when you're ready, you just push it down (with a skewer) to put the fire out. Although it was a bit pricey (@ $13), it was worth every penny. I will most definitely go back for this drink.Now, let's talk about the food. When we were there, they have the $30 tasting menu for 2. It consisted of choice of 3 guacs, 2 ceviche, and 4 types of tacos (1 for each person), a side dish, AND a desert. I love the tasting menu, it's a great way to eat and try a variety of different dishes. My favorite guac was the mole poblano. It had a great smokey and sweet flavor to it. The ceviche was good, but it didn't blow my mind; the 2 we ordered was good and I would eat it again. The main part of the meal were the tacos. We ordered the: pastor, estilo baja, mole, and carne. My favorite 2 were the carne, and pastor. The only critique is that they were a bit salty. I think someone was a bit heavy handed with the salt when they were marinated. Besides that I loved all the favors. It was like a party in my mouth. For desert, we got the flan made with goat milk. It was very dense and sweet. Although according to our bartender, it was exactly how he remembered growing up in Mexico and that's enough of an endorsement for me! ;) I was stuffed by the end of this meal. I could barely eat the flan and only took a bit. We also barely touch the rice and beans we ordered so we took it home.

We had two vegetarians in the group and he was very accommodating with their requests and brought out vegetarian tacos for them. Loved the bus boy who kept coming around every 5 minutes to refill my water (as I was parched and dying from dehydration)--so I REALLY appreciated the water refills---that right there is good service in my book.My only complaint about Mercadito is that because we were a party of 7, we had to order from the tasting menu, which includes 4 kinds of soft tacos, 3 kinds of guacamole, two salsas, and 2 sides. The cheapest of the tasting menu options is $30 per person, which is the one we picked. It's a bit too much food but at least it gives you an opportunity to taste a bit of everything.

Unfortunately, we were in for a major letdown. Let me explain.Atmosphere: I was impressed upon arrival - Mercadito has great d\u00e9cor and looks very upscale. This place however is very loud, so I would not recommend it if you're looking for an intimate drink/dinner. \u00a0The layout and d\u00e9cor is fun and this would be a great place to come and grab a margarita with some friends, nothing more. There is a bar, but no seating. Also, the seating is very close to one another - I was sandwiched in between 2 people and could barely fit my purse between us.Food: I'm willing to compromise on some things if the food is good - however the food here was mediocre at best and pricey! We ordered the traditional guacamole & it was okay - bit of a lime taste and decent chips. For dinner, I ordered the carne asada taquiza - which came with a heap of homemade corn tortillas and my choice of two salsas - I went with the habanero (spicy) and the verde (medium). The steak was plentiful and juicy - but again, nothing out of this world. The tortillas were a bit stale and the salsas were bland. Zocalo has a very similar taco platter and it is seriously like 10 times better (AND you can pick up to 3 different meats) - and not to mention significantly cheaper. Also, there was no dessert menu.Service: Service started out great as we were greeted with complimentary coat check and were seated promptly at our reservation time. However, things promptly went downhill and this is Mercadito's downfall & the reason I will not be returning. The best way I can describe our waitress was... a bully. If we wanted rude, aggressive, air-head service, we seriously would have gone up a few blocks to Ed Debevic's. Once we were seated our waitress literally pranced over to our table and greeted us with a \"what's up?!\" I ordered a drink (traditional margarita), while my date did not. She then proceeded to say \"are you serious or crazy\" and asked if he \"was sick\" as to why he didn't want a drink right then and there. He did eventually order a drink, but seriously lady, back off. We thought that since we didn't really feed into her forward style of waitressing, she would cut the theatrics. Wrong. I asked her if I could get a side of the rajas without sour cream and she looked at me like I was crazy and said no. Then, my date asked for his steak to be cooked \"well done\" and she told him that it was supposed to be medium; however he proceeded to let her know that he didn't want it to be rare or pink inside so he preferred well. She kept insisting that he was ordering it wrong, and needless to say, it came back pink inside. She kept skipping us over and we waited over 20 minutes for the check. She then proceeded to sit down next to me on the booth to take the orders for the table next to ours - blocking me in since the seating is so tight you have to move the table over(which we couldn't do without squashing her (which we should have done in retrospect)). Oblivious, she went on sipping out of the other table's drinks, flexing her muscles (literally), etc. until we just pushed the table back ourselves & a nice bus boy apologized and helped us out from the table she was blocking us into. Seriously - this lady was a ridiculous joke.I echo other reviews in saying I'm not sure what the appeal of this place is.

Perfect blend of flavors in each. We got 2 veggie, one carnitas and one shrimp. The mushroom one was my favorite. The dish that stood out in my mind would have to be the dorado ceviche. The wafer-like crackers that came with it were a bit too soft for me as I'm used to a traditional chip crunch. There was plenty on the table though so I just used the leftover from the guac. We also ordered a variety of cocktails. They all had a smokey flavor. The consensus was the pepino el pyu was the best.

I understand this is a popular place, but it's been open for awhile and there are some major issues I have with the service that need to be worked out.For starters, I had friends (six) coming in town so I made reservations in Oct. for 12/16. On 12/14 I received an email saying that my reservations had been canceled by the restaurant. So when I called, they said a male had just called in and canceled them- which is entirely not possible, there wasn't even a male in my group. But the were able to reschedule them, for 15 min later. As they said, lucky for me... even though I didn't do anything.Then arriving at the restaurant an hour early to start having drinks, we told them we were there but would wait for our 8:15 reso. 8:15 rolls around and they said they were waiting for our table to leave but they had the check. 8:30, still waiting. 8:45, apologized but nothing they could do. Note: there were probably three empty tables that would have fit us at this point, not sure why there was just one we were waiting on. Finally sat us at 9pm and the hostesses were not nice about. When the waitress approached we apologized for being in a bad mood, but skipped the apps (I've had the guac before and it is pretty good, small portions thou) and went for the tacos. She did her best to help our moods with a few free drinks (half the party had stopped drinking bc their moods were no longer festive) and got our food.Our tacos were delicious, but after being starved we would have eaten anything at that point.

Unfortunately, for both of the tacos, I find the seasoning of the meat was too mild. I relate tacos with bold flavor meat countered by some salsa and sour cream. So, the tacos to me are overrated.

For dessert we had the ceviche de mango. This is where things got weird. It was brought to us in what I would describe as a cheesy, low rent Italian restaurant salad bowl.

There were three of us, but we ordered a ton of stuff so we could try various items. We started with guacamole (with queso fresco and pomegranate seeds), the shrimp and tangerine ceviche, and the queso fundido. The guac was pretty good, not heavy on the onion, and I liked the pomegranate flavor. Ceviche was promising, but was almost too sweet - I have have liked more of an acidy bite with it, but then, I think I prefer almost everything to be too sour. And the queso fundido was good - came out sizzling in a little cast iron skillet, with nice mild chorizo and a good salsa verde. The strike comes when you get the tortillas - they're small, thick, and supposedly house made, but I didn't think they were all that great. They're a bit doughy, and they don't have much corn flavor, to my taste. So they could definitely be better. Our tacos included the skirt steak, chorizo, and estillo baja. All were good, and with nice toppings. The skirt especially was perfectly marinated, great flavor and very tender. The slaw served with the estillo baja was nice and tangy with good dressing, and not too much raw onion, and the fish was nice and mild. In fact, I think there's a theme here - not too much raw onion. They don't seem to be cutting their dishes with it. It was in moderation sprinkled on tacos, in moderation in the slaw, and in moderation in the guac. Good for Mercadito. They do, by the way, have delicious fried plantains with a smoky sweet sauce. Good caramelized coating on the plantains, just excellent. Plus some interesting non-alocholic beverages - nice fuit juice and club soda mixes with a little lime. We had a mango and a pineapple, both were tasty. A nice change from the standard Jarritos.Service was very prompt - our dinner came out about 3 minutes after we ordered. And our waiter was very helpful in explaining things on the menu. They really do pack people in to the place, but we went on a Sunday night, so there wasn't a whole lot of traffic. And I should be careful to mention some exclectic tunes - at one point (to our delight) \"Regulators\" was playing. Mount up.As for the rating? Well, it's pricey, for what it is. I think of Mexican places I really love in Chicago, and if I wanted fancy tacos - as in, not the standard cheap (but usually still delicious) taqueria type tacos, but a little better class of ingredients, and with a little flair type tacos - I would go to Bien Trucha and pay far less for about the same, if not a smaller menu. And if I wanted more of a dinner? I would go to New Rebozo and pay less for better food. So I'm not sure I would go back. It would be fun go to with a group, but I can think of better destinations.

What a poor place to have a table. Put a potted plant in that space and keep the rest of the tables, but this little two-top is in a horribly inconvenient and inconsiderate place.

My socks were rocked off last night in a major way, mainly due to my company but Mercadito didn't disappoint. Few restaurants have given me the chills of utter elation, so congrats to you! We had a 9pm reservation on a Saturday night for 2 and waited for 20 minutes. That's not bad and we didn't mind because we just grabbed some drinks at the bar in the meantime. Note to self, if you don't like super crowded restaurants more resembling a lounge, with music blaring then this may not be the place for you. If you enjoy amazing margaritas, top notch tacos and other Mexican fare, nice tunes, and choice people watching then this is a restaurant you shouldn't miss out on!There's one bar located to the back on the right and it's tiny. I wish it were 3 times the size that it is because about 1/3 of that is taken up by the service well. Packed. Packed. Packed. It took us about 5 minutes to even flag a bartender. For some reason, it didn't even bother me.Just watching the bartenders work their magic with the wide variety of fabulous and colorful margaritas and all the mixings included, I was happily amused. Every drink being made behind that bar looked delectable. With an insane selection of tequilas, one should be quite happy as a clam.The decor was enough to keep me amused. Very chic, very sexy. Wild murals covered the walls and crazy light fixtures hung from all over. The location of our table certainly wouldn't have been my first choice. We were sat at a table about 15 feet in front of the bar. It's squished among 4 other tables and there are crowds of people standing behind you waiting to grab a drink. If you want to have a first date, hearing the other person talk about themselves most likely wont be possible. You also have to be as slim as gumby to fit between the tables. Next time I'll make sure I don't sit there!Our waitress was friendly and fun. It was hard to make much conversation with her other then asking her what she likes and having her order it. That's how I roll, especially in a restaurant where I can't hear anything but blaring music. We tried a variety of drinks but here are some favorites:* Smokey Pablo-cien a\u00f1os reposado, mango, chile morita, blueberry float (once you mix up the blueberry float, it becomes a delicious, sugary berry beverage) So don't order this if you don't like sweet!* Misty's Sleeve- el tesoro blanco, ginger, hibiscus, valencia orange, chile serrano, hibiscus salt (this one was more on the bitter side, and the hibiscus salt was very interesting)* Tres Coops- single village mezcal, st. germain elderflower, domaine de canton ginger, averna, lime, egg white (very refreshing!)* Dizzy Oaxacan- mezcal, grapefruit, lemon, ginger beer, bitters, cayenneOnto the food. Seriously by the time I had consumed about 4 margaritas I was starting to get full but I made room. Try the Guacamole. The portions are suited more for smaller groups. I felt the 3 guac choice would be fine for 3 people and under. We tried the Traditional, Mango and Granada. AMAZING. The Mango had chipotle in it and the two flavors together created harmony. Granada was bliss, mixed with Pomegranate seeds. How interesting! Loved it.The bottomless pit known as my stomach was at about 90% capacity and we hadn't even gotten the tacos and sides yet. The Mahi Mahi Tacos (Estilo Baja) were dropped on the table. Succulent beer battered fish with mexican cole slaw and chipotle aioli makes this taco a \"must order\". Great combination of flavor.Duck Confit (Pato) was the other choice. Pumpkin Puree with prune mole slathered on top. The duck was juicy and flavorful. Although there were many others I wanted to order, I felt our choices were pretty solid. 4 tacos come per order and it's $14.50, unless you order duck and that's an extra $2. If you're one who's prone to putting up a stink about expensive tacos, then save your breath and just dine elsewhere. I thought the prices were fine when stacked up to the quality I was receiving. For our sides we tried the Elote Mexicano, which was mexican style corn on the cob. Basically amazingness on a stick. It was sweet, covered in what seemed like sugar and cheese. Order it. No questions asked. We also ordered Coles de Bruselas, brussels sprouts with chorizo. It had great flavor, (and I'm not normally one to order brussels sprouts).Full wouldn't even describe my situation at this point but we needed desert to top it off. We tried Torrejas de Bolillo, creme anglaise soaked mexican bread, vanilla ice cream, cajeta sauce. Our waitress told us this was her favorite and boy was she right! I could eat this every single day.Overall, I'm very impressed.

The menu is ample and innovative, and the cocktail menu is vast. Most selections appear to pair well with most any selection. So certainly one can tell the concept is well conceived. There is concentration on flavor, and not to the point of obscuring poor quality of ingredient.That said, the service is disjointed. Given the price point, the locale and the competition, the service should measure to what one expects from the competition (ie Frontera).

Let's see, then we had a selection of their tacos, which were very tasty and filling. The pastor taco (rubbed pork and pineapple) was the winner of that race (if I go back I want to try the hongos taco, which has wild mushrooms). Their fried plantains were very juicy and delicious. The green salad side was fine but nothing special, so I wouldn't order that. For the dessert, we tried the bread pudding, chocolate something and the flan- hands down, the flan was the best because it came drizzled in caramel sauce and was lighter than the others, which was good after a fairly rich meal.A few caveats. The drinks were incredibly underwhelming. For starters, they served the margaritas in tumblers with tons of ice, so I felt like I wasn't even getting much. More than that, they just didn't taste that good-- all sweet and no liquor (and then diluted because of the ice).

The place was standing room only and a buzz of very loud music and people moving about. There were a lot of women here on girls night out dressed very well. We were a table of men and laughed about about the fact that the place was wall to wall women - from two suburban moms \"doing the town\" to Indiana tourists getting dressed up, to a family of tourists just taking in the madness. We ordered a mix of the tacos and some guacamole and a pile of margaritas. First let me talk about the tacos. These were good and very flavorful. They were very small on tiny little tortillas. Now, I have had these sorts of tiny tacos - in fact on my first trip to Mexico when a kid I was blown away by how little a tortilla can be.

Yes, they were very good. We ordered chicken, pork, fish, and beef and were very happy with the way they all tasted and the way they were prepared. So, while these were expensive tacos they were very good tacos. We also had an order of guacamole and some quesidillas and these were both good even if the guacamole was small. Overall it was a great dinner in a fun dynamic place that was just a buzz with a trendy girlfull feel. There is a nightclub or a bar in the basement, but a friend (not me) checked it out and we decided to pass. I did see that they have a Taco Tuesday like many other places in town, so perhaps this is worth checking out. One big problem on the night we were there: The music was TOO LOUD. It was annoyingly loud on the night we were there. We could barely hear the server describe the menu items. If you want even a moderate sound level, this might not be the place for you.

That's Mercadito. Mercadito clearly loves Mercadito. The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is that the sex, I mean food, was pretty good. Plenty of reviews talk about the food, so I'm just going to focus on my experience as a customer.I went there for lunch with a big group of co-workers, 11 of us in total. We showed up at noon, and the place was half full. It's a big space, but it wasn't quite the bustling scene I've seen there at night. First of all, our waitress took our drink orders - coke or iced tea? Really, those are the only 2 options we are allowed to have? Made their lives easier when they came to refill, but I really don't care. I stuck with water. Then she forced us onto the sharing menu, since we were such a big group. There were two options that were identical except that one had cevice and the other a botana option (quesadilla, etc.). Half of us wanted to do the cevice menu, half the botana, but the waitress insisted that we all have to get the same thing. When we started pushing back and even asked if we could just order off the regular menu instead, she responded by saying, with a straight face, \"we're one of the busiest lunch places in the city.\" Half the tables were empty the entire time we were there! Our entire table was pissed at this lady, and we would have almost definitely got up and left if we weren't such a big group. The crappiest part was that served each course split on two different platters, so it would have been ridiculously easy to let us do half cevice and half botana. Summary - I don't think I saw a single Mercadito employee smile the entire time we were in there. Least accommodating place I've been to in a while. \u00a0Food was pretty good but not worth $21.50 a head for a lunch of tacos and guacamole.

Everyone is wearing faded jeans, button-ups, slicked back hair, tight dresses, and heels. Its a lounge. Its filled with older guys and younger girls.

The taco's are basically these tiny little things with a piece of fish drowned in sauce with a slice of avocado on top.

The classic was just guac, there was a smoky one where I tasted maybe a hint of cumin?, that was the winner to me. The other two weren't my thing, sorry it's just mango guac doesn't do it for me. They then bring you four different tacos one at a time. The lamb taco was meh, off to a bad start. Then came the steak taco, very tasty and charred to perfection. After that one was the Tilapia taco, hands down my favorite. The fish was cooked perfectly and it was dressed with a tasty sauce that was simply delicious. And then came the carnitas taco, which was also very good. The carnitas were cooked nice and tasty, and it had a hell of a kick to it. I'm talking to where my nose was running. The main issue I had was the portions. The tacos were tiny, I mean it made Mexican street tacos look like the Super King Burrito at TBK. And for 7 people, they only brought out 2 small plates of pico de gallo and other garnishments.

The party planner at Mercadito and Tavernita, Wendy is just fantastic, she handled the actual reservation for me which was perfect and helped with organizing the menu, so no complaints on her. But here is what happened at the actual night of the party on Saturday.We came in at 8:30pm \u00a0with our party of 13 and our table wasn't ready, so in 10 minutes they wanted to seat us in an area where the table was super small and half the people would have to sit on these mini booth seats. With the amount of food we ordered, we could not possibly sit there. I asked the hostess if we could have another table and she said we would have to wait another 15 minutes for another table. Fine, no problem. Finally, we got sat at the main dining area which is really loud, but that's just part of the atmosphere here, also not a problem. What was a problem is that all our food was brought out super fast, faster than anytime. Taco after taco, two sides at once (since when does this happen). I asked both the guys bringing out the food AND our server to please slow it down as the birthday girl was getting quite upset. Well they didn't and we got the feeling that they wanted us out in an hour's time. For a large party who is paying a lot of money on a package with tax and tip plus drinks, we shouldn't be made to feel like we have to get out of here asap. So that was a disappointing experience.Now onto the food, I love it, always have, always will. The new Pancito, pork belly tacos are just the bomb .com! They are amazing, with orange and pickled and truly a sensation in your mouth. All the other tacos, the shrimp, carnitas, the fried plantains, the corn, all amazing, and let's not forget the best flan on the planet made with dolce de leche. SOO good. Knowing how good the food is, it is so sad that we had such a horrible experience with service.

Well, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that. I really don't enjoy sitting at dinner for 2.5 hours with only 5 people. It's somewhat odd. Unless I'm in Europe.

It means I can only put a dab on my chip.

Next, we had the quesadillas, which were more like empanadas...SO delicious!! One was filled with wild mushroom and the other with shrimp. They came on a bed of black beans. Amazing! Lastly, we had an order of the el pastor tacos (comes with four 3-bite tacos) and an order of the mole (chicken with plantain and mole sauce). Both were so delicious!! \u00a0Great to share. \u00a0We were stuffed after that. Probably could have skipped a plate of tacos or the dillas, but it was worth it for the variety. One of my favorite parts of the night was my drink that literally came on FIRE!!! So cool. It had the wow effect AND it was potent and delicious. Tequila, rum, fruity but not too sweet. It had a great seasoning on one side of the rim with salt and other spices. My only complaint was that the food came out a little too quickly... they could have spaced the courses out a bit more, but at least they were too fast instead of too slow!

I told her that it should only be 20 minutes, and she said that they couldn't seat us until a reservation cancelled. Okay, I get that. What I don't get is why you told us it would be a definite hour long wait, when in reality, there was a chance we wouldn't get seated for the rest of the night. After finishing weeks of exams and wanting a nice night out, Mercadito completely ruined it for me by being this evasive.Oh, let's not forget to mention there was a row of TEN TABLES that were empty the whole time we were there. We could have eaten and left before anyone with a reservation showed up there. When we left, no one was even being seated there and it was untouched.

I had never been here before and frankly didn't know much about Mercadito, other than I had heard vague rumblings that it was a fun place to go and they had decent food, and it's not far from my office. So I sat down at the bar and there were only a few other folks in the restaurant. The bartender asks what I want and I said, I have no idea, what do you recommend. I told him I'm into spicy drinks (ala bloody mary) and he recommends a Misty's sleeve. The hibiscus salt is great and it has a bit of heat. I told him, if anything, make it spicier next time. A few more folks show up at the restaurant and I can feel the vibe start to pick up. It's around 6:30 at this point. Done with the Misty's Sleeve, I'm up for something else. Another bartender recommends the Big Nose Goes to Mexico (B.N.G.T.M), which they described as a sort of Mai Thai with a twist. The twist being 151 and set on fire before you drink it. It's a really fruit drink, but still delicious and the hibiscus salt on the rim of this one is a little burnt, which gives it another layer of complexity. It's around 7 and the place is really crowded. My wife arrives and we're immediately seated outside. It was a beautiful night and there's lots of folks walking around River North. I order another Misty's Sleeve and my wife has a BNGTM. She's not really a fan of the salt on the glass, but still enjoys the guava-ness of the drink. We ordered the Mango, Pina, and Mole guacamoles to start. Surprisingly the Mango and Pina are the spicier of the three. The mole has a nice smoky taste, while the other have sweeter, but spicier notes. All three are delcious. Then we had the Hongos and Pescado tacos. The Hongos tacos came out first and were absolutely delicious. Earthy mushrooms and really savory. The Pescado tacos came out next, but they weren't as flavorful as the Hongos.

But at least we could taste a difference between the 3 of them.Ceviche - shrimp and mahi-mahi. I don't know how they even call this a ceviche, because the seafood is cooked. Bland.Tacos - the only one anyone cared for were the steak ones. Every other one was pretty bland and basically was just some meat on a tortilla, no onions, tomatoes, anything.

I made reservations for my party 2 weeks in advance providing them with my choosing for the sharing menu ($35 pp). When we were seated and ready to be served, surprisingly, our waiter had only received half of my sharing menu. Thank God for email, so I quickly retrieved my sent email to the party planner from a week ago, and we were back in business.-I am a FREAK when it comes to being prepared for things & as this was my Bday party I slightly began to have a mini meltdown thinking that this could only get worst2. I had a confirmed party of 17 and as the last 3-4 ppl trickled in, we realized that there was clearly only enough seating for 13 ppl. Again, I panicked & this time the manager came over to speak with me. -Hands down, the manager (Dan-I think) handled this issue with complete respect and sincere apology about this situation...this put a smile on my face & within 5 minutes, he made room for the rest of my guests quickly resolving this issue. THANK YOU MANAGER.PARKING:Forget about it lol...or Valet, if you have a later reservation like I did (9pm) if people are driving make sure they arrive 30 minutes earlier to guarantee them a decent street park...but I recommend valet.Overall, I love this place despite the expensive as F prices! You pay for what you get and our server/service, quality of food and ambiance were ALL ON POINT....until we got out bill! lol Our bill came out to be $1100...In hindsight, I would recommend this to future party goers...MAKE SURE you're party opens a tab and/or orders their alcoholic drinks at the bar. Not only are the drinks expensive as hell (but amazing) this increased the taxes and gratuity making the rest of my party having the fork over more money.Make a long story short, I HIGHLY recommend this place for a cool date, BDay celebration or anything interactive w/ ppl. Please make sure you come prepared to fork over a hefty penny but leave feeling that the service and atmosphere was well worth it!", "Date": "2011-07-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Tripti S.", "ReviewID": "a7-GHj5CJ_IO9L64-WiyhA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really yummy guacamolesDrinks were good.I am vegetarian and so I ordered Rajas tacos.

Speaking of which - the mango guac is a MUST HAVE. Ever since I've returned home, I've been dreaming of it. Now that I think of it, Mercadito should come out with a cookbook like so many other popular restaurants do (e.g. Grazie in Toronto).

The food was \"good,\" although with Rick Bayless just down the street, I don't know what these clowns were thinking when they selected the location. Chicago is chock-full of upscale Mexican joints, and this is just another one on the list. The food is good, but I had some gripes: the pastor tacos were salty, the tacos estilo baja were strange and the fish quality was poor, and the caldo de camaron had a tasty broth but the tiny frozen shrimp out the Trader Joe's bag were tough and overcooked. For me, the key to a good restaurant is doing the not-so-little things right (not oversalting/overcooking basic foods). Also, this spot should be in the Randolph row of restaurants, or even the South Loop; it has no business being Rick's neighbor.I did enjoy the chipotle (brown) guac and the \"Auntie Ox\" drink.Now, let's talk about the service. The waitress was a little flaky and was nowhere to be seen after we placed our order. The plates kept spitting out of the kitchen, which were spaced nicely, but we had this industrious waterboy who probably visited our table a good 20 times during the meal. If anybody's glass would so much as drop to 3/4 full, he'd be on it like white on rice, and his approach lacked finesse so our table had water drops scattered everywhere by the time we were done. I know the opposite is much worse, an empty water glass, so it wasn't really a problem per se, rather something to give us a laugh.I think what I'm going to do with this place is use it as cocktails/guacamole stop. They have some nice outdoor seating which will be great in the summer. Perhaps if I had an office nearby, it would be a decent spot to take people to lunch. When I need some haute comida mexicana, though, I will be calling up Rick or going to Mexique or Salpicon. Mercadito might think its legacy in NYC and Miami is enough to win over the Chicago market, but we've kept Rick to ourselves around these parts for ten years, and we're not looking for a Team 6 anytime soon.

It is a bit more costly to eat here, the dishes come with about four tacos each, but don't be deceived! You will get full...and it is quality food. I've tried most of their tacos. Tacos that stand out..the pescado tacos, just the right size for the taco, most of all, it HAS flavor, with the poblano tomatillo on top, and I remember very distinctly, a sliver of fresh avocado-it makes for the perfect bite! They also had another fish taco, beer battered mahi mahi which I would recommend. Their tacos al pastor was good as well. Another item from their menu I would like to point out is their guacamole.They really try to be creative when it comes to their guacamole and I recommend trying their mango version. (Don't try the manzana guacamole, reminded me of the texture of durian...) For drinks, I would try the micheladas, rimmed with the salt/spices. YUM! Pros: good dining experience, good food, great decor and atmosphere Negatives: sometimes loud, depending on what night/time you go (later in the night)...may not be the best place for a date at that time.

I told the waiter of my disappointment and though he was friendly he only profusely offered an explanation of how the price was actually $27 and they were really kind of starters to share anyway. Since he wasn't on the ball, I told the manager of my issue and he(!) went off into a discussion about how things were actually meant to share and so forth. Management needs to understand that (in the United States), customers have really high expectations, and while I don't mind hearing the management's viewpoint about a problem, I clearly expect them to do something for me. And it wouldn't hurt if they could maybe, possibly, acknowledge that my concern is reasonable (i.e. that item does not belong on a \"main courses\" part of the menu).The man was friendly enough and offered me his card \"to make sure everything goes well next time\", but I was a little surprised in an upscale, trendy place not to have received some sort of financial accommodation - I still wound up paying $27 (and tax and tip) for something that was much less than their (good) $15 taco plates.

Being vegetarian we're always a little worried walking into a new restaurant, not knowing how accommodating they will be with our \"can you take that off or add this\" requests. Let me tell you that we have yet to find a more accommodating place. Not only is the menu clearly labeled with their vegetarian options, but they are way more than willing to create vegetarian versions of non-vegetarian menu items.For my parents 30th wedding anniversary we covered an all expenses paid weekend in the city which included dinner here. We gave them a pre-paid gift card and when they sat down all they did is tell the waiter that they had never been there before, that they were vegetarians and the waiter said, \"no problem - I've got it\" and he just kept bringing them vegetarian dishes until they couldn't eat anymore. My parents were so thrilled by the experience, my father walked out with a \"the taco that changed my life\" t-shirt.We recently brought my brother and sister-in-law here for dinner and they had the same amazing experience we've had every time. Did I mention they have the best margarita in the city? They do. They also have amazingly creative and delicious variations that change from time to time.I've also attending a cooking class here as part of a corporate event. The cooking classes are WELL worth the money. Their head chef cooks in front of you, explaining how he makes some of your favorite dishes. I think they're around $75 per person (don't quote me, because I didn't have to pay for myself when I went to it) but this is what we got with it... A 5 course meal, one full size drink came with each course, in between courses they handed out shot glasses filled with different types of tequila (three total), plus they raffled off prizes including full bottles of tequila, t-shirts, and day of the dead sugar skulls and you leave with all the recipes.

It tasted amazing, but again, presentation was wierd.The Cons:-Prices are kinda out there for what you get, but in that area of the city, that is to be expected-Having to get 4 of the same types of taco's in an order, and not being able to try different kinds. Ususally at most mexican places you can try one chicken, one beef, etc etc, but not here. You have to get 4 of the same, and that sucks.

We also ordered the queso fundido, along with the carne, pollo, and camaron tacos. It was all very good, especially with the small corn tortillas. Instead of eating those jaw breaking chips, I just put everything into the tortilla and it was perfecto! My least favorite taco was the skirt steak (carne). I think it was something about the flavoring, and I'm just not a fan of skirt steak. Also, for my friend's birthday, we brought along small cupcakes to celebrate and it was great that the wait staff immediately came with a lighter and plates so we could celebrate! I LOVED THAT!

Mine were absolutely delicious. I very unhappily shared one with my BF-I did not want to give any away it was so good! The pastor tacos were pretty good but extremely spicy, so beware. When you order the tacos meal, you get four tacos. However, I was kind of bummed that you could not mix-and-match.

We also ordered a side of the elote, which came as two 1/4 corn cobs on sticks.

If you're looking for bland, unseasoned food, this is the place to be. First, making reservations for a certain time didn't help as we got seated forty-five minutes after our allotted time. Upon entering the place, I envisioned a Latin fusion, trendy type of place with Latin rhythms and sounds playing in the background. What we saw and heard was a club type of atmosphere, people yelling across their tables trying to carry on a conversation because the music was thumping so loud \u00a0like we were in a the hippest place of a hip hop scene. Now I might be a little old school, or hallucinating but every time I've visited a Latin joint, I hear the sounds and rhythms of the country or countries it's food is trying to replicate or take to a new level. Trying to carry on a conversation with my wife and friends over a hip hop music, eating bland, tasteless guacomeles, salsas & ceviches was not the experience I was hoping for. If you want some Latin fusion or close to authentic, without the club atmosphere, Don Julio's or other similar places are a safer bet. Now I have to say the drinks were not bad, however the beer selection was limited and as I scanned the bar, so were the choices or liquor. Mostly Latin infused drinks, only \"cervezas\" as I was told from the bartender. She should've said \"only Mexican cervezas\" because that's all they had. Anyway, our waiter seemed to forget about our small table once a group of twenty or so were seated next to us. When I asked for extra chips for our table, it took them fifteen minutes to bring them out. Decor was nice but I toned it out after our experience.

The mushrooms were substantial and, when combined with the cheese, had an enjoyable texture. The chicken tacos were brilliantly paired a delicious mole. It kept it simple but didn't sacrifice taste.

The two birthday girls chose Mercadito and spoke quite highly of it. I'll admit, I entered skeptical seeing as the reviews for this place are very mixed, but I hoped to fall on the love side of the love-hate divide. Our server was very nice, he explained that the plates were smaller and intended for sharing. He ended up being very attentive throughout the meal. We started out with the shrimp ceviche. I'm not wild about ceviche, it always falls short with me and this was really no exception, I did like the flatbread it was served with though. We also ordered guacamole, which I don't like, but it received rave reviews from the rest of the table. I was torn between the shrimp, mahi and tilapia tacos, but settled on the tilapia ones because they were grilled, not fried. I also ordered the arroz verde - green rice with cheese. When they started delivering our food I got excited; the carnitas, carne and mahi tacos arrived and looked quite good. The tacos weren't huge, but they were generous with the proteins and toppings. Then my meal came... I had the aforementioned reaction because here is what I got for $10.50 (or $3.50 per taco) - 3 mini tortillas with a portion of tilapia on each about the size of a flash drive. Each taco was covered in sauce and had a sliver of avocado that may have been thinner than a pencil! From a taste perspective the tacos were excellent, the sauce on them was amazing. From a value perspective they failed miserably; my tacos were so skimpy I could have rolled the tortilla around the fish at least 1.5 times. I also could have eaten at least one more plate of them and I wasn't abnormally hungry; the idea that this plate was meant for sharing is a joke. If a co-worker had attempted to take a taco I would've stabbed them with my fork (does that qualify for worker's comp?). The arroz verde was disappointing too - too cheesy and bland; I was happy I ordered it, otherwise I would've needed to grab a snack to make it all the way to dinner. The dessert menu didn't strike my fancy so I passed, but my co-workers split the torrejas de bolillo. It got good reviews and did seem like a portion suited for 2 or 3 to share. You won't find me racing back here, especially on my dime. There are plenty of other great Mexican restaurants in the city, I just don't find this a good value for my money especially since everything (including chips and salsa) is a la carte.

The first and most important, it was about 100 degrees in the restaurant. My face was flushed the entire time and my other party guests felt the same way. Second, the drinks took a long time to come out. I believe we were halfway done with our app before our first round of margaritas came.

We followed the advise of our server, and kept the game plan simple - keep the tacos and margaritas coming until we say stop.Since it's been a while it might be hard for me to recall all the different tacos. I know we loved the carne, and I liked the mahi mahi. The others were good on a varying degree. If you've been to Mercadito before you know they love their drinks - and so do we. My favorite is the pepino el pyu (tres generaciones blanco, cucumber, lemon, hoja santa, cumin salt). The cucumber is a fun and refreshing twist to a margarita. We also really ate a lot of the chips, salsas and guacamole. The spicy salsa was my favorite (I think the one with peanuts), and the gaucs were also very tasty. I almost forgot, we also started with a few ceviche dishes the cleanse the palate between spicy salsa, gaucamole and our trays of tacos (not to mention it goes great with the drinks). There was ONE non taco dish ordered - the carne asada. Darn it was good: deliciously seasoned and cooked to order. Next time I go I think I might try a non taco dish.It was a successful evening in all regards - good food, good drinks, good value and a good crowd.

Food:I had the chicken taco, braised pork taco, steak taco, and battered mahi mahi taco. Chicken came out as the unanimous winner from our table. The moral of the story for the rest of the tacos is that they are dry and lacked enough of that punch you're looking for when you're paying 14 bucks for 4 small tacos. The solution is to buy the special salsas they sell, which you then lather all over the taco and pretend it was naturally that flavorful by itself. The point of the matter is that getting any small thing from this restaurant is like pulling teeth. Each order of salsa, which was about 3 bucks for a single order of salsa, is approximately 4 tablespoons of salsa. Do not go with people who do not understand the art of sharing. Guacamole, which was about 8 bucks for a single serving, was envisioned to be served to perhaps a small pet: about 1/2 cup of guac per order. Long story short, the chef had great ideas about sharable foods, but either failed to deliver on the great part or failed to deliver on the sharable part. Service:I can only say that the service was a little hilarious. You see, Mercadito is a place of rules. - No you may not sit at the table for more than 1 hour... you must move in an hour if someone had that table reserved. So shove that overpriced food, unworthy one.- No you many not order different kinds of tacos on one dish. To try the steak tacos, you must order at least four. To mix and match different tacos in an order is apparently physically impossible and the restaurant might explode. - At the Double A bar downstairs, which I will call the Butt Bar, because their emblem looks like a set of buttcheeks, is apparently \"much more sophisticated than the upstairs,\" said the waitress there. As a result, we are not allowed to order such lowbrow drinks offered by the upstairs, when we are sitting in the downstairs area. Instead, what we are allowed to do is tell them that we would like a drink that has exactly the same ingredients as a drink from upstairs, and would they please use the exact same ingredients in the same proportions? This inquiry is ok. Just don't try to ask for the same drink by name, as it would show yourself as too uncultured to be served at the Butt Bar. - We were reminded continuously that \"we are a different place,\" by the staff of Butt Bar, even though they served the exact same food menu, and was connected to it by a staircase that the bar staff pretended not to exist. Miscellaneous:- The drinks were interesting, and I would go there for the drinks alone. \u00a0Nothing compared to the Drawing Room, but nice twists and flavors of cayenne, fire, and secrets, according to their menu. - The lighting in the bathrooms downstairs are appropriate if you possess infrared vision.

These are some words that could describe my experience at Mercadito. I've been here twice in the past 4 days and already planning my next visit. I enjoyed their traditional guacamole, rock shrimp and three different tacos (Steak, Shrimp and Beer battered mahi mahi with jicama slaw). The mahi mahi taco is my absolute favorite and I will crave it till I get sick of it. For dessert I had the creme anglaise soaked mexican bread,vanilla ice cream with cajeta sauce and almost fell out of my seat. I would consider coming back just for dessert so I can eat this. Think of french toast with ice cream on top served in a cast iron skillet. Aside from the amazing food their traditional margarita (I like it with a splash of OJ) completes the meal and could have you walking out sideways. Our server AJ was awesome, super friendly, attentive and gave great recommendations. The only down side was portion size and price. This place is $$$ for \u00a0tacos. I will not compare it to $1.50 tacos from Las Asadas because I know better, but $14.50 for four mini tacos? Common, I know it's delicious but that's still a little steep. We spent $100 for two people on just apps, drinks and tacos.

Good Drinks? YES Spicy Food? YES Ambiance? YES We arrived right on time for our 8:30 reservation and the place was hopping - every table full and a crowd around the bar (but enough room to stand/order drinks at the bar - not to worry). We were greeted by the lovely hostess and asked to wait a few moments at the bar until our table was available - we were quite OK with this. We each ordered one of the specialty tequila drinks to start and the best part may have been watching the bartender kick-ass making 5 different drinks at one time! AH-MAZE-ING. She lined up five different shakers right up on the bar and her arms were flying left and right pouring different tequilas & mixers into each. Then it was shaking time - I have no idea how she did it - and each of our 3 drinks tasted delicious. I had the smokey pablo which was unique in its smokiness, but I could only have a sip of it as it was not to my taste, but definitely worth a try. Right as our drinks were being handed to us we were seated at our table which although small, was big enough for the 3 of us and most of the food we ended up ordering. Since it was restaurant week, we were able to choose 3 gaucs, 2 ceviches, 4 tacos, 1 side and 2 desserts for the table as well as 1 cocktail apiece - all for only $40 per person (I tried to add it all up if it weren't restaurant week and I think before tax our total would have been about $140, so we saved about $20 - I'm down with that). OK, now for the important stuff - how was the food? Well let me tell you, it was tasty! We started with the tradicional (so refreshing, so flavorful - perfect texture), toreado (not the best looking - kind of a muddy green color, but had a bit of a kick) & granada (pomegranate was out of season so they substituted strawberries - I just wasn't impressed with the texture or the flavor of this one) guacamoles - favorite listed fist. Next came the ceviche (quick note, the bread served with the ceviche was quite delicious, almost like a cracker that doesn't make crumbs everywhere - don't know what it was but the texture complimented the ceviche perfectly). We had the dorado & callo ceviche - the dorado was so refreshing and light tasting with just enough citrus - yum. The Callo was alright, but I didn't love the grapes with it - it made it a little too sweet for my taste. (By now we are already starting to get full - no worries about there being enough food at this restaurant during restaurant week) Taco Time! We had Carnitas de puerco, rajas, hongos & camaron (I was with a vegetarian friend, so we opted to try only 1 with meat, 2 with veggies & 1 shrimp). I love meat, so my favorite by far was with carnitas - it was so perfectly shredded, *Spicy*, juicy, delicious - more please! The other 3 were just OK for me - the shrimp was a bit too smoky flavored for me and way too much sauce, the rajas was tasty but I really wanted a protein with those beans and the hongos was unique, but nothing I felt I needed to eat more of. For a side we ordered the arroz verde which I found to be underwhelming due to the mushy texture of the rice, but I couldn't pass up the chance to eat something topped with melted, gooey chihuahua cheese! (We took a breather here and ordered a round of drinks - so much food and it kept coming out one dish after another - it was almost overwhelming) Round 2 of drinks - I played it safe and ordered a margarita tradicional - you can't go wrong with this if you like margaritas. Dana G. ordered pepino el pyu which was by far the best tasting beverage of the night - so refreshing - if you like cucumber at all you must try this! Candice G. ordered a shady gato which was a little on the sweet side, but also refreshing - all of these drinks were better than the smokey pablo. So dessert, really? We don't have room for this, but since it was included, we forced ourselves to order the chocolate cake with chiles and a raspberry cheesecake and boy were we ever glad we made room. The cheesecake was light, airy, fluffy and not at all dense as some cheese cakes can be. The chocolate cake had a perfect harmony of spice/sweet/chocolate but was very rich - a couple of bites were more than enough. Overall our server was attentive but not in our way, the atmosphere did not feel like a typical Chicago restaurant - the vibe is much more energetic and fun, the food was good and the drinks were great.

I think that the restaurant is already very aware of reputation because we had some interesting experiences with the staff. \u00a0The menu is made for sharing, I'm not generally a fan of this as I am pretty protective over my plate of food and it's a little odd in a Mexican restaurant. \u00a0They have like 15 different taco options which come in sets of 4. \u00a0You can add on a taco or two if you want to share with larger groups but you can't mix and match tacos. \u00a0 So if you just want some tacos for yourself you have to get 4 of the same instead of being able to sample different kinds. \u00a0They also have a couple of yummy looking salads, 4 different ceviche options, small and large plates.

Finally, the food and drink. Overall, I liked them, but some things annoyed me. I ordered a margarita that came with \"fire\". Yes, it was flaming. I'm not really down with that sort of thing, but especially when I have to put the fire out MYSELF! Um, hello- fire code anyone? And the glass was burning hot! The drink itself was tasty, but for $13, I expect less ice (more than half the glass) and more booze. I'm kind of a lightweight. One drink hits me, but two - forget it. I had two margaritas and woke up this morning as if I hadn't drank in a week. \u00a0We ordered the mahi mahi ceviche which was yummy, but not out of this world. I really didn't like the cardboard-y flatbread it came with, though. The guacamoles were good - we tries 3 different kinds. I'm usually a guac-purist, but I loved these.

On the one hand, I thought the food & the service were really great. On the other hand, the closeness of the seating, the loud & cavernous space, and the quickness of the arrival of our app's & entrees making the meal feel very rushed, were not so great.Let's start with the positives. The food was really delicious. My dining companion and I did the restaurant week menu which consisted of 3 guacamoles, two ceviches, 4 tacos, and a dessert. Of the 3 guacamoles (traditional, mango, and a mole poblano), only the mango left something to be desired. The other two were really good - especially the traditional, they nailed it for me. The two ceviches we ordered were the shrimp and mahi mahi and they were both on point. And I love me some ceviche - anywhere I can get it I order it. And these were a couple of the better ones I've had in Chicago. For the tacos we went with the pastor, mahi mahi, shrimp, and mushrooms. THe mahi mahi was the star - the fish was crispy and the sauce complimented it perfectly. The shrimp was also tasty but oddly spicy (it had good flavor, but was just a little to spicy for this girls weak palette). I was not a fan of the mushroom taco though. I love mushrooms, they would be a part of my last meal in some capacity, but the taco was just mushrooms and very little other flavor. I thought this was going to be the stand out and was disappointed that it was just....boring. I did not try the pastor as I don't eat pork but my friend gobbled it up without complaint, so I'll assume it was good!Our server was also fantastic. She was quick with our drink order, which BTW the margaritas are fantastic, and she let us take our time in ordering. Now the negatives. The biggest issue was that the tables are so close together they might as well have just made the seating communal. The tables are literally about 6 inches apart. In order to seat people, the diners at the next table would have to stand up and move so they could pull the tables apart to get others in/out. And I wasn't the only one that thought this - the parties on either side of us remarked at how close the tables were. In fact the 3 girls sitting next to us said something to the affect of 'I guess were going to become good friends tonight since we are practically dining together'. It just felt very awkward to be trying to have a conversation with your dining companion while having to tune out the folks around you because they were so close you could hear every word of their conversation. The other issue for me is the noise level. It was just very loud and you felt like you had to talk in an outside voice to be heard, which was also awkward because then you felt like you were disturbing the diners next to you in talking loudly. My last complaint, and this might just have to do with it being restaurant week and them having the restaurant week menu items pre-prepared, but everything came out so quickly. Within 5-10 minutes of ordering we had the guac's, the ceviches, and the first of our tacos. It felt very rushed and we didn't even have time to enjoy the appetizers before getting the entrees. THe rest of the tacos came out within about 5 minutes and we finally had to ask them to bring the last one back a bit later because our table was so full, there was no room for it. I like to enjoy a meal and not get there, sit down, order, and be done eating in 30 minutes and that's about what we could have done. It was just not relaxing at all.Now the million dollar question - is would I go back? Yes, but probably only for lunch when they might not be so busy. Which would bring the noise level down and hopefully afford you a table without folks sandwiched next to you.

Dinner : husband ordered la tampique\u00f1a which is like a skirt steak great seasoning, the sauce is delicious, and it was serve in a bed of Brussel sprouts and potatoes super good , I got the mole tacos , they were little tacos but the most flavorful tacos ever! sooooo good !!!!DRINKS!!!!!!this is when I was sold had the best margarita ever and to make it more exciting it was on flames hahahaha its called big nose goes to Mexico , it had two or three different types of tequila , it was fruity but not too sweet and it was serve with a flame on top Yuuummmssss!!!!!!!! \u00a0Iam coming back with my friends next time to check out the lounge that is located right downstairs !!", "Date": "2013-03-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Deborah J.", "ReviewID": "-xYYzG-WQVhsBATvnhyGXg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm writing this review after having had a tasty but basic taco at a little mom n' pop place, and I've had a revelation: there is no sense in comparing tacos to tacos if it means comparing your basic taqueria to Mercadito. \u00a0Listen, one of the taquerias I used to frequent in San Francisco (I grew up here, went east, then west, then landed back in the Midwest) was first introduced to me as a place where \"you find God in a burrito.\" \u00a0I truly believe these sorts of moments exist, especially in San Francisco at 3 in the morning when you're a wee bit tipsy. \u00a0But the thing is, when you find that miraculous burrito, you've got a beer or horchata in the other hand. \u00a0There aren't any burritos at Mercadito, nor is there much beer, nor is the fare drunk food. \u00a0It is open until 3 a.m. on Saturday night, but that's not what this place is about. \u00a0While you might not find spiritual enlightenment in the $14.50 tacos, you still might swear you're in heaven. \u00a0So dress for the occasion.But about my visit. \u00a0I ended up here with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and my mom on a Wednesday night. \u00a0The noise level was a bit much for my mom, I think (she also hadn't seen me in awhile, so it was more of an issue), but it should be fine and festive for most of you Yelpers. \u00a0We started off with drinks (I had Misty's Sleeve -- tesoro blanco, ginger, hibiscus, valencia orange, chile serrano, hibiscus salt -- and even at $12, it was revelatory) and a couple guacamoles, which were served with crispy, perfectly salted, non-greasy housemade chips. \u00a0The 'classic' was refreshing, but the chile serrano and tomatillo laced 'toreado' was much more exciting. \u00a0I suppose they complemented each other nicely, but I'd pick the 'toreado.'We moved on delectable watermelon and chile infused scallop ceviche, which, with its lightly spicy sweetness, was a highlight for me. \u00a0The ceviche was served with a baked flatbread, also, I suspect, baked in-house. \u00a0While not quite the right complement for the ceviche, the queso fundido (baked Oaxaca-manchego cheeses; we got ours with chorizo) was likewise delicious. \u00a0I'm picky about melted cheese, and there's nothing worse than a grease puddle. \u00a0The melting of flavors and consistencies was, in this case, splendid, and the fresh tortillas were just the right temperature and texture. \u00a0After that, we moved into taco and tostada territory, electing shrimp for the former and mushroom for the later. \u00a0I was honestly a little disappointed by the tacos; I seem to recall really nicely seasoned shrimp topped with a little avocado, but nothing else. \u00a0The shrimp were tasty, for sure, but the avocado wasn't quite balancing the pungency of the garlic and the chipotle, and, you know, there was just something missing. \u00a0The tostadas, however, were fantastic: woodsy mushrooms and earthy pinto bean mash, heightened with tomatillo salsa, finely shredded manchego, and a light crema fresca scented with epazote. \u00a0All on a perfectly crisped corn tortilla, of course. \u00a0I would order this again in a second. \u00a0(Note: tacos come in fours, but tostadas in threes; our excellent -- a rare medley of friendly, chill, and super competent -- server noted this and we added an extra tostada to our order.) \u00a0I was pretty well stuffed at this point, but we couldn't pass up dessert. \u00a0Another reviewer mentioned torrejas de bolillo, and I'm sad that I didn't have the opportunity to try that. \u00a0On the night that I went to Mercadito there was only flan available, and while the caramel and dulce de leche varieties we sampled were good, they were more dense than I'd expected and honestly just a bit too sweet and heavy after such a large meal. \u00a0If you do order the flan, go for the caramel, split one among three or four people, and pair it with coffee to cut the sweetness.Ultimately, \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" \u00a0Four stars, and I'd definitely come back for a night out with friends. \u00a0Next time, though, I'd wear heels. \u00a0The place is pretty posey, and besides, this ain't a yoga retreat. \u00a0Save burrito-fueled philosophizing for another day; this place is all about energy and excess.", "Date": "2010-08-25", "Author_Location": "Ann Arbor, MI"}, {"Author": "Randy B.", "ReviewID": "6wb6RuJy83nL5zIG3ulfkw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Valets were complete @ssholes so we left", "Date": "2012-02-09", "Author_Location": "Oak Park, IL"}, {"Author": "Melissa H.", "ReviewID": "V6AJ0ILZqqmvMNAUflsKUg", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What can I say... all around horrible experience.I've given this conveniently located (within walking distance of my home) restaurant two distinct chances to wow me. \u00a0In an area with so many great restaurants and options, Mercadito falls far short of expectations.The service is rude and slow: not in a 'we are really busy, I'm sorry' way, but in a 'I really can't be bothered to stop talking to my friends and come ask for your order - even though you've been sitting there for more than 20 minutes waiting to be acknowledged' kind of way.The food, once finally ordered and served, is overpriced and only \"okay\". \u00a0In short, I would not recommend this restaurant.

I can't say I was disappointed, but all in all the experience at Mercadito resulted in mixed feelings.I must give them points for the low-set tables; it made me feel like a sultan (provided that sultans eat Mexican food) and added to the overall hedonism of the experience. The first thing I noticed about the menu was the pricing, which was wayyy expensive, even for this notoriously pricey pocket of restaurants. \u00a0I had a bit of a hard time believing that someone expects me to shell out $15 for four miniscule tacos. They also had a margarita on special that was (wait for it) $17. When I finally swallowed the reality of how much I was going to pay for it, the food was of very high quality, and miraculously I did not feel fleeced when leaving. We started with two guacamoles; the restaurant offers six flavors, which I found a little gimmicky. However, the chile de \u00e1rbol guacamole was pleasantly spicy and a nice change of pace; the pepita, served with pumpkin seeds, was also very unique, but was awkwardly spiced with excessive cinammon. Of note, the sampler was $12.50 for two lilliputian scoops. All of our entrees were fantastic; our table shared a roast chicken, which I usually don't order out; this one,however, \u00a0was flavored assertively enough that it was definitely worth ordering. Delicious, and also easily the best value on this particular menu at $18.50, complete with delicious black beans and rice - if I return, this is what I will order. We also shared two \"taquizas\" (small ramekins of meat served with salsas for make your own tacos), one carne asada and another carnitas. The meats were perfectly cooked (carne asada perfect medium rare, carnitas tender and melting off the bone) and all four of our salsas (haba\u00f1ero, chile de \u00e1rbol, verde, and chipotle) were distinctly flavorful. These were a little steep for their size at $23 (Note: I actually like not being served a trough of food, I just prefer to pay a reasonable amount for it).The service, like the food, had its ups and downs. Our server and host were both very informative and attentive. However, we had to wait around 40 minutes for our food; the table next to us was seated after we had already ordered, and got their food before us. At several times throughout the meal, we had another server come to our table and attempt to give us food/drinks that we did not order, which was at least a minor nuisance.All in all, my three star review of Mercadito should not be interpreted as \"meh\", but that eating at Mercadito is like riding a roller coaster. The food was awesome enough to outweigh the exorbitant pricing and awkward service.

Then we shared the carne, al pastor and duck confit tacos. The carne was my favorite, but the al pastor and duck confit were also amazing. We all argued about which taco was the best. For dessert, we got the caramel and goat cheese flan and the chocolate cake. Now, I'm not usually one for flan, but I liked this because it was very un-flan-like. And the chocolate cake. Oh, man.

The margaritas were absolutely delicious. We ordered a tier of 3 guacamoles, the traditional, elote, and poblano; all were delicious. Even the chips were yummy! We had the pescado, carne, and carnitas tacos; AMAZING! We also ordered a burger. Yes, a burger that Daniel recommended. We weren't there to eat a burger, but with the description that he gave, we just couldn't resist. Again, AMAZING! As main dishes, we ordered a tampiquena, brochetas, and my bf had another burger (he felt it was that good), lol, and I ordered another round of carne tacos (I only ate 1 1/2, I was so full because of the appetizers). We didn't want to leave without trying a dessert. We were sharing, since we were so full. We were going to go with the tres leches cake, but Daniel suggested a dessert that has a \"bolillo\" and ice cream on it. It was a GREAT choice. It tasted like french toast.

The first time I came here was on a Saturday night at 10:30pm. I didn't eat anything since I showed up late to a dinner, but it seemed like a cool place so when a friend was visiting Chicago, I suggested we go here. I figured since it was a Tuesday night, it would be a little more chill than it was on a Saturday night. I was totally wrong. The restaurant was crazy packed and full of loud, drunk people. Made no sense to me. It's definitely very loud so we were definitely shouting at each other and I was shouting at the waiter. The restaurant is very nice inside and regardless of where you are sitting, you have a decent idea of what's going on around you so I really liked that. The food is really fantastic. The flavors are interesting and more complex than traditional Mexican food. I was a little concerned about the peanut allergy since the waiter seemed to brush it off (or maybe he just couldn't hear me because it was so loud!). Since my friend and I are both vegetarian, we ordered plates to share. I really really like that they denote on their menu what the vegetarian options are and they definitely have a lot of options. We ordered the corn masa quesadillas, the hongos tacos, the rajas tacos, the platanos machos and two salsas. My friend wasn't sure that that would be enough food, but it definitely was. I thought the best dish were the rajas tacos and my friend thought the quesadillas were the best. We both agreed that the platanos were a great mix of sweet and savory and I don't even like platanos! The plates have tiny portions (especially when you think about what you get with traditional Mexican cuisine) but I think that because there's so much oil/cheese that you really do become full. All of the dishes came out kinda at the same time and our table became pretty crowded, which I didn't like. I don't think that there's any way around that. Overall, although the food is interesting and tasty, I'm not sure that I would come back. For a Mexican food fix, I would choose a more hole in the wall place and considering how loud it is in the restaurant, it's not the best place to catch up with friends or for that matter, talk at all.

Came here for Chicago Chef's Week with a friend to dine and judge (we like to pretend we're on our own little episode of \"Check, Please\") . Food = amazing. I was talking to a co-worker about this place and describing what I ate and literally made myself salivate (not a good idea before lunch mind you). Here's the rundown for $30:You get to choose 3 of 6 guacs, we had:Traditional, Mango, CamoteChose 2 of 3 Ceviches:Camaron (shrimp)Dorado (mahi mahi)Chosee 4 of 11 types of taco - each person gets 1 taco of each:Pastor (pork)Carne (skirt steak)Estilo Baja (beer battered mahi mahi)Carnitas (pork)Side: fried plantainsGuac review: Chips were fantastic. Homemade, not greasy, great crunch. The taste of the chip did not overwhlem the guac with I think is important. The traditional was good - it's hard to make a bad guac. It was chunky, not super spicy, and had a good amount of salt. The Mango salsa kept me looking for the mangos - the chipotle was just really overwhleming. My favorite was the camote, which has sweet potato, jalapeno, and toasted pumpkin seeds. My friend and I were pretty much fighting chip-for-chip on this bad boys. Ceviche: maybe I'm not dignified enough for ceviche, so this didn't exactly rock my world. The mahi mahi one was good, but the shrimp one had too much acidity for me to enjoy. Tacos: When they first brough the plates out, my jaw dropped. The tacos were so tiny - like little baby tacos waiting to mature in big tacos. However, after biting in my first taco, I realize that the tortilla-to-filling ratio was superb. Rather than get a ton of extra bread (and carbs) they really packed in the meat and toppings so that was the main focus, not the tortilla. My least favorite was the beer-battered mahi mahi, and sadly, it was the one that I was most excited about. The fish itself didn't have a good crunch on it, but the Mexican coleslaw was actually quite tasty. The show-stealers for me were the Pastor and Carnitas - luckily we went with our waitresses recommendation and got both pork tacos instead of opting for a chicken or a chorizo one. The Pastor was a delightful combo of sweet then reach-for-your-water glass spicy. The pineapple on it was really a great touch and not something I had before. At first the Carnitas deceived me into thinking they weren't spicy, but after the taco had a chance to marinate on my tongue, it was back to the water glass. The combination of flavors and textures on both tacos was really great and I'd highly recommend them.The place itself was very trendy looking - not your typical Mexican place. While I went on a Monday night at 5pm, I could see how the seating arrangement would start to getting annoying. They have those tables that are right next to each other and I just hate that feeling of other people listening in on my conversation. The service was great, contrary to what some of the other reviews have said. Our waitress was attentive without being pushy and she made some great recommendations that probably saved us from ordering less than delicious dishes.The price is the reason that I'm only giving it 4 stars. Obviously we got a ton of food for $30, but I ordered a margarita and factoring in tax & tip it turned into a $50 meal. That's a little rich for my blood on a Monday night.

I also ordered the Mahi Mahi ceviche since I had not eaten anything for dinner and with a drink in hand that may not be such a good idea. It was out of this world! So yummy and I know the tradition is to eat it with a cracker and they had nice homemade ones but I prefer chips instead. Second visit was after the presentation with more people from the presentation and we order mango guacamole and traditional guacamole . The mango one with chili was awesome! Then we ordered the 2 different pork taco's ,chicken mole and Steak tacos. They were all so good the perfect size for sharing. I can't stop thinking of these little tacos. The con is the too much ice and margarita's and not enough booze and the bathroom doors don't lock and there was no toilet paper :P", "Date": "2010-05-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Amy K.", "ReviewID": "nTrpb5NeWae4LnllUwRJqw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My friend and I met up here on a Thursday. Thank goodness we made reservations because this place was busy. We waited at the bar until our table was ready.

Anyway, we were finally seated. To sum up our experience, the music was loud so we had difficulty hearing one another, and the seating was cramped. The food redeemed these criticisms, but we ordered WAY too much. We couldn't even eat more than a few bites of our chicken dish.

Mexican food with a flair, excellent combination of flavors, it is simply delicious. The cheviche, all pork dishes, the mahi mahi tacos the best in the city. Although busy, everything came on time and perfectly presented. \u00a0Do not expect the typical big portions of other Mexican cuisine restaurants. \u00a0Which is perfect as you get to enjoy different flavors without getting full on minute 5 of dinner.However....

We rushed out of work, arrived right at 7.30, hair still wet, laces undone, threw our keys to the valet, run in so we do not miss our table, as she warned me over the phone. Same hostess, no smile, asked us to sit at the bar because our table will not be ready until 8.00! After I strongly pointed out the details of our phone conversation, the main host came over again and sat us right away!! Wow, something just opened up? I guess we did not need to spend $100 on Margaritas before our \"table is ready\". Watch out when you order the carnitas. There are 2 items on the menu with the same name so there is 50/50 chance to get the wrong dish. \u00a0If they send you the wrong one, they make sure you get a dirty look and a lecture from the waiter as if you are supposed to know that...

Their brunch cocktails are great, and its fun to come with friends for their brunch bottle service. you can get vodka with multiple bloody mary mixers and garnishes or champagne with fruit purees and fruit garnishes. They are all really good and fun to make! My favorite cocktail here though is the pepino el pyu which is cucumber and tequila and spices. You can't even taste the tequila and its the perfect mixture! I tried another drink recently that was kind of spicy and sweet, which had a really good balance, but the cucumber one is definitely the best!The service is usually pretty decent, not super friendly, but always prompt. I almost always get tacos and split them with people. I like how they change the menu seasonally also. I like how you can get lettuce instead of the tortilla (if i try tobe healthy) but the corn tortillas are so good its hard to resist. My favorite tacos are the estilo baja with battered fish and spicy slaw. The chicken, and chicken mole are both good, and also the shrimp and pescado. Ive had the pastor ones also, which are a little spicy for my taste but the mango really helps to balance. The guacamoles are pretty good, I like their spicy one the best, just because I am not the biggest fan of fruit in guacamole. My favorite foods I've probably had here are the sides, the brussel sprouts and cauliflower are delicious! a great accompanimient to split with people!Definitely a fun place to come with friends and to grab a drink before a night out!

It was a bit too strong for me but he seemed to enjoy it.The first time I came here was for a restaurant week special so we got to try 3 types of guacamoles, 2 ceviches, 4 types of tacos, 1 side, and dessert. This was sooo much food but I ate almost all of it because it was too good to waste!We tried the tradicional, strawberry, and toreado guacamoles. The strawberry was kind of different, I'm not sure how I feel about fruit in my guacamole but the tradicional (just traditional guac for those of you who know as little spanish as I do) was very good and the toreado, which had serrano chiles was also good.We tried the camaron and dorado ceviches. Both were very good though if there's any course I could have done without and not feel like I gained 10 lbs in one sitting it would have been this one.The tacos were really what made the meal. My husband and I kept trying each one saying \"oh my god, you have to try this\"and \"no try this!!\". Definitely weren't authentic Mexican (not that I really know what that is but I can tell you it wasn't this) but that's what made them so good. We tried the camaron (shrimp), estilo baja (battered mahi mahi), pollo (even I know this means chicken though I've been pronouncing it poh-low for years...whoops), and carne (skirt steak).

The menu items were more enhanced classics and, for the most part, I enjoyed these non-traditional flavor combinations.We started with one of their signature items: \u00a0guacamole. \u00a0Actually, they serve multiple varieties of guacamole. \u00a0 They even offer smaller portions, almost flights, so that you're able to taste a more than one. \u00a0We chose the traditional and the mango. \u00a0I preferred the traditional; fresh and creamy avocados brightened with lime juice and flavored with cilantro and jalapeno. \u00a0It was delicious. \u00a0The mango, too, was good, even if the mango wasn't a dominant flavor. \u00a0I'm pretty sure that the chips they were served with were made in house. \u00a0They were thick and crunchy and salty.We continued on with tacos, the other signature of Mercadito. \u00a0Now, this is where I got mad. \u00a0The tacos come 3 to an order, but they have to be 3 of the same one. \u00a0Again, what?! \u00a0I hate that. \u00a0Either let me buy them individually, or let me mix and match. \u00a0I don't want 3 of the same taco! \u00a0Bo-ring! \u00a0And now our server is well aware of this fact. \u00a0Sorry, hombre. \u00a0I didn't mean to jump down your throat and I know you don't make the rules, but come on! \u00a0The entire rest of the world sells tacos individually! \u00a0 Please pass along my frustration. \u00a0I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. \u00a0I would have ordered one of each, even if it was more expensive than ordering a plate of 3. \u00a0Plus, then we would have ordered ceviche, too. \u00a0Really, Mercadito could have made a lot more money off of me. \u00a0But, nooooooo....We finally settled on just TWO different tacos, after much debate. \u00a0With the help of our rolly-polly server, we opted first for the carnitas taco. \u00a0(I totally saw that one coming. \u00a0A little gordito recommending lard-fried braised pork? \u00a0How odd.) \u00a0They were served with a colorful slaw and toasted peanuts. \u00a0They were tasty in a 'fat is flavor' kind of way. \u00a0My preference of the two, though, was the carne asada. \u00a0The steak was marinated before it was grilled and managed to keep a tenderness and juiciness. \u00a0It's not often that you get a nice piece of steak made into carne asada. \u00a0Mostly you see cheap, thin cuts that end up dry and/or overcooked. \u00a0Not this one. \u00a0It still had a little blood. \u00a0It was served with some sweet, crunchy I-don't-know-what and pureed avocado. \u00a0It was very flavorful. \u00a0Because I was only allowed to choose 2 items to taste from the ENTIRE menu, that's all I get to write about. \u00a0I can't tell you about the duck taco, nor the fish or mushroom or shrimp or chicken. \u00a0Nor can I tell you about any number of the ceviches I would have ordered, nor the salsas, or tortas or anything else. \u00a0I might have also left with a different impression had we been there for dinner rather than lunch. \u00a0It just felt like much more of a dinner place to me. \u00a0I could imagine the place full of people joyfully drinking margs and snacking on tacos, laughing and mingling. \u00a0The tequilla and margarita list were pretty impressive looking, too, with a huge variety of flavors to choose from. \u00a0I'm sure that's a big draw for them. \u00a0The party's sure to be rockin' at Mercadito tonight! \u00a0Happy Cinco de Mayo!The short version (out of 10)...Food: 7.5Service: \u00a07Ambiance: \u00a06Overall impression: 7Would I go back? \u00a0Well... let's just say that I'm not running back. \u00a0I might give it a go for happy hour or a weekend brunch sometime.", "Date": "2011-05-24", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Christine R.", "ReviewID": "8K3LOTDlIjFzbAGsbHQMAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh.

I was not impressed with the food so much, but maybe because I kept comparing it to one of my favorite places on earth \"De Cero.\" \u00a0First off we got the regular guacamole which was tasty and the chips were A-OK too, then got the shrimp ceviche which was a little chewy but you can't really mess up ceviche so okay not bad, plantains had this chocolate creme on them which I just did NOT care for at all and they were COLD, the tacos that were highly recommended we try by our lip-singing waiter excited us but then quickly annoyed us when we realized we can't mix and match the 4 tacos plate. \u00a0(Like we are accustomed in doing at De Cero) So the three of us opted to only try 2 different tacos. \u00a0The shrimp which was very very spicy in this red sauce and a piece of avocado (okay I love love spicy, but this was just too overpowering and did nothing for me in terms of flavor) in fact our one friend who doesn't do spicy very well could not even eat it. \u00a0(It would have been nice if our waiter at least mentioned that fact, but then again maybe he did and we just couldn't hear him) Then there were the steak tacos. Took one bite and was disgusted. \u00a0That's all I'm going to say about that. \u00a0Oh and my friends both had to send it back because they had no idea there would be onion on them..which they can't stand (yeah everything but onion was listed on menu...weird) And that took a few minutes for our waiter to comprehend and accommodate, well probably because we were lip-singing to him! Ok so the only reason for the third star was because I would go back and would recommend it for the ambiance, the drinks (mine was pretty good but my one friend loved her pineapple tequila drink) and the DESSERT!!! Yes! Since we weren't feeling satiated by our meal we decided to order this mexican pudding cake that looked like a pancake topped with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. \u00a0Now that was heaven!! \u00a0And something I will be craving and even dreaming about!!!

Though I can rave about the drinks I can see hundreds have already beat me to it, so I'll briefly talk about the food. More specifically, the tacos are incredible. They make their tortillas in house, along with their sauces. I've tried the steak, mushroom, and mole tacos so far and every single one of them have been phenomenal; my favorite being the mole tacos. They also have 6 (maybe 8?) different guacamoles, from regular, to jabanero, to mango guacamoles that are all made in-house.

Some Yelpers have gone as far as saying this place trumps any Bayless spot. Yet others have compared it to Taco Bell! Anyway, I tried to consider those outliers and give the restaurant a fair shot. We arrived, maybe 5 minutes, but had to wait a little for our table to be prepared... no problem, straight to the bar. We ordered two classic margaritas, and they were very good (on the same level as those at Frontera). \u00a0Our table was ready before the bartender could ever finish our cocktails. \u00a0Once seated, I noticed how incredibly packed the place was. It was a Saturday night, and it was 7pm, but the increasingly large crowd reminded me off a hot spot in NYC. Now, onto the meal itself, from the appetizers to the dessert, I was shocked by Mercadito. I will also be so bold and claim it to AT LEAST as good as Frontera! We ordered a couple of the salsas and a \u00a0classic guacamole. Both were very good, but one of the salsas, I believe the medium, was outstanding. We also ordered the elote and ceviche. The elote was out of this world, and a dish I will forever crave! The ceviche was also good and was made with the freshest of fish, but I would recommend less lime and apples in the scallop ceviche. Between my girlfriend and I we had the mole taco, carne taco, and mahi taco, and they were all very good.

It's dimly lit, but it is definitely very energetic. We started off with one of their 7 guacamoles. OMG the best guacamole I have ever had in my life! So fresh tasting. It was just amazing. For dinner we both had the 4 tacos. I ordered the short rib and my bf ordered the skirt steak. We also ordered the arroz verde on the side. The only disappointment is that you couldn't mix and match the different types of tacos. You had to order 4 of the same which I do not understand.

We had the serrano and traditional guacs (serrano being my favorite), queso fundido with mushrooms (best thing we ate all night!), corn masa quesadilas (very good), mushroom tacos (also very good but not amazing), and the carnitas (I didn't try those but they were given rave reviews!). Our waiter and the water guy were ON IT. Full house and we didn't feel neglected at all. Even though the tables are packed tightly, the restaurant has a loud enough buzz that it doesn't feel invasive (unlike, say at Mia Francesca's on Clark where I get caught up in other people's convos!). All that food plus two beers and it was only $80 (not restaurant week pricing, normal pricing).

The entrees themselves came out about 10 minutes apart from each other. My sister asked for tacos which weren't spicy and she recommended the pork tacos which ended up being very spicy! She said the shrimp tacos were the spiciest on the menu and they were not spicy at all . It was a bit odd that she had said that because I've had them before even and they are not spicy at all. Our plates were cleared before we were even done and the waitress just completely forgot to bring coffee when we asked and simply said -- you don't want it still do you?? The service is bad.

I would go back for the spicy guac, and the super delicious strawberry margarita over rocks-phenomenal! Maybe a table outside for a drink and an ap over the summer would work, but I would not come back for dinner. Fish tacos (talapia) were strange in texture, can't even really describe it other then way too crispy for a saut\u00e9...hard shell with mealy internal texture...left on too long?! The steak tacos were little tiny chunks of fatty steak...not mouth pleasing. The sauces were all adequate, but all the tacos tasted \u00a0lacked for something \u00a0on the plate-we like veggies and vibrant raw things with our meat tacos to add some freshness! It is summer after all-make use of the gorgeous produce-none to be found-a very sad story indeed!
