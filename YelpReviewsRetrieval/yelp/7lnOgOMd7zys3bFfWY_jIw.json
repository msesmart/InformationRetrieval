I ended up with the club, which was pretty close - tomato, bacon, and turkey on sourdough. Not a particularly unique menu item, but probably the best one that I've ever had. \u00a0The bread was perfectly toasted and the sandwich didn't fall apart when I picked up. \u00a0It was HUGE, and I had enough for two meals.We ordered a side of latkes (potato pancakes), which you can order as a side for $3 each. A great starter / alternative to french fries, they are not too greasy and served nice and crispy, just how I like them. \u00a0They are served with a generous serving of apple sauce and sour cream.I expected the line to be much longer at 1 pm on Saturday during 4th of July Weekend, but we made it to the front of the line in about 5 minutes. You need to put your name on the hostess' list as well as stand in the line which is roped off like an amusement park ride.Oddly, they do not have turkey pastrami on their menu (most jewish delis do), but I guess they choose to focus on the \"real\" thing when it comes to pastrami. \u00a0Although not a red meat eater, I took a bite of my bf's pastrami and can say that it was very flavorful, and it, like my club, did not fall apart when picked up. \u00a0He said that it's about as good as pastrami can get.Not particularly cheap for a jewish deli on Alvarado street ($50+ after tip for 2 sandwiches and a side of latkes) but definitely something worth experiencing at least once.", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "West Hollywood, CA"}, {"Author": "Jackson Y.", "ReviewID": "lZ_tUb0FfVLxa3wdmQjlSg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok...shut up and take my money!Rye bread and coleslaw had never tasted so good until they met the pastrami at Langer's.

I came here for a late lunch (probably 2pm on a Saturday) and there was still a decent line outside, but we were seated shortly.My bf and I ordered the #44 hot pastrami with sauerkraut on rye, chilli cheese fries, and a bowl of Matzo ball soup. This was our first time ever having Matzo ball soup so I don't have anything to compare it with. However, it wasn't anything too special in my opinion so I probably wouldn't order it again -- at least not here. The pastrami did not disappoint. In fact, it was amazing. Thinking about the tender, flavorful pieces of pastrami right now makes me want a bite. The slices of pastrami were thick and not fatty. The chilli cheese fries portion was generous (I guess it had to be for $6.95) but not enough chilli in my opinion. I felt like I dipped most of my fries in ketchup. Oh well, not a big deal.It was a good thing we shared because we were stuffed by the end of our meal. My only complaint would be the pricing and parking.

The brochure showed the sandwich in all its glory along with a description of the sandwich.Surprisingly, I couldn't find the price of the sandwich even though it was advertised so boldly on the brochure. Now, I know why. It's because this sandwich was expensive, and had they shown the price along with the sandwich, a lot less people would probably order it.The sandwich itself was composed of rye bread, pastrami, coleslaw and cheese. The rye bread was hard and it's edges were so sharp that it's crust could easily pierce your lips if you weren't careful with eating it. The pastrami sandwich as a whole tasted delicious though! They say that their pastrami is high-grade but to be honest, pastrami all tastes relatively the same to me so unless you seriously screw up a pastrami sandwich, I'll enjoy it. The portions were just good enough too.Cost:I ordered the pastrami sandwich alone and nothing else. No combo, no chips/drinks/fries or w/e. The pastrami sandwich alone /w tax costed $17.50. After paying tip, I pretty much paid $20 for a pastrami sandwich.So overall: Is the pastrami sandwich good? Yes. Is the pastrami sandwich worth it's taste?

Pally ordered first and he almost dropped me like a 45 when he ordered a pastrami on a sour dough. I mean plain omelets at Nate n Als are one thing but white bread should never touch a piece of pastrami. Moses must have caused an earthquake somewhere. I blame myself for that one, as while a good dad, I blew it when it came to the course of deli etiquette. I ordered the derma, matzo ball soup and a plate of pickles. So, the orders came quick and it didn't knock my socks off. Soup was fair, derma was ok but must of been from a recipe I am not familiar with, I had about 1/4 of the pastrami sandwich and to me it tasted too corned beefy and didn't quite make it, the pickles were decent and the rye bread was truly perfect.

We wanted to get some lunch and let my yelp bookmarks lead us here.When we first got there, there was quite a line (we arrived today after 2 pm). So we decided to just order to go (no need to wait in line outside of the restaurant for that). We got the famous #19 (pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw, Russian dressing all on \u00a0rye bread... but of course you could always ask to top it on another type of bread if you want) to share. I had originally wanted to purchase a large Matzah Ball Soup, but we were told that they only sell one size to go (1 quart), which is placed in a glass mason jar and cost $10.95 (prior to tax). That is just too much soup for us and the sandwich we ordered was already pretty expensive, so I decided not to order it after all. Anyways, we waited a little less than 10 minutes after we ordered our sandwich. Then we were on our way back to our car (by the way, parking is off of 7th & Alvarado... 1 block behind the restaurant.. free parking with validation) and just decided to eat this at the next location on our L.A. outing. Anyways, when we finally got our hands on the sandwich, we both were in agreement that the sandwich was delicious. I wouldn't say this is the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had though, but it was good. The Russian dressing and cole slaw were good to give added crunch and flavor to the sandwich. But this sandwich was a little messy for both of us. But it was a nice touch to find a towelette and a mint in our to go bag. We also had a small plastic bag with 3 pickle halves, but since we didn't have scissors on us, we both were not able to try it with the sandwich. The pastrami meat itself was quite juicy. Overall, this sandwich was pretty good!So with a great dining experience, why am I only awarding Langer's 3.5 stars you ask? Well the price for this sandwich is MUCH higher than any other Jewish Deli style restaurant that I have ever gone to and although I thought this sandwich was a winner, I don't think I would come back because of that high price. Also the lady who took our order wasn't really that friendly and I wished there was a smaller to go option for the Matzah Ball Soup. So until Langer's lowers their prices, I sadly won't be coming back (unless someone really awesome would like to invite me and pay for my next meal).", "Date": "2013-08-17", "Author_Location": "Duarte, CA"}, {"Author": "Marc G.", "ReviewID": "uMBFozcbmZja9mkoNOb0-g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For as long as I have been in LA, it still amazes/saddens/confuses me that I have never been to Langer's... until today.Yes, the area sucks. \u00a0it really is a shame. \u00a0Yes, the place looks like it was caught in a time warp, which I actually love. \u00a0And yes, the pastrami is superb.Is it the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had... and this comes from an NYC born, NJ raised nice Jewish fella who has seen his share of East Coast Delis and Diners...

No wonder you Yelpers rate this place so well.All the rumors that you heard about their famous combination #19 is the absolute truth, right down to the very last bite. They bake their own rye bread to smother the pastrami, swiss cheese, and cole slaw. The pastrami is tender, yet sliced thick and wholesome. Just the right amount of flavor and spice, not too fat and not too lean. Even, the cole slaw blends nicely into the sandwich, giving you that missing crunchy texture. I had to think twice to realize that maybe this is what a real pastrami sandwich is supposed to taste like. Can we get an extra pickle over here?The restaurant is real cozy, right down to the classy 70's d\u00e9cor.

They do their jobs well, with extra attention and care given to each customer. I understand why their loyal fan base continues to wait in line during rush hour. The area is busy (next to MacArthur Park), but the parking makes sense, as they give you validation for 90 minutes if you park on their lot, which is one block East of 7th and Alvarado.I ordered the Chili Cheese Fries and that was sensational. Their chili tasted better than any chili I've had in a while. A bit salty, but mixed with the melted cheese and crispy fries, it's really something to talk about.

Okay, so maybe I'm kind of stingy on stars but I really feel like Langer's was pretty darn good but it's more of a 4 star experience.They have you wait outside on the sidewalk in a makeshift line. After seeing the inside, I can see why they do this. They simply don't have the space for you to hang around and wait. The interior of Langer's looks like it hasn't been changed since day one. It looks like an old style deli. They even have glass cases with cakes inside.The waitress was really nice and pretty attentive. You have to walk up to the counter to pay though and I didn't feel like they were all that friendly at the counter. The restaurant is really quiet inside even though it was full. I felt oddly like I was in a library or in a patient waiting room and had to watch my voice level. Even the kids were all quiet.The menu can be confusing because it's pretty much 3 pages of jam packed list of the dishes they offer. The texts are small and there several text boxes. Don't worry. Skip through all the BS and just order #19. I'm sure some other stuff on the menu is pretty good too but who gives a crap. We all know everyone comes for #19.So what is this #19? It's their thick cut pastrami sandwich on rye with Russian dressing and coleslaw. Let me warn you that their plain pastrami sandwich is about $13 and the #19 will cost you a pretty penny at $15.30 before tax and tip. Is it worth it? Sure. I just wouldn't make this my primary food group or I would be broke pretty fast.The thick cut pastrami did live up to the hype. It is very unique indeed. The taste and texture of the sandwich is vastly different from that of the typical pastrami sandwich. The meat has a soft yet substantial texture and it has a deeper flavor than the thin slices of pastrami.. The pastrami itself is on the sweeter side. I felt like my sandwich could use a little more saltiness in its combination of flavor but that's nothing a lot of mustard can't fix.They provide you with both dijon and yellow mustard in a squeeze bottle tableside. I find that the most effective way to maximize your mustard input is to use both kind and squeeze them onto your sandwich in large quantity before each bite.I tried their chili cheese fries but it was nothing to write home about.

Like Taylor's Steakhouse, Langer's is a restaurant with high prices in a fairly unexpected location. Also like Taylor's, Langer's is terrific.I walked in around 2:00 PM on a hot day to find the beautiful relief of AC. The dining area was refreshingly cool without being too cold to handle. After awkwardly standing around for a moment, not knowing if I should seat myself, one of the servers offered me a seat at their counter.I perused the menu briefly and considered the corned beef before settling on the famous number 19: pastrami, Swiss, and slaw with a Russian style dressing. I wanted home fries, but the $3.95 tag made me settle on a small order of fries.The Number 19 was perfection on a plate. Everything about the sandwich was superbly executed. I used to think rye was disgustingly dry and heavy, but this rye featured a soft, light middle and a crispy crust. The pastrami was flavorful and moist, with thick fresh cuts stacked high. I found an entire sandwich almost too much to finish, so make sure to cut one of your halves into fourths.The fries were your fairly run of the mill crinkle-cut fries. They came out hot and fried to perfection. As much as I enjoyed them, I couldn't help but feel that these were far too ordinary for the price tag. I absolutely love the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. Langer's manages to have the charm of an old-fashioned American diner. The servers are as friendly as the ones in this idyllic fantasy. Fortunately, the restaurant is very well-maintained and clean.The only negative things about the restaurant are the prices. $2.50 is too much for the fries, especially considering the fact that they weren't special. $2.95 for a fountain drink is excessive, and $2.75 for a can of soda is robbery. I have fewer issues with $15.20 for the sandwich, but all these prices just don't quite fit, given the atmosphere of the restaurant.4.75 stars - yeah, the prices could and probably should be a little lower. That doesn't change the fact that it's an incredible pastrami sandwich. As a result, I didn't feel robbed or cheated after I finished. The best ever? Who knows.

It is a very close margin nonetheless.I enjoyed the #19 sandwich (Pastrami, coleslaw, Russian dressing, swiss cheese, not melted).It was good but I didn't think it measured up to a straight pastrami sandwich.The elements were well thought out, but it was more difficult to savor the subtleties of the excellent pastrami.Its a great sandwich if you want to chow down fast without thinking about the food.I could barely notice the thin slice of cheese.Value is good, and prices are affordable.It cost around $40 for a lunch for two, including two sandwiches, a chili cheese fries, and a regular coffee.I came here hungry and left entirely satisfied. Ordering the pastrami by the pound and taking it home might present an even more attractive value.Service is about average, ambiance is pretty depressing, but I don't think that's relevant here.Location and opening are the main cons of Langers.It's just not in the best of neighborhoods unless you're close to the 101, and they close at 4pm.Thankfully, there was no line to get in.Long review will get more into each dish.***Long Review-Hot Pastrami, $13.50 (Dish Rating, 90%)I came here with a friend of mine who is a chef. \u00a0We were both impressed with the pastrami sandwich here and felt it worked best. \u00a0I think the best possible experience from Langer's comes from savoring the pastrami itself with minimal condiments. \u00a0It has a complexity that gets obscured if you add on too much other stuff. \u00a0The rye bread works, because the starch compliments the meat without taking away much. \u00a0Perhaps a good drink pairing could enhance the pastrami as well, but I haven't explored that yet.Comparing Langers and Katz pastrami was difficult. \u00a0Both offered such first class products, where I think I had to nitpick down to some of the smaller details to decide which I enjoyed more. \u00a0Both had a good spice presence. \u00a0It just happened to be that Katz version was a bit more complex and intense. \u00a0Both pastrami were effective in that they weren't too salty, often a pitfall on many lesser pastrami. \u00a0It did not seem either Pastrami were particularly peppery. \u00a0Fat content of the pastrami was a notable point of interest. \u00a0Langers did have a higher amount of fat than Katz, and it seemed more evenly dispersed on the meat. \u00a0Neither versions had too much or not quite enough fat. \u00a0However the flavor of fat is not exactly similar to the flavor of spice, so it's up to one's preferences. \u00a0I did find Langers to be a bit more greasy, but the effect isn't excessive or unpleasant.Texture of the pastrami was also pretty close. \u00a0Both versions were notably tender. \u00a0What I did notice was that at Langers, the meat was often cut inconsistently. \u00a0Some slices would be nicely thick and a joy to chew through. \u00a0Other slices would be too thin for my liking. \u00a0At Katz, the slices would be more uniformly thick. \u00a0Each bite worked better texture wise when chewing through the meat.The rye bread from Langers was a high note. \u00a0The slices of rye seemed toasted, and more intense flavor wise from the rye seeds. \u00a0Nonetheless, the flavor of the rye seems to compliment, rather than distract from the pastrami. \u00a0It's nice to have some starch with the meat.Value is more or less the same with both sandwiches. \u00a0I don't recall the exact price of Langer's Pastrami sandwich. \u00a0It might have been $13 or $14. \u00a0The #19 is closer to $16. \u00a0Katz is around $15.95 before tax. \u00a0Portion size is comparable. \u00a0Langer's might offer a bigger portion, but I didn't measure either and can't say for sure. \u00a0The difference in value is negligible for me.", "Date": "2013-02-14", "Author_Location": "Beverly Hills, CA"}, {"Author": "Harry Z.", "ReviewID": "Tzien-HMY81DzYlsQgefvQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the #10- Pastrami w/ Russian dressing and swiss cheese. \u00a0All in all a good solid pastrami sandwich - however Brent's deli is better. \u00a0The swiss cheese was not melted onto the sandwich - and it should have been. \u00a0The potato pancakes were quite good - but not as good as Nate N' Al's. \u00a0The service was terrific, as was the atmosphere - true old school Jewish deli feel.", "Date": "2014-01-05", "Author_Location": "Marina del Rey, CA"}, {"Author": "Paul R.", "ReviewID": "qMTchvYGANywAK6VsSLkeg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here's a riddle: How many Jews does it take t walk in a deli and order just 2 sandwiches?

More than $30 later, we walked to MacArthur park to divide our Langer's trove. Six of us opted to sit on the grass. I was the stand out, more hesitant than the rest, thinking if the homeless are going to bring their own cardboard, something must be wrong at that elevation. I'll remain stand, thank you very much.I enjoyed my 2 bites with great satisfaction but felt cheated not having more. Seriously, I didn't get to taste enough to give it 5 stars and the neighborhood was slightly questionable. The pickles were sealed in some vacuum-packed baggies which had to be opened with a pocket knife. We can all thank the rabbi for reminding us to carry our own switch blades and not borrowing from the park residents.A little history for you that I heard, not sure if it's true: If it wasn't for the underground train in the area, Langer's would have closed years ago. So here is my tip for you deli fans visiting Langer's: Dine inside or bring some extra cardboard for your outdoor tableware.", "Date": "2013-07-10", "Author_Location": "Thousand Oaks, CA"}, {"Author": "R.W.

I ended up picking the #1 and it was #1!The rye bread balanced perfectly with the pastrami and cole slaw packed in the middle. Oh and don't get me started on their pickles! Being from Utah and not having access to the freshest fruits and vegetables all the time, I'd like to add that their pickles are the best pickles I've ever had. There was a sweetness about them and a hint of cucumber in each bite. Pickle heaven. In retrospect, the food was pricey, but it filled me up and really everything was pricey on my vacation. We also ate at Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen and got meh food for 3x the priceyness.If I lived in the area, I'd stop by at least weekly going through the menu line by line and then head on over to Scoops for some ice cream :)The cost of the food drops my rating to 4 stars...but the taste of the food put's it at 4.9 stars...and that damn pickle (so good!) places it at a solid 5.

They have a lot a block down for customers but it was $5 for 20 minutes.... um NO. I was going to get a to-go order anyway and wasn't about to fork out that much cash. Most of the street parking was unavailable because of street cleaning, and I saw a lot of cars with tickets so that made me nervous.

I wouldn't recommend going at night, I was there around 12:30 so it was cool but yeah it could get sketchy in the evening. It's a predominately Hispanic area so it's not scary you just need to be aware of your surroundings. This one guy tried to hand me a paper but I politely declined in Spanish and that was that.

But I'm here to spread the gospel on the #44, my all time favorite sandwich!Located in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles, Langer's is a super popular deli that's been serving Angelinos amazing sandwiches for over 65 years. The menu here is quite large, with tons of sandwiches, salads, sides, breakfast fare and more. As I stated above, everyone loves their #19, including me. What's not to love?Housemade Rye, pastrami, coleslaw, Swiss and Russian dressing make this a fantastic, must try sandwich.But the #44 owns my heart. Grilled Rye, Nippy cheese, sauerkraut and tons of Langer's phenomenal pastrami make this massive Sammie a masterpiece. I'm not sure if it's the wonderful grilled rye, the tasty Nippy cheese, the tangy kraut or the always amazing, melt in your mouth pastrami, but the #44 haunts my dreams. I crave this sandwich all the time. After my very first bite of a #44, when I had all those fabulous ingredients in my mouth at the same time, I knew I had found my all time favorite sandwich. Nothing else comes close. Nothing ever will. In fact, no matter what variation of pastrami sandwich you happen to try at Langer's (there are many), after that no other pastrami will compare. It's almost sad. After one trip to Langer's you'll never be able to fully enjoy any other pastrami sandwich.I've also had the #65, which is pastrami on rye topped with cream cheese and tomatoes. \u00a0An egg salad on sourdough that was probably the best egg salad I've ever had and a grilled Nippy cheese sandwich. I've also tackled their potato pancakes, French fries, potato salad and an amazing piece of warm apple pie topped with vanilla ice cream and Brandy sauce, all of which were fantastic. I also love both their cream soda and their egg cream beverages (both vanilla and chocolate). Service at Langer's is always top notch.

The thick-cut pastrami is great and not fatty at all. The au jus dip for my sandwich wasn't too salty, which I liked. The pastrami and cole slaw looked delicious as well. We both only finished half and they kindly bagged the other half for us. The fries were just the right amount of crisp and even the small order was enough for us.

I was craving and been wanting to eat a old school diner-style restaurant in Los Angeles. I stumbled upon this place on the reviews and wanted to give this place a try myself. It was a Friday morning at 9AM and so both of us were hungry and tired at the same time. At first, driving around, I didn't know exactly where to park. I gave the restaurant a call and they told me to park at their lot just a block east of the restaurant and it was free if i bring in the ticket for the validation. It is always nice to have free parking in Los Angeles as most of the time you have to pay for parking when eating at a restaurant in the area. We walked inside and you instantly see the old school retro look as if it was filmed in a movie or something. Quite a spacious restaurant and wasn't too packed at that time. Our waitress was quite a nice lady and was very friendly considering that it was our first time here. She recommended the #19, which was the hot pastrami with cole slaw, swiss cheese, Russian Rye dressing on Rye bread for $15.20. I thought at first it seemed a bit much for sandwiches but sometimes the tastes is what I care most. My friend and I ordered on her recommendation and seems like the item that everyone ordered most at this restaurant. It didn't take too long for them to make so we got our sandwiches within less than 10 minutes. It smelled really good and I was very hungry to eat. I took my bite into the sandwich and it was quite tasty. Very rare to find pastrami tasting this good. It tasted just like the sandwich at Kat's Deli in New York City in a strange comparison. The bread was really crunchy and the dressing wasn't too heavy. I instantly felt really full after finishing the sandwich. They cut the sandwich in two making you think it is small but it is quite a good amount. Overall, this place is a good choice when you want to try good pastrami sandwich and like the old school diner feel which I also like. It felt like you went back in time when everything and food was a bit more honest. The service was really good and friendly waitresses really helped. I would come here again for great pastrami sandwiches. I probably want to try the potato pancakes that are famous here as well.

Definitely not \"the best pastrami in the world.\"Went here with the wifey after taking care of some business downtown. I love me some real pastrami sandwiches; none of that thinly sliced sandwich meat stuff! Ordered the #19 and my wife ordered the half soup/sandwich combo with matzo ball soup and a corned beef sandwich.Pastrami sandwich - had good flavor. Crunch on the bread was nice, but it was a little overly crunchy when as you're eating it. Lots of rye bread flavor though, so that was nice. I do think there's a little too much cole slaw. I suspect its mostly there as filling, because many famous pastrami places pile on a huge amount of meat. It didn't need it though. I would've been happy with less slaw & still the same amount of meat they gave. The blandness inherent in cole slaw kinda threw off the balance of the sandwich for me. It muted some of the pastrami flavor, which was actually very good on its own.Corned beef sandwich - I actually liked this one more than the pastrami, because it tasted better in its simplicity. Corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese. Very good stuff done right. What else is there to say?Matzo ball soup - a good simple soup. Again, good, not great. And definitely not the among the best I ever had. But on a chilly morning, it did its job. Only critique was that the matzo was a little mushy for my taste, but some people like it that way, as opposed to a little more dense.Staff was very friendly and helpful. So my wife actually ordered a half soup, half sandwich, and for a $1 we upgraded to a whole bowl of soup. The food came out and \u00a0it was actually a whole bowl and a whole sandwich. Someone had made an error, but we said we didn't mind. However, they said that since they made the mistake, they wouldn't charge us for it, so we paid the regular price for the combo. Very nice of them.My biggest gripe, since I'm Asian haha, would have to be the price. C'mon, one pastrami, half a corned beef sandwich, a soup, and nothing to drink but water & it was still over $32.

There have been countless other times I have organized large groups of people to dine at Langers. \u00a0 I loved their pastrami. \u00a0I loved their rye bread. \u00a0I loved sharing it with other people. \u00a0For my brother's birthday, I wanted to send him some of Langer's Pastrami and rye bread across the country via Fed-Ex overnight. \u00a0That's now highly I thought of Langer's. \u00a0It's a damn shame they didn't think that highly of me.I ordered two pounds of Pastrami and a Rye bread. \u00a0The woman that took my order didn't know the cost of the shipping. \u00a0Now they do this all the time, they have a page on their website dedicated to Langer's Overnight By Air with a photo of a Fed-Ex airplane on it. \u00a0This isn't the first time I've done something like this. \u00a0I've ordered pastrami from the Carnegie Deli and the Stage Deli in New York and had it Fed-Ex overnighted across the country before. \u00a0It's usually about $35 to $40 for shipping. \u00a0I had called Carnegie before Langers and was quoted $46. \u00a0So when she didn't know the price, I thought I did and wasn't too concerned. \u00a0Everything was charged to my credit card over the phone.The next day I got a receipt in the mail saying shipping was $71. \u00a0 $71 to ship 2lb of pastrami and a loaf of rye bread? \u00a0$71 to ship $49 worth of food. \u00a0Who would pay that? \u00a0When you find out it's that much, don't you call someone back and say - \"Hey you are about to walk off a cliff?\" \u00a0They did call back, but only to get a phone number of the person they were to deliver to. \u00a0No mention of the shipping and handling price. \u00a0So does not agreeing on a shipping price at the exact moment you give someone your credit card info give them the right to just charge whatever they want? \u00a0Why stop there, charge $500 for shipping maybe. \u00a0Hey I gave you my credit card number, enjoy.So, I call back the next day and ask for the manager and get Norm Langer's daughter Trisha. \u00a0I tell her my story and how I felt blindsided with the delivery fee. \u00a0She agrees to talk to her father and get back to me. \u00a0The next day, she tells me that's what Fed-Ex charges and since I didn't specifically ask for the delivery charge, there is nothing we can do about it. \u00a0Now I put myself in her shoes and here's how I would look at it. \u00a0Here's a guy who loves our product so much that he wanted to fly it across the country. \u00a0Maybe we show him a little bit of appreciation for this problem and offer him something. \u00a0Not just tell him, sorry but tough! \u00a0I'm not looking for free stuff, but in the restaurant world that's how these things are handled. \u00a0Did I suddenly expect them to write me a check for $71. \u00a0No. \u00a0But would a sorry this happened, here's a $25 gift certificate been too hard. \u00a0Or hey come ask for me next time you are in and I'll hook you up with a sandwich. \u00a0Heck a slice of cheesecake? \u00a0As I started stewing about this, I called them back again and told her how she handled this wrong and should treat their customer's with respect. \u00a0Her response, \"We are in business and can't go giving a free handout to every customer that has a little problem.\" \u00a0A free handout? \u00a0I just spent $49 on pastrami and a rye bread. \u00a0I know she doesn't know but I've spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars in their establishment since I moved here 10 years ago. \u00a0For that I get a condescending \"lesson\" on caveat emptor.It's clear what we had here was two angry jews on each end of the phone, and that's a bad combination for negotiation and the whole reason that lawyers were invented. \u00a0She blamed me for not demanding that they give me the shipping price. \u00a0I blamed her for not trying to make this right. \u00a0The more I argued my point, the more annoyed she got with me and it was clear that by this 3rd call, she wouldn't give me a free poppy seed that fell on the floor out of the coleslaw just on principle. And now I'm so mad, I've called my credit card company and disputed the charge, which I'll most likely win, since I never signed a receipt stating what the amount was before it was charged. \u00a0They could have just been nice, but now they'll most likely have to eat that whole $71. \u00a0Good job Langer's. \u00a0Way to treat your loyal customers.Also of note, for their $71, they didn't even bother to put a cold pack in the shipping container. \u00a0It was just vacuumed packed and sent at room temperature for 24 hours. \u00a0You can debate whether that's safe or not, curing the pastrami does help kill bacteria, but since every other place I've ordered from put a cold pack with it, maybe you should too. \u00a0If you aren't worried about keeping it cold, then why bother overnighting it in the first place.", "Date": "2012-06-29", "Author_Location": "Fullerton, CA"}, {"Author": "Michael S.", "ReviewID": "8Y_H9EY5pvCuIrcGypbwVQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Langer's is legendary for a reason.

The soft and flavorful tongue was a great match for the French Bread Roll ($14.50 + $0.75 for the roll). I'd definitely get this again and would add some extra toppings like the slaw and a cheese.

I never had use for Russian dressing and have rarely been inspired by cole slaw, until now.

Sooner or later, we might even start seeing commercials on TV. @ work, hunger is setting in for lunch, and all I hear is Langers and how great their hot pastrami sandwiches are. Its been a while since my last #19. Approximately a year and 5 months. Why I have such a distinct memory of how long its been is due to my awful (5 star) review I had once given Langers (yelp newb) at the time so I had deleted the old review to write a new one. Waiting to get out early from work @2pm felt like a eternity and the traffic on the way to Langers from West LA was nevertheless horrible! It could not stop this man from getting what he wanted. Till this day, I still do not know where the hell this damn parking lot Langers supposedly owns is. I parked in the first parking meter I saw close by and did not give a damn about paying for the parking either. I lied, I actually did care, as I tried putting in a single quarter only to get a FAIL reading, so I was like FUCK IT! I left my car as is, with the parking meter flashing red. I met up with Dennis C for the long awaited meal that we had talked about 2 weeks ago. Immediately we got seated and we already knew what we were getting. Each of us had a #19, pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Russian dressing on rye bread. A large fries is a must with the order! As we waited for our orders, I noticed the FBI agents disguised as undercover workers, with ear pieces hidden behind one ear as they were trying to keep the restaurant in order. Put on a suit and they could be The Secret Service. After all, Langers has a special recipe that is TOP SECRET and sure enough, this recipe needs protection from any copy cats. Our orders came out in little time and I was off to the races. Chewing like a man possessed, I got a reality check every time I chewed on the crust of the rye bread that I needed to chew, or die, choking. Before I even knew it, I was done. The resistance of ordering a 2nd sandwich was met by the price. For $14.xx, its a premium pastrami sandwich with no sides. Hang out by a freeway exit and spare $3-4 dollars of change, and you got yourself a all you can eat Korean bbq dinner! Yes, this is how I like to value things. Thats no excuse to drop my rating in my book though.

The pastrami was cooked just right: juicy, moist and tender. The rye bread was slightly toasted and buttery. The sandwich was topped with their homemade cole slaw (fresh chopped cabbage, carrots, green pepper and mayonnaise), Swiss cheese and Russian dressing.But I think the Russian dressing threw me off to the taste of the sandwich because I've never had it prepared that way before. Moreover, I am not a real fan of mayonnaise and all it is essentially is a blend of mayonnaise, ketchup, diced pickles and some mild horseradish. It's basically the same ingredients for Thousand Island dressing if you cannot imagine what the blend of flavors would taste like.There is already enough mayonnaise in the cole slaw and then you want to add more mayonnaise to the sandwich? How about no mayonnaise at all?I prefer my pastrami sandwich the traditional way, with yellow mustard, rye bread, Swiss cheese and a dill pickle.

In my opinion, the hot pastrami at Eastside Market Italian Deli is just as good and there is not this nonsense with Russian dressing.

That means two things - 1) I know good deli, and 2) I'm damn picky, and vocal about it.It is important to understand the term \"good deli.\" This term isn't merely the use of two words \"good\" and \"deli\" - it's the two together, stated firmly and in a somewhat guttural tone of voice, as if one finally had a glass of cool water after a long hike in the desert. Good deli requires three things: a large menu of fantastic Jew food, warm yet sassy servers, and noise - lots of it, provided by noisy Jewish diners gossiping about food, people and the general state of things.Having lived all over the country I've both enjoyed good deli and pined for it. But I never found it west of the Mississippi - until now.Langer's is good deli. It's the same, yet different. When I walked in it was incredibly familiar. It clearly hasn't been remodeled in forever and nobody cares. Good deli isn't about decor, in fact, outmoded decor is a plus. The menu was incredibly familiar - they have all the necessities of good deli. I suspect the people who work there have been there forever, like the deli itself. And the place was abuzz with joyous noise, punctuated from time to time by a bite and a moan.What was different than anything I've had before was the sandwich itself. I order the same thing whenever I try a new deli: hot lean corned beef on rye, plain. Yeah, you read that right - plain. I don't need any mustard overpowering the flavor of that delicious corned beef. If the sandwich is good it won't be dry. The meat will be moist enough to carry it.So the sandwiches come out (my wonderful husband Jim W got the famed #19 which he waxed on about in his review ) on what appears to be a slightly coarser rye - thicker crust, thicker slices - and the meat itself isn't shaved. It's thick, that's right I said thick. I've eaten at over 100 delis and I've never seen that anywhere. But it was fantastic!!! In fact, Jim's #19 was the best pastrami I've ever tasted. We moaned through the entire meal. We split a delicious order of hash brown w/onions as accompaniment and I took half my sandwich home (also a good sign - Jews are feeders. If they don't feed you enough to have too much they've shamed their ancestors).Though I'm surely not the first - or even the hundredth - I officially pronounce this deli east coast Jew approved.Thanks to fellow yelpers Al S and Lon H (my cousin) for the recommendation.

And low and behold.... LANGER'S DELI in Los Angeles!So, on a Friday morning right before the rush of lunch hour, I headed to LA to try what many Yelpers and the like say is the best pastrami in town! Upon entering, it was clear to see Langer's had full of history just by the interior decor, etc. At the front of the door was a rather large sign that stated, \"Our most popular sandwich: #19\", so of course I ordered the #19 and also a regular ole' pastrami sandwich \"plain\" so that I could compare the quality of the pastrami with Katz. My first bite... disappointing. The rye bread had a nice outer crunch but I found it hard to eat because it was so... overly crunchy, I'd say. Nevertheless, the meat... UGH! It was quite fatty and I read on the menu that for a lean cut, it cost an extra $3... totaling out to a $17+ pastrami sandwich!! Umm.. no thank you, how about you give me a nice thick lean cut in general! I don't mind fatty because I know it makes a sandwich more juicy, etc, etc... but this cut was quite fatty and by the first bite, my taste buds gave up. #19 ($14+)The russian cole slaw was decent... but I felt like it overpowered the taste of the pastrami sandwich overall. It tasted nothing special from other cole slaws I've had. Plain Pastrami ($12+)This plain pastrami sandwich was the true test of the pastrami itself and it FAILED. I was very disappointed because the cuts were not that thick and the quality of the meat was lacking in my opinion... in comparison to Katz of course.CONCLUSION:Now, I understand it's not fair to compare the best of LA to the best of NYC... but it was hard not to because after hearing and reading the amazingness of Langer's, I had similar high expectations. However, I will say that Langer's is the best pastrami sandwich I've eaten in LA... but not the best ever. If you've been to Katz in NYC, you'll know what I am talking about... but if you haven't, I encourage you to try if you happen to be in the city. Besides that, if you're a sucker in LA...

Steak and eggs. Cream cheese and lox. \u00a0But who comes here for that? \u00a0It's all about the pastrami. \u00a0Crudely carved, moist, tender, flavorful pastrami. \u00a0Even if you order only a pastrami sandwich and nothin' else, bill will come to around $15. \u00a0FIFTEEN DOLLARS??? For a sandwich??? Well, consider that it's monstrous. \u00a0You're really getting 2 sandwiches here. \u00a0It comes to you, cut in half. \u00a0One half of a pastrami sandwich here dwarfs a whole sandwich most anywhere else. \u00a0I know sandwich #19 with pastrami, coleslaw, and Russian dressing gets a lot of love. \u00a0But for me, #54 with pastrami and CORNED BEEF is what gets the job done. \u00a0If you come for a table, really expect a wait. \u00a0It's truly, utterly popular here. \u00a0And bring $25 at least. \u00a0In case you want a drink, like a chocolate malt too. \u00a0Sometimes you just crave calories. \u00a0 And I find hospitality to be pretty good and warm. \u00a0One of the ladies there always offers extra pickles when I take leftover to go.

However, we soon saw we were not alone as we walked past a string of burb'ans after they've had their pastrami fix. After studying the menu, we had to fight the impulse to order everything. So we settled on #19, pastrami sandwich served w/ cole slaw, Swiss, and Russian dressing (their most popular we noted). We also got the lox, onion and egg breakfast along w/ a short stack of potato pancake and a cup of mushroom barley soup for the boys. The pastrami doesn't need description - you just have to try it. Now, the other stuff were not as fabulous, hence the less than perfect score. The potato pancake had too much onions in the mix. So much so the boys didn't care for it. The egg dish was tad over salted and again the onions were not cooked enough so the taste was a little over powering. However, the hashbrown was cooked to perfection, browned and crispy crust with soft, tender and buttery core. The soup was a huge hit with the youngest as he nearly downed the whole bowl.

Moreover, Langer's is one of the few establishments in Los Angeles that really does live up to the hype. There is a reason why the James Beard Foundation awarded the restaurant for being a classic establishment with timeless appeal - after all it was opened in 1947. And of course, anytime a delicatessen is associated with Jewish founders, you know you can't go wrong. Jews to sandwiches are like Japanese to sushi, El Salvadorians to pupusas, Indians to slurpees, etc.Langers is located by MacArthur Park at an intersection aptly named after them, Langer's Square. Specifically, the restaurant is on the southeast corner of South Alvarado Street and West 7th Street, in an area of Los Angeles that feels more like Central America than America. In fact, many people associate this area as being a depressed part of town. However, it's not as bad as it used to be in the 1990s during the heyday of gangster rap and drive-by shootings. Actually, I remember being underage and getting by first fake ID around the corner... ah the olden days before Photoshop. Now there is a lot of traffic (both vehicular and pedestrian) in the area, and many people that want to try Langer's always use traffic and \"but there isn't any parking\" as excuses to not visit. However, there is actually a parking lot located one block east at the northeast corner of West 7th Street and South Westlake Avenue where you can park for free with a one-hour validation. And if you happen to live in the area, the Metro Red Line has a stop (Westlake / MacArthur Park Station) immediately north of the restaurant. Langer's also has something called curb-side service where you call ahead and they bring out your order to your car. However, I've never tried it because I think taking Langer's sandwiches to go is an injustice to the entire Langer's experience because you can only truly appreciate their sandwiches by dining in.From the moment you walk in you feel like you're in the diner scene from Pulp Fiction. You've got old leather booths, counter seating with stools, rustic wood furniture and waitresses that look like they've worked at Langer's since the 1960s. And the patrons consist of a diverse melting pot of people that consists of businessmen in suits to casual Laker fans in Kobe jerseys.As for the sandwiches, their most popular sandwich and one of my favorites is the #19. Langer's refers to it as the legendary #19 and I must say that it lives up to its legendary moniker. The #19 consists of cured hot pastrami sliced in thick tender slices topped off with cole slaw, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing that is perfectly held together with two slices of amazing rye bread that is double-baked. It's remarkable that despite the coleslaw and Russian dressing, the rye bread with its crispy edges and soft center somehow keeps the whole thing together. However, every time I eat the #19, it gets all over the place - especially all over my face - because it's jam-packed. Also, their Russian dressing is amazing and I always ask for an extra side of it. But here's some advice when ordering your #19. When ordering your pastrami sandwich, ask for it to be hand-cut (it just tastes better) and when asking for extra Russian dressing, simply ask for a side of \"Russian\" or else you will sound like a noob. Also, if you don't want to get too messy, ask for the coleslaw on the side. Another favorite of mine is the #44, which is pastrami, sauerkraut, and nippy (sharp) American cheese on rye. My suggestion is that if you go for the #44 order a side of cool cole slaw to help you gulp it down. The only grievance that I have with Langer's is the price. A standard pastrami sandwich will run you about $15 and a soda costs $2.95. Therefore, it's not a cheap experience. However, simply judging the food, Langer's has the best pastrami sandwiches. I guess if their sandwiches were $5 per foot or shaped like a torpedo, then they wouldn't deserve to be called legendary.", "Date": "2010-10-23", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Stephanie T.", "ReviewID": "sizTiOAh3BxyBm8WTnT2ng", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After seeing this place featured on the Food Network and curious to see the west coast version of a pastrami specialist, we decided to give this landmark a try.

After each bite, the mixture of your thick cut Pastrami, bread, slaw, light funk from the cheese, and the sweet kiss of the Russian dressing almost always makes me tear. When I'm done finishing her off, my tummy may be full and happy, but my mouth yearns for another. Maybe it is a good thing I didn't meet you sooner. I'd probably weight a ton by now. Even for about ~$13 for your sandwich, I'd never abandon you. Please don't ever leave me. Love - Wes** Update - 2/12/08 P.S.

I just get so worked up over deli !Last Tuesday I took one of my best buds', who is also a client, along with me to L.A. for business and \"lunch.\" We ended up at Langer's around 1230p. After watching that \"Best thing I ever ate\" on Food Network, I saw the segment on Langer's #19. We ordered the #54 Pastrami and Corned Beef combo, but ultimately with the same fixin's as the #19. (see my photo) We also ordered a side of the potato salad, and finished up with a slice of the chocolate cake and a slice of the NY Cheesecake. With drinks, the bill came to $55. ($25 per person is, for us, a fair deli lunch bill.)What did we think? Unlike most thin-cut meat sandwiches, this pastrami was cut thicker home-style. But that was good. It was exceptionally moist, with enough fat to carry the pickled meat flavor from sandwich to tongue. And if you don't think bread makes a difference...... think again. Their rye makes their sandwich. Was it piled super high? No.... and thank goodness for that, because the bread was baked and cut in an elongated shape, and there was more surface area to evenly spread the meat and slaw. Overall thickness, before hand compression, was maybe 3 inches. That's very important to me, because then, you can get all the ingredients in each and every bite. Bottom line, you won't be disappointed with the #19 regular, or the \"hyped up #54 version.\"The potato salad was \"different\", but OK. It's a fine-diced potato base. It wasn't overly \"mayo-creamy\", which for me, detracts from the taste. We kept looking at each other, as we worked our way to finishing it off, asking, \"What did they put into this, and exactly how they prepared it? What about the desserts? Here's the glitch..... I bake cheesecake, and as a plain cheesecake, theirs gets a \"C-.\" And for a deli cheesecake, it was also an incredibly small slice/serving? The chocolate cake? Same low grade, but bigger serving. However, it was nothing special. I'm pretty certain they buy in the cakes. I'm hopeing to get ahold of Norm Langer and share our opinion. I'm sure Langer's might agree that If you're gonna' serve only one chocolate cake, make it a \"Death by Chocolate\" or something equally memorable. And if you're a deli, you just gotta serve a healthy slice of a NY lemon cheesecake, maybe with a nice sourcream top. Dessert is the last thing we eat...... and many times the first thing we talk about! It's gotta' be great, and for Langer's, it should be equal to their memorable pastrami.", "Date": "2009-08-12", "Author_Location": "Laguna Niguel, CA"}, {"Author": "Andrew F.", "ReviewID": "NGN3y2ZNqe0ScOLVpVe9Dg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THE BLURB: Finally! I have reached the holy grail! Or so I thought when I finally visited Langer's for the first time - and most likely the last.THE SETTING: I got there at 3:30pm on a Saturday, 30 minutes before they close - and it was PACKED! Had to wait for 5~10 minutes, but it wasn't that bad. Something that surprised me was how clean and organized the place seemed, although there was some funky cleaning agent smell that I kept breathing in - ughck.SERVICE: The lady sat us down quickly, and you could tell she wanted to serve us quickly, take our order quickly, and get us the heck out quickly.THE HIT LIST: My lovely company, aka my mother, and I split the #19 Pastrami (aka the reason I went to Langer's) and the #88 Reuben with Corned Beef.#19: The combination of the bread and the slaw was near heavenly. There was a subtle sweetness about the bread that seemed to accentuate the flavors and greatness in the slaw - then comes the pastrami. Ohh, how fatty you were, but how even more jammed-packed with taste you were. The textures worked well together, although the overall substance was a bit overwhelming.#88: Dare I say this? I liked the Reuben better than the #19. Yes.. zOMG! Andrew! What are you thinking?! Yes.. the grilled rye on the Reuben trounces the #19 rye. The mound of corned beef that laid foundation for the mountain of sauerkraut in #88 proved to be more appetizing and lovely than the #19. The textures, the juiciness, the flavor, EVERYTHING about the #88 seemed better than the #19. Yes, #19 had it's sweetness and variety of textures and flavors, but both my company and I agreed - #88 stood the victor.THE DAMAGE: 2 sandwiches, a coke, tax and tip = $40.00 (aka - the reason it will be my last time at Langer's)THE VERDICT: Sure - this place is great. A bit over-hyped, but the sandwiches were huge. But I highly doubt I will be back. It's very pricey for my taste and being in the part of town that it is makes for good reason to lessen my chances of returning to Langer's. Okay okay, please don't stone me - but strangely enough, I think I might still like pastrami from the likes of The Hat or Lucky Boy over thick sliced pastrami - it's just something I'm raised on. Yes yes - what am I thinking?! I know.. but hey, it's my opinion and you have yours.Also, Langer's is farther than I'd like to drive - I have Pasadena Sandwich Company closer to home that serves sandwiches about the same size, 80% of the quality, and is half the price. Yes, again, please don't stone me for my opinions. Overall, it was a fun experience. I came, I saw, I ate, and I cried. Cried because it was so tasty. Cried because it was $40 for two sandwiches.BONUS: There's a Mexican lady 1/2 a block down from Langer's selling Dirty Dogs.

Meh...it's just OK.I pulled up to a bar stool and sat at the counter. I was so eager to have some yummy pastrami! It would have been oh so cliche for me to order the #19, so I opted for the #44: Hot Pastrami, Sauerkraut and Nippy Cheese Grilled on Rye. I refrained from ordering the #19 because I prefer having my slaw on the side, rather than on the sammie. I've had some bad slaw in the past and I did not want my pastrami sandwich mingled with slaw. I also ordered a cream soda and small order of fries.#44 Hot Pastrami Sandwich: 2.75/5Normally, memory conjures the thought of a pastrami sandwiches stacked tall. Langer's sammies are not stacked tall, but they are wider. I was far from elated when I bit into this sammie. First, the pastrami lacked a distinct pastrami flavor. It tasted more like corned beef...but bland! Second, there was slightly more sauerkraut than pastrami! Third, the pastrami was not as lean as I prefer. I did love the gently toasted rye bread which provided a great contrast in texture. Furthermore, their sauerkraut was ideal. Eating this sammie almost became chore. I think I was a bit disappointed because it tasted so much like a corned beef sandwich. Don't misunderstand me, I love me some corned beef, but when I want pastrami, it better taste like pastrami!Fries: 3.5/5YAY!!! Crinkle cut fries! Makes me think of Ore-Ida Frozen French Fries from my childhood! The serving was inconsistent: Some fries more deep fried than others. They were nice and warm!My intention was to go to Nate & Al's in Beverly Hills later in the day, but it didn't pan out that way. Nate & Al's pastrami is better.

The crust had a crunch to it that gave the sandwich a nice texture. The bread was solid and could withstand the sauce, fixings, and pastrami's attempts at breaking it apart.B.

Life is just too short.I had my mind made up that I wanted to try a Langer's #19. Nevermind that we had just recently finished a late lunch at Mozza and walked around Melrose. It was about 3:30pm and Langer's closes at 4pm. Remembering that they do curbside service, we called to order, and about 15 minutes later, we had a white paper bag delivered to our car. Just be careful not to run over anybody. No, we're not in Mexico, we're still in LA... the little voice says in your head.Back home, I'm ready to dig in. Thick slices of pastrami, swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and cole slaw sandwiched between 2 slices of rye bread. With the first bite, I definitely loved how the cole slaw contrasts with the pastrami. The rye was soft, with a thick crust, giving your teeth a chewy workout. I definitely enjoyed the sandwich, but I can nitpick a few things.The price is fairly high for the amount of pastrami in the sandwich. At the very least, it just felt like it needed a few more extra layers of pastrami. It doesn't have to be piled high (would be awesome, of course). The sandwich is just about $15 after tax, which is pretty high, in my opinion. For that amount, I want more of the good stuff, and that's the MEAT.Also, I've been fortunate to try all sorts of deli-style sandwiches in NYC, including Katz. They all just seem have more flavor in their deli cuts, and that goes for the pastrami and corned beef. Perhaps it's the seasoning or the preparation. It's hard to put into words until you actually try it for yourself. It's sort of like how pizza crust made in NYC just tastes better because of the NY water. Anyhow, I'm glad I tried Langer's. If I lived closer, and craved some sandwiches, I'd definitely come on a regular basis. There's no doubt that Langer's is trying to increase their exposure.

It may not offer the lilly-white enclave that Westsiders require to fully unclench, but it's unlikely that anything dramatic will happen to anyone with an ounce of sense.That said, I did get a ringside seat on my last Langer's pilgrimage to a homeless man raising grief at the front door and being, uhm, 'escorted' off the premises by some of the more corpulent members of the staff.

It is definitely a close one but Katz manages to create a delicious sandwich with only three ingredients (rye bread + pastrami + mustard), while I feel that the pastrami from Langers needs to be layered with coleslaw/cheese/mustard/sauerkraut/etc.Thankfully after trying Katz in NY and lusting after their pastrami, I set myself on a hunt for a deli known for their pastrami (that was comparable to Katz) and found Langer's! But... enough about Katz and comparing the two. Let's focus on what Langer's is doing right. Obviously this review isn't gonna matter all too much (960+ reviews? c'mon--it's good) but I just want to reaffirm that Langer's pastrami really is G--DOUBLE-O--D--good. \u00a0It is tender and juicy... and they actually slice it for you. \u00a0The pastrami cuts are THICK and retain so much flavor.The \"Russian style dressing\" is yummy! It tastes like Thousand Island dressing but not as creamy, and with more diced pickles and horseradish. It complements the hot pastrami sandwich well even though it was a diversion from the more coveted, traditional mustard dressing. I liked the fact that Langer's bread is crispier than the bread at Katz. It added a (nice) crunchy texture to juxtapose the tender and soft pastrami. Their coleslaw is pretty good I'd have to say. I don't even like coleslaw but it wasn't overpowering and wasn't overly creamy. \u00a0#40 (pastrami, sauerkraut, nippy cheese on rye) was a little overwhelming in taste. I usually like sauerkraut but there was too much on the pastrami that it took away from the sandwich. Also, the swiss cheese is a better substitute for the nippy cheese in my opinion. -------**My fave: #10 Pastrami, swiss cheese, and Russian style dressing. **Pricing: pretty expensive for a sandwich (~$15) but for someone like me, half a Langer's sandwich is fulfilling for one meal. I would just pack the other half to eat later on as another meal... $15 for lunch and dinner, hoorah!**Parking: metered street parking or park in the lot designated for Langer's customers.**Curb side service is awesome!

Also, it will be long.I admit, I've been selfishly yelping throughout the years- finding gems and avoiding crapstastic food served with a side of terrible customer service- \u00a0without contributing to the pool of reviews. I'm ashamed. And there may or may not be more than a few rough drafts \u00a0I've been meaning to finish in my account. As much as I enjoy getting these cutesy emails from the Yelp team reminding me to finish my reviews...[e.g., Is it our imagination, or is it getting drafty here?Just joshin' ya. But seriously, what's the scoop on *insert business name here* \u00a0we're dying to know!]it's time. And I figure, if I'm going to be the Duchess of this LA institution, then I should start here. So here we go. Full disclosure: I can only vouch for four food items on the menu.1. Matzo ball soup : good2. Fries : Ore-Ida crinkle cut, not my thing3. Latkes: \u00a0with sour cream and apple sauce. Yes, please.4. And the #19. The reason why I can only vouch for four things on the menu. Because when I'm at Langer's, I don't want anything else. The #19 is the perfect sandwich. It starts with pastrami. *The* pastrami. The kind that changes the way you think about pastrami. They take brisket, cure it in brine, then coat it with a magical blend of spices, heavy with black pepper, then smoke, and steam it. Thick cut, against the grain *by hand*. (Who does that anymore? But it's obviously worth it.) This pastrami is the the juiciest, most tender I've had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. And I've had a lot. If there's better pastrami out there, I don't want to know.Then, the pastrami is then placed on *the* bread. Double baked rye bread. Par-baked up to 80% offsite, then brought to Langer's and baked fresh in house every day. Thick crust, impossibly soft and yielding center, strewn with caraway seeds. \u00a0[tip: buy the loaf on your way out]. They say bread makes the sandwich, and I'd be inclined to say that here, except I feel like I'd be taking the shine away from the pastrami if I did. Still, I can't imagine that I would feel the same way about this sandwich with any other bread. You could stop here, but then it wouldn't be a #19, just a hot pastrami on rye. Not that there's anything wrong with that =) Maybe a bit of mustard, which are on the tables, (Gulden's of course) and you'd be good to go-the purists seem to enjoy it this way. But I wouldn't know. I could never say no to that extra crunch from the coleslaw, perfectly creamy with an acidic zip, or the Swiss cheese and Russian dressing perfectly complimenting that hot pastrami. It just works. Comes with a pickle that isn't bad, but not terribly good either. But add a cream soda on draft, and I'm in heaven. Side note: Yes, you'll probably have to wait in line during peak hours. Yes, Langer's is not in an ideal neighborhood, instead, it's across the street from MacArthur Park- but you won't be going to Langer's after the sun sets, so that shouldn't be a \u00a0problem either. Metered parking is available but only if their lot- \u00a0free with validation for an hour- \u00a0on the corner of Westlake and 7th is full. And yes, you're paying $15 for a sandwich. Absolutely worth it. So obviously, I'm a fan. Mostly because of the #19. But, for me, the cherry on top, before or after eating my sandwich, is the owner. Norm Langer, son of \u00a0Al Langer, the one who started it all in 1947.Every single time I've gone to Langer's Deli, he's there, either working side by side with his employees making sandwiches, wrapping up to go orders, or watching his employees like a hawk, a friendly hawk if there ever was one, to ensure quality.

I plan to bring that number closer to 40. Puh-straw-mee! Okay, say it like you mean it-- ***PASTRAMI***! Al Langer seeded his pastrami kingdom in 1947 and it continues to thrive \u00a0under the tutelage of his son, Norm. After a nearly deadly bout with the recession of the 90's, it thrives with dedicated patrons and a little help from the Metro Red Line adding a stop there.There's more than just pastrami, of course. For instance, I've never had a corned beef reuben until Langer's and it was archetypal. If you want to venture out of sandwichville, you can try their braised lamb shank with homemade stuffing for $15.50. If you're an alpha-carnivore, you can brave the trifecta of meats: turkey, tongue, roast beef for $14.95. However most of the sandwiches are around $10-$12. Expensive but each is a tower of power, built like an edible brick, and often \"reubenized\" with Russian style dressing that can easily be dressed up with sauerkraut and most often accompanied with cole slaw. The French Dip is tres magnifique! It makes Phillipe's version limp with a broken accent (whatever that means) especially since you actually get to dip it here as opposed to the pre-dipped version there.Some reviewers (not just Yelpers) seem to have some apprehension about the safety of the neighborhood and even go so far as to conjecture that Langer's curbside delivery on faxed orders is for the really squeamish. Having lived in cities most of my adult life, I think this is a bit of middle class panic. It's a daytime restaurant and most of the customers are downtowners and it's not scary, people.

Nothing tastes that great. the cole slaw was okay, i couldnt taste the cheese-maybe they should consider melting it. the only pro about my meal was the rye bread which was so fluffy and why this place gets a three not a two. Lastly, their waitstaff is unfriendly. you feel awkward asking your waiter for something like another straw or extra Russian dressing because they are just so grumpy.

Its like everybody else has been doing it wrong and only Langer's has been doing it right. Seriously, holy shit.So let me get down to the food.

My impression of pastrami was that it was very salty.My second experience changed though when I had pastrami with Sophia W. at the Hillcrest Sandwich Co.SO, it seems fitting that my third time having pastrami would be at the highly rated Langer's with Sophia W. again! It seems this girl knows where good pastrami is because this place lived up to its' ratings.When I first arrived in Langer's I was a bit thrown off my the neighborhood. It wasn't necessarily the safest or nicest hood and I immediately regretted walking down the street because I don't think people appreciated my Marc Jacob shades or my Lululemon gear by the death glares they gave me. (I swear I'm not usually this pretentious looking..really, I actually use yoga pants for fitness so, this qualifies me to wear them! I'm not wearing it to JUST be snooty..it's more of a combination of the two).Stepping in Langer's though, it was a quaint (and huge) restaurant. You could tell it's been here for a while and it's definitely a local favorite! We ordered the chili cheese fries to share and of course, the #19.There was something nostalgic about the crinkle cut fries. This was an awesome dish..definitely heavy (duh) but, so good. We both agreed that it could use a bit more chili and cheese though cause by the end of it, we only had fries left.The #19 absolutely stole the spotlight though. Thick slices of pastrami, stacked on rye bread with Russian dressing and coleslaw. Oh my. The pastrami was tender, it was flavorful, it wasn't too salty..it was perfect. The coleslaw and dressing gave a nice bite and sweetness to the soft pastrami.Langer's pastrami compared to The Hat's pastrami is like comparing In n Out to Mcdonalds. There is just no comparison. If you think you don't like pastrami, it's just cause you haven't had good pastrami..at Langers. Our bill came out to about $40.

Mini-me decided on the lunch special of half a Hot Pastrami with Cream Cheese. Sounds weird, but it was actually quite good. OH MAN it was weird that I actually liked the pastrami better than the corned beef. I know corned beef is a bit salty, but not usually more than pastrami (I think). Perfectly sliced pastrami. It was, dare I say... orgasmic. NO no no. Never mind. It wasn't THAT good, it's still just pastrami after all. But for someone like me, that makes Langer's worthy of 5 stars. Other noteworthy items ordered were the Chili Cheese Fries which were great! Piping hot fries with freshly grated cheese. A steal at $4.95, considering the prices on the sandwiches. We also shared a bowl of matzo ball soup. How could we not? We rarely venture out to Jewish deli's, so.. when in Rome. Er, Langer's. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs really, and could have done without the soup. I thought it was fairly average. I liked the broth much better than the two balls. (hehe).The potato salad! I love the potato salad from Philippe's and sadly it was sub par compared to that. However, it could have been that we were so stuffed that my taste buds could handle no more. No big. The friendly waitresses packed it all up nice and neat and we took that ish to-go. Easily found street parking over on Westlake. Passed by a lot of sketchy characters, but so worth it for the food. That #88 had just as much sauerkraut as there was corned beef. Disgusting? Yes. Disgustingly DELICIOUS.

At the time, I felt that all pastrami tasted the same and it would be best for me to buy it at the supermarket and bring it home and make my own sandwiches.That was my life before Langer's.On a beautiful afternoon, I decided to pay Langer a visit. Driving up to the restaurant, I immediately noticed the long line out the door. Wow, this was around 1pm and there was still a line? I must have come to the right place!After I was seated and perused the menu, I knew that I had to get #19, which is their most popular dish, which consisted of hot pastrami, Russian dressing on rye bread, and homemade cole slaw. I was ready. I was ready to be proven wrong; that there is such a thing as really good pastrami. Soon enough, #19 was laid before my eyes. I took a look at the pastrami and noticed that the pastrami was a different cut. I took a bite. It was love at first bite. Holy cow!!! The beautiful combination of the pastrami, bread, and Russian dressing was out of this world! The pastrami was tender and absolutely flavorful in taste, the bread was fresh and soft, and the Russian dressing was the perfect addition. It cannot get better than this.What makes this restaurant stand out and long standing for years is that they cure, steam, and smoke their own pastrami and bake their own rye bread.

I could barely taste the meat in my sandwich, which made me regret my adornment of it with the slaw and that rich creamy dressing.

They put lots of creamy cream cheese, tomato slices, and load up the pastrami. The flavor combo just works. I also ordered the kasha soup and I loved the broth on this soup. Very flavorful chicken broth with bulgur wheat. I was hoping for veggies also but it was just broth with the bulgur wheat, a Jewish classic.

After being a little blind sided by the neighborhood even though I knew it was next to MacArthur Park, I found parking around the corner. They apparently do have a lot that can be validated for the first hour, but I parked on the street. The lot is just one block down on the corner of Westlake and 7th st.

It's not an awful area, but definitely would be sketchy at night, which is why I now understand the hours of this place.Now let's get down to what really matters. I got the famous #19 while one of my friends got the corned beef and another got the #1, which is basically the #19 without cheese (you don't want her to have cheese). Anyways, the food came out and it was just what I imagined. The pastrami was thick cut, which I am usually not a fan of, but b/c it was so tender and delicious, you really couldn't tell Then the meatyness of that contrasted with the coleslaw and the russian dressing. Perfection. \u00a0They even give you a little side of russian dressing in case you want more. \u00a0What really made this sandwich though was the fresh rye bread that was so soft. I could eat that bread plain for days.

Usually I'm not a big fan of sauerkraut, but it wasn't too overwhelming in this sandwich. We all definitely enjoyed it, but the star of the show was definitely the pastrami. \u00a0My friend also ordered a side of fries, which were pretty standard fries, but a nice addition to the sandwich.The only downfall was the price, which was $14.45 I believe for the #19, but it was such a good sandwich, it's hard to complain.

I first went to Langer's Deli in mid-September 2010--mostly because of tips from fellow Yelpers--and though Langer's is famous for Pastrami, I had the hot corned beef sandwich. No sauerkraut, no cole slaw, just hot corned beef on rye (with Gulden's mustard). Holy cow! The corned beef is so moist and tender. The bread is fresh baked and sliced when you place your order. It is soft (SOFT!) on the inside and really crunchy on the outside. I love Canter's, but I have to say Langer's beats them in the corned beef on rye department (though I will admit Canter's gives you a sandwich--taller, but smaller--for less money). But that's okay. Langer's sandwich is big enough for me. And the flavor is...well, it's the best damned hot corned beef sandwich I've ever had!This review is not about anything else at Langer's. That's because I can't stop myself from ordering the corned beef every time I go.The garlicky pickels are great, the cole slaw (on the side) is good. The potato salad and macaroni salad were nothing special.And I love the kugel!Finally, the service is very friendly and professional. First class! I'll add that in the many times I've been there, I've had a number of different servers. Every one of them has been courteous, helpful and friendly.

I drove by a few months ago and the line was out the restaurant and around the corner so I figured it had to be good with that many people queued. I didn't want to wait that day and ended up coming back on a Saturday afternoon.There wasn't any line outside (score!) and my friends and I were the second group to be seated once we went in. This is where our luck ran out. After being seated and watching waiters and waitresses walking around to every table but our for 20 minutes the hostess that seated us noticed that no one had come by to take our order. She said she would talk to our waiter and ask him to come by for us. After another 10 minutes of waiting (30 minutes now) she came back and noticed that the waiter still had not come by. She was very apologetic and even took our order for us to speed things along. The silly thing is that we were only going to order a pastrami sandwich and a soda so we could have been in and out in the time that we sat waiting.We got the sandwich a few minutes later and it was pretty good. There was a lot of chunked pastrami and it went really well with the Russian dressing and rye bread.After waiting another 15 minutes (50 minutes total now) the hostess that had been taken our order came by and asked if anyone had some to see us yet. When we told her no one had she set out to find someone to check up on us. A few minutes later a waitress came by, handed us a bill, and walked off. No questions about refills, no questions about wanting anything else, nothing whatsoever. The total for the bill came out to be $19 for a sandwich and a soda. If the service had been better (not an hour of waiting and feeling like we were 3rd class citizens) I wouldn't have cared so much about the tab. I paid my bill and personally handed gratuity to the hostess as she was the only person that actually seemed to care.Maybe I was there on an off day but seeing as how we were treated when there was no line outside I really don't want to go back and try this place again.", "Date": "2010-08-20", "Author_Location": "Burbank, CA"}, {"Author": "Charlie C.", "ReviewID": "rKRJ9DawyrNwbusONHGgCw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been here a couple of times and I've been extremely satisfied both times. \u00a0The first time I had corned beef and cabbage (it being St. Patty's day and all), and this past time, I had the pastrami dip sandwich. \u00a0The bread was cooked perfect: slightly crispy but still soft. \u00a0Quality of the meat is excellent and service is great as well.Only downside? \u00a0They aren't cheap. \u00a0For a sandwich and a drink, you'll probably walk out of there paying b/w $15-$18, and if you're getting the corned beef & cabbage, it's like $22 for the plate alone (before tax and tip). \u00a0It's def not a place you want to eat lunch at everyday, but the food makes you come back for sure.Tip:There's free parking diagonally across the intersection. \u00a0Don't forget to get validated.", "Date": "2011-11-29", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Aang A.", "ReviewID": "SQJet9O8q2EZW6ZwUKg8QQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Theres only 2 good things on the menu.

So my review will be a comparison between the 2. Their Rye Bread is one of the best I\"ve had. At first I thought for sure the Pastrami would be the star of the show but the bread was just so perfect. Perfect toasty crust and oohhh so soft middle. I had the famous #19 which is the Pastrami on rye with Swiss Cheese, Coleslaw, and Russian Dressing. This #19 combination is Brilliant!!! Every component complimented the sandwich. Sweet tanginess of the coleslaw, the rich juicy slices of pastrami, the earthiness of the swiss cheese, and then the lil kick from the Russian dressing. Brilliant!!!The other sandwich we tried was the Pastrami/ Chopped liver with Russian Dressing on Rye. I have to start off and say that I LOVE liver. So I also really enjoyed this dish. It added an extra irony meaty flavor which I liked. But in comparison to the #19 I missed the coleslaw. I wanted to order it with the coleslaw but the waiter insisted that I didnt. Since it was my first time I wanted to listen to him. We did not share any sides .. I have read mixed reviews on the crinkle fries so we did without them. The cream soda was pretty good. Reminds me of childhood. So I'd have to say that Langers does live up to the hype. And that #19 is something I can eat everyday. Comparing just the Pastrami alone.. I'd have to say Katz in NY takes the trophy. Katz's pastrami is juicer and more moist .. almost like a fatty piece of prime rib. Katz's cuts are a little thicker and it is good even on it's own. Langers overall with the fixings is a winner. Glad I was able to finally try this placeArea is kinda shady. YOu see random individuals just walking back and forth probably up to no good.

I saw the reviews and decided it was time to try their pastrami since I have been on the hunt for the perfect pastrami sandwich for a while. My roommate and I hopped in the car and made it down in a few minutes and parked in the private lot that requires validation (1 hour free) but it's owned by Langers so it's not difficult at all. It's on the corner of 7th and Westlake if anyone needed to know.After walking down the block to Langers we were greeted with a smile by the host/manager and immediately escorted to an empty booth. This was all surprising considering the many reports I had heard about their long lines but our timing was before the lunch rush so if anyone wants to know, 11am is probably the latest you can show up without expecting a wait. The booths are classic overstuffed seats with pleather covers and brass buttons and comfortable to sit in. The menu is extensive and even though we had planned what we wanted to get ahead of time, I took some extra time to look at the menu and see what my next trip might have in store. Our server was a kind young man who was readily available for most of our meal but did not offer much in the way of suggestions for first timers. No matter, we knew what we wanted anyways. For our appetizer we ate the creamed herring and for lunch we split the classic #19 Pastrami with cole slaw and russian dressing on rye and the #3 corned beef with swiss and sauerkraut on rye.The creamed herring was an impressive spread of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, herring and 2 types of pickles. It was very fresh and very delicate and not heavy at all for a starter. The creaminess in the herring was not simply the sauce that covered it, but could be tasted all the way through the white meat. Very good platter.The sandwiches were everything we expected and more. The corned beef was cooked to perfection and while it was an excellent sandwich, I felt the pastrami was better balanced with its alternately sweet and salty flavors as well as a more buttery texture to the meat. I was not disappointed in either one at all, but when I return I want to try the corned beef sandwich prepared like the #19 so I can see how the slaw plays with a different type of meat. Speaking of slaw it really was perfect. Not too much mayo, not too dry, and full of fresh vegetable flavors. As an experience it was great. The service was good, the customers were happy and kept that way for the duration of their (and our) meals, Langer's is a testament to the \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" mantra and they haven't had to fix anything for a long time I imagine.Some people might cry foul that I did not give a 5-star review for a place a I clearly enjoyed but the fact of the matter is, 5-stars means there is absolutely nothing to improve upon and that simply is not the case. The sandwiches were incredible and the appetizer was great but $24 each after tip is a steep price for even a total sandwich-nut like myself.

Of course, I come here for the pastrami on rye, which IMO is served to that 'as good as it gets' level, especially in this town. Yea, there are rivals as well, but this would definitely go in my top 3 . Meat here is seasoned and served at the proper temperature and the bread is crispy on the outside and soft in the middle- all as it should be. It's that diner where you can feel comfortable being in and sitting there laughing it up with the waitress and some good company. Sometimes I wish it would rain hard enough that the drops would hit the windows, so i can sit at the booth, look out at the streets and give that wondering soul stare. Yeaaa... that kind of diner.The gist...High points: Has everything a diner should have. Pastrami is a must if you're looking to find some of the best LA has to offer. Don't expect those shredded super thinly sliced pastrami meats like at The Hat or other fakers. This is a slab of thick cuts the way pastrami is meant to be served. Oh yea, its a diner, so they should have all the usuals.Low points: Some of you are going to find the prices to be a bit steep, especially for a sandwich, but seems pretty standard to me no matter where I go.", "Date": "2010-04-28", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Bertha C.", "ReviewID": "0SmoeC3yziti4JQniEB-vA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BEST pastrami EVER.

The atmosphere is not stuffy and there are plenty of locals in the restaurant as expressed by the servers and their wonderful hellos and welcome backs. I also had a chance to try the Reuben with Corned Beef. It was good but not comparable to the Pastrami on Rye. The quality of the meats here is what makes it so good.

In 2001 Langer's was the James Beard Foundation winner of the Bertolli Olive Oil America's Classics Award. This award is given to a restaurant that is locally owned with timeless appeal and beloved for quality food. I knew all of these things the minute I walked through the door at Langer's.Langer's opened up in 1947 on the corner of Seventh St and Alvarado, just East of Downtown Los Angeles. Founded by Al Langer, who died after the 60th anniversary and is now ran by his son Norm Langer. I really love the locally owned establishments.Touting the title Home of The Worlds Best Pastrami Sandwich. I immediately started to draw comparisons to east coast pastrami power hour Kat's Delicatassen in New York City. Unlike the Kat'z pastrami Langer's, comes dressed up.Langer's does their pastrami with a welcomed twist. The world renowned #19 is stacked high with tender juicy thick cut pastrami, homemade coleslaw, Swiss cheese and Russian dressing. The sweet from the coleslaw combined with the juicy fat of the pastrami was like heaven in my mouth. Being a mayonnaise lover at heart, the Russian dressing was a welcome add on to this glorious creation. The Swiss cheese did not jump out at me but I think that was a good thing. It fell in line with pastrami, coleslaw and Russian dressing. It was so juicy and flavorful. And the Rye bread was perfect. It was warm and soft in the middle with hard crust, but not too hard. I don't like the crust that cuts the roof of your mouth. This was perfect.It is not easy saying this because I was so impressed with the pastrami at Katz's but Langer's title of worlds best is legit. The #19 is the best pastrami sandwich I have had, on both coasts. I know this is going to a hard bite to swallow, especially for you NY heads but the #19 is world class.

I went to Langer's a few years ago. I had a cup of the cabbage soup and immediately sensed I was in for a treat. It only got better once they brought me the #19. It was more than memorable -- it is my reference point for all other pastrami -- and all other sandwiches for that matter. A few years pass, I am back in LA and we decide we must make a trip to Langer's. I consider ordering something else for fear that the #19 might disappoint. As time passes it is easy to elevate a food experience to something a little more than it was. With time often comes nostalgia -- and a memory or experience can become idealized. You try and recreate the experience and so often it disappoints. It's difficult to know if it is in fact a lesser experience than the original -- or if emotions played a part in distorting the memory of the original experience.It would have been very easy to pick something else, it was 11 am -- so breakfast and lunch were an option and like any great deli, Langer's menu offers many different items in many different combinations. After deliberating, I knew I had to go with the #19 -- \u00a0hot pastrami, cole slaw, a slice of Swiss cheese and Russian dressing on hot rye.Truth be told, it was better than last time. The bread's crust was thicker -- it was more like a shell than a crust -- and of course the pastrami was delicious. My next trip I might just get a pastrami on rye with mustard -- I can't imagine it could get much better than that and the absence of cole slaw, cheese and dressing might be a better format to let the real stars of the sandwich shine. I left knowing that was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had -- and perhaps at the very top of the list.I am not alone in that opinion. Nora Ephron, in his article that appeared in The New Yorker, wrote the following:The hot pastrami sandwich served at Langer's Delicatessen in downtown Los Angeles is the finest hot pastrami sandwich in the world.Langer's is also the proud recipient of the coveted James Beard Foundation award.

Everything works on this sandwich and the slaw and russian dressing does not overpower the wonders and aura of the pastrami. Like they said in Friday, \"this [sandwich] tastes so good, that it makes you wanna slap yo momma!\" Another good sandwich that Langers serve is the #54 which is their pastrami/corned beef combo.

Langer's sits on the corner of 8th and Alvarado across the street from McArthur Park with easy access from the Metro Light Rail (Red/Purple Line).Anyway, I walked in and the place looks pretty neat, kinda like the inside of an old vintage diner atmosphere. I approached the lady at the counter and proceeded with my to-go order for the #19, the pastrami with slaw on rye, but as I noticed the thick pieces of pastrami, I asked for the pastrami thin sliced (as I usually have it elsewhere). The woman at the counter then proceeded to bring the order slip to the kitchen and begin to make my sandwich.In about five minutes, the worker acknowledged me, and notified that my order was ready. He was very kind to give me a few extra packets of mustard when I only wanted a pack or two. I got back in my car, and drove home. I unwrapped the sandwich and I found the sandwich to look \"heart-shaped\" which was pretty cool. Now that, I did not expect. I took a first bite and thought it was missing something. I took a bigger bite, and I definitely knew it was missing something. THE MUSTARD was missing! I threw on some mustard on the sandwich and my my, it hit the spot! They also put the pickles on the side, which I didn't really care much for, so I just ate them separately. After finishing the first half of the sandwich, I decided to try each of the ingredients separately for the second half. Here's a breakdown of each ingredient:Pastrami: Surprising delicious, even though they could have added a bit more salt. But hey, everyone's different, so salt to taste. There was so much texture in the pastrami with the right amount of fat, it was so good I didn't even care that it wasn't salty enough. I did order the pastrami thin sliced, so maybe I'll try it with thick slices as they normally prepare it next time.Slaw: Not bad, but not the best I've had either. I personally prefer slaw from Southern BBQ restaurants, but their's wasn't bad at all though. It did compliment the sandwich just fine. Rye Bread: The bread was delicious, and very soft. The dressing/slaw made the bread just a bit soggy, which I really do not mind at all! In fact, it made the bread quite enjoyable to eat. Unfortunately, like James N, I'm also not a fan of breads having hard crusts either. No big deal about the crust really, I could have just asked for it to be removed like James had.Rating Breakdown: Atmosphere: 5/5Service: 5/5Parking: 3.5/5 Food: 4/5 (Still have yet to try other sammiches!

I'll just give a quick review of everything I've tried to make this review as short as possible.Although their sandwich menu looks extensive, it honestly is far from it. They have the same types of sandwiches, but rotate the type of meat. \u00a0I have to say the pastrami is my favorite with the roast beef at a close second and the corned beef is faaar behind. The corned beef is too salty for my taste. The Pastrami is just amazing. I love it here because they give you thick cuts of meat so you can really get a sense of how amazingly tender, moist, and flavorful the meat is. COMBINATION SANDWICHES#3 Corned beef, swiss cheese, and sauerkraut is a very salty thumbs down#19 pastrami is a must order/try#44 Pastrami, sauerkraut and nippy cheese is also a must try#24 roast beef, lettuce, tomato, and russian dressing was good, nothing beats their pastramiFrench Dipped Sandwiches - Both the pastrami and roast beef versions are really good! They have a great Au Jus sauce.SIDES - \u00a0Home fries: You really need a table of four to eat this bad boy. Its basically an undercooked hash brown. A very large, fills an entire plate, undercooked hash brown. - \u00a0Regular Crinkle Fries: ehhh, its just fries - \u00a0Chili Cheese (crinkle) fries - Above review, but with a very oil chilly cheese splatter on top and a puddle on the bottom. Its a good oily mess =) - \u00a0Barley Mushroom with Giblets Soup: Yuuum...very good on a cold day. Its basically a chicken soup with barley. I love barley in my soup so I would order this again.  - \u00a0Matzo Ball Soup: I'm not a fanDESSERTApple Pie with Brandy sauce a la mode: It came out steaming as if it were freshly baked! The brandy sauce is very pungent, so be warned. The combination of the three was just delicious. The brandy and apple pie would be sweet and warm together, but the vanilla ice cream cools and mellows out the flavors.A must must order!!!Strawberry shortcake with ice cream: Its wonderful to look at....but thats about it.

Retreating to SoCal every now and then, I learned of Langer's from a magazine article, and immediately said to myself, \"It will be mine... Oh yes, it will be mine.\"On our way to \"the happiest place on Earth,\" the gf, the cousin, the dog and I skip the traditional chicken fried steak and eggs breakfast at Mike's Roadhouse in Kettleman City along I-5, and head straight for the Westlake district of LA for some gnoshing. As we approach Langer's, we notice something... We're in the freakin' ghetto. The weather was quite warm, we had the dog with us, so we decide that perhaps it's best to get it to-go rather than risk having our car broken into and losing everything we brought with us for our little four-day excursion.Looking at the menu posted in the window made my mouth water, but the prices immediately made my palate flaccid. I've paid $17 for a sandwich before, but that was a Kryptonite from Ike's (inspired by Man v. Food) which was a 5 lbs. sandwich. Needless to say, this sandwich better be worth is.I ordered a # 80-something. It had pastrami, Swiss cheese and sauerkraut with mustard on rye. The gf ordered a pastrami on rye with LIVERWURST (Ugh!) and the cousin ordered the traditional #19. In total, we spent $45... $45??? For sandwiches??? These better be the best sandwiches that have ever graced my mouth with its presence...I speed for as long as I can down I-5 so that we can eat, but unfortunately because LA is the only place in the world that has 6-lane freeways and 24 hour traffic, we have to hold our appetites for another 40 mins.I will say that Langer's knows how to pack a hot sandwich; it was purposefully wrapped in butcher paper to ensure maximum heat retention without creating soggy bread from meat juices and condensation. My sandwich was beautifully made, the meat was juicy, tender and a little fatty (in other words, PERFECT), and like a well-scripted sitcom/TV series leaves you wanting MORE. The gf's sandwich gave her the runs unfortunately; liverwurst=BAAAAAAD. The cousin inhaled his sandwich and forgot to taste it on the way down.I will say that Langer's is good, but it's not $15-a-pop good. Yes, the bread is fresh, and yes, the pastrami is juicy, tender and a bit fatty. But price-wise, I can't warrant spending almost $50 on SANDWICHES that really didn't satisfy the hunger.", "Date": "2010-04-22", "Author_Location": "Hayward, CA"}, {"Author": "Daniel C.", "ReviewID": "gE1sG7lL7hNln_OAif1-cA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I've been going here for lunch more than a few times every month.

It's probably the best part of about their corned beefs/pastramis. Their corned beef is ok, a little thickly sliced for my liking but still pretty good.

I preferred the #19 as this cabbage was raw rather than pickled and didn't taste as heavy. Not that #88 was bad, it was very good! And #19 was melt-in-your-mouth perfection. The waitress saw our cameras, and asked if she could send the owner over to chat with us, and we said sure! Norman was extremely friendly, chatted with us three times while we were there and answered all our questions, including the one I'm sure he hears all the time, \"what's the difference between corned beef and pastrami?\" And if you're curious: their corned beef/brisket comes from two layers of meat around the breast plate of the cow. Their pastrami comes from the steer, \u00a0from a different cut of meat, closer to the belly. And it uses different spices. Other places might use the brisket of beef interchangeably, but Langer's is different. fyi.I nearly boffed my dining companion as I was feeling plenty vindicated on my complaint that LA's driving and parking sucks, due to the asstrocious driving and parking we experienced getting there, but there IS free parking to be had, just for Langer's customers.

One of my favorite things about this place was ordering a pastrami and corned beef sandwich and seeing this hot, steaming, gargantuan pile of fatty meat and coleslaw barely covered by the top slice of bread. All koshered-up of course. Now I can eat one and barely feel the food coma-ing knockin'.And let's put in a third hand. One thing that hasn't change is this place is ghetto.

I will order this again and again when I go back. \u00a0While I like #19, having the sandwich grilled gives it a uniqueness that I can't describe. \u00a0 Even my nephew loved it, he called the sauerkraut, white kimchi - only if he knew how it was made.Overall, I'll rate 4 stars for my first experience at Langers. \u00a0I would definitely recommend #44, but if you have the room, order #19 as well... heck, take another friend so you can try half of each sandwich. \u00a0 \u00a0Now, as the price goes, it's pricey I'll admit. \u00a0I think the price on each was around $14.50 per sandwich, but it was worth it. \u00a0Also, you can call ahead and they have curve side service... Once you get the check, go up to the front to pay... cash is always welcomed, but they take visa and mastercard. \u00a0As we left, there was a line outside waiting for empty tables... give yourself enough time if you go during lunch.", "Date": "2010-12-28", "Author_Location": "Ann Arbor, MI"}, {"Author": "Alex D.", "ReviewID": "lVi64ygIuQFTmTpJvfqNNw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can you say about a Deli which survived for over 65 years on the corner of Alvarado and 7th street? A lot of good things!Back in the heyday of Los Angeles, this neighborhood used to be what the better part of Hollywood is now. However, when you fast forward to 2011 and upon parking your car on a credit card operated parking meter while being approached from all sides by Latino-Americans asking if you need a fake ID, you immediately know that this deli has got to be very, very special. After all it's still standing.It seems like the place and many of its' patrons along with the waiters have been there since the opening in 1947. Don't get the wrong idea here, the prices are definitely up to date along with the service and the selection. I visited Langer's around 2pm and it was full with regulars and lots of LAPD officers. Now you know that the place must be good if cops eat there.After reviewing a very generous menu, I went for the classic. A Roast Beef with Swiss, Cole Slaw and Russian dressing on rye. Price: fifteen bucks. However, for the amount of food that I got it was well worth it. The sandwich, served with half-sour pickles, was superb. Fresh bread, extra moist and tender roast beef and perfectly seasoned cole slaw. Could not ask for anything else. It's a shame that the restaurant is only open until 4pm. I would have absolutely loved to have a late night breakfast or steak after a night on the town. Regardless, I will be back for the fish and chips as well as the all American classic like Grilled Liver and Onions or Meatloaf.As I sat indulging in my carnivorous lunch sandwich goodness I began to look around and could not help but to be transcendent back to the 50's.

Like others have written, let's go on record on one important thing: is the pastrami at Langer's better than Katz's or 2nd Ave Deli in NYC. No. Now that that's out of the way, let's get down to business. \u00a0Langer's is as good as it's gonna get in Los Angeles and is mighty cheaper than booking a flight and schlepping out to LaGuardia. Langer's even validates for parking! On a direct pastrami to pastrami comparison, i felt that the meat at Langer's was a bit too \"lean\" for my traditional NY style tastes. \u00a0The NYC stuff just tastes fattier and juicier. \u00a0Perhaps it appeals to our \"tofu and goat cheese\" palette here in LA, but all things said, Langer's meat still makes for a fantastic sandwich. \u00a0Maybe next time, i need to order \"extra meat\" to make it comparable to the NYC stuff too. \u00a0The prices are cheaper at Langers, but you get less pastrami on a standard sandwich. That might make all the difference in flavor and the sense of meatiness.One thing that stands out about Langer's pastrami sandwich is the rye bread. \u00a0Even the NYC stuff is just laid out on soft and somewhat limp bread. \u00a0Langer's rye is not only soft and flavorful, but the crust has this fantastic crusty 'crunch' to it that gives a really nice texture. \u00a0I think this bread, combined with the competent pastrami, makes this an overall wonderful sandwich. \u00a0The matzo ball soup was also \"almost as good\" as the NYC stuff. \u00a0I just got the plain matzo ball with just chicken soup. \u00a0Maybe next time, i'll want to dress it up with some other available add ons. \u00a0The matzo ball was fluffy and airy and didn't remind me of lead weight. The pickles were also very tasty with a fresh and snappy flavor without being overly pickled. \u00a0I will force myself to try some other things on the menu as well, but there really isn't anything else to nick pick so far about this LA institution. \u00a0Between Katz's not taking credit cards and 2nd Ave Deli being cramped and small, each place has their own set of issues too. \u00a0But considering I'm comparing Langer's to NYC staples, that's not bad company to measure up to, especially for an LA joint.", "Date": "2011-05-31", "Author_Location": "Marina del Rey, CA"}, {"Author": "Chrissy E.", "ReviewID": "m2vede96V7tnEyPA5WlM1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the area already and was starving.

The pastrami is nice and thick, but it is so moist and tender. The russian dressing and coleslaw and perfect complements to balance the meat. But the star of the dish really was the rye bread! For me, the bread can make or break the sandwich. Too hard and it can tear apart the roof of your mouth. Too soft and it will get all soggy. Langer's Rye Bread: perfect! Soft enough to soak up some of the meat juice, but hard enough to give a nice texture.Like most good Pastrami sandwiches, a bit pricey. But you pay the price for the pastrami you get.

I knew it was going to be a good experience then (:The food came within another 10 minutes and just like that I was in heaven. I got the French Dip Pastrami sandwich and oh godd it was good. The pastrami was so moist and juicy; the roll was so perfectly light and chewy and the french dip was NOT tainted by some creamy sauce. It was a straight up amazingly foodgasmically inducing dip. My friend got the pastrami sandwich with saurkraut and nippy cheese (which is a spicy American cheese) and boy you can really taste the spices in that sandwich! \u00a0We also split a large order of fries which was a nice side to the sandwiches. On the pricey side ($14 a sandwich and about $4 for the fries) but I guess that's why they've been able to maintain such a high quality sandwich for so long.Honestly, splurge when you come here and you won't be disappointed. I wanted to only give 4 stars because the payment organization at the end is confusing and they don't give you anything to nosh on while you're waiting for your food but... The food is just TOO good to be true.Please come here and please eat the pastrami sandwich. You won't be disappointed (though you might be poorer by the time you leave)!Also...

Greenblatt's charges $15 and they're on the Sunset strip.I don't get it.On top of all that, the pastrami is actually pretty dry I realized.

They were pancakes.*Based on the 6 other people who ordered #19s... the #19 is GREAT. It's a similar thickness/seasoning to the famous Katz pastrami in NY, but the sandwich is a lot less overwhelming and not quite as monstrous in size. It also comes with yummy coleslaw to balance out the meal --- not to mention, a YUMMY pickle.*If you're a fan of cream soda, the other folks would heartily recommend it--plus, free refills!*Fries are GREAT. Warm, crinkle-cut, yum. Not a huge serving, but enough for 2, definitely.SERVICE was swell. The first time we came, I loved our server. She was super sweet, helpful, answered all our questions, and just made us feel at home. Our second server wasn't necessarily bad or not lovely, but just didn't exude warmth as much. -shrug- She did, however, warn us that she thought we were ordering too much food, which was considerate.LOGISTICS*Park on 7th & Westlake in the Langer's parking lot. They validate for up to 90 minutes, which can be just enough time despite the long wait. The attendants are friendly and even if it says \"LOT FULL,\" double-triple check because sometimes there are still open spots and it's worth asking.*They close at 4pm. *No reservations. Come prepared to wait in line. The first time I came (NYE during prime lunch time), our party of 4 waited abouuuuut 30 minutes. The second time I came (on a Saturday, late lunch, nice weather out) our party of 6 waited maybe 15 minutes--wahoo!*There are a couple of huge heaters to accompany you as you wait in line, but the line is outdoors.Will probably end up there again as one of our \"when people come to LA\" spots, but I wouldn't recommend it for a group of more than one vegetarian/vegans... just not enough to satisfy!", "Date": "2013-01-06", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Josh D.", "ReviewID": "VknYAKL7QScXo07jPRmJ-A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Langer's was just okay and definitely doesn't live up to its hype.

If you read my reviews you know that I judge a deli not by its pastrami but by its corned beef. The reasoning is very simple. Corned beef has to be of a higher quality than the beef used in pastrami. In fact, any number of cuts can be used for pastrami. It is basically a pickling of the beef with spices. The corned beef is a higher cut of beef. The pastrami at Langer's is bland, almost tasting at times like a hot dog.The bread is very good. Crunchy crust, moist chewy center. I would like to return some day and try the corned beef.

The salty seasoning of the pastrami, mixed with the crunchy sweetness of the slaw and Russian dressing, along with the Swiss cheese made for an amazing combination. The side of pickles that came with the sandwich was perfect for adding a necessary tartness to cut the fat of the meat and sweetness of the slaw. I asked for the bread toasted because I knew that I was going to be taking the other half to go and wanted to prevent the bread from becoming too soggy. I gobbled up the first half and couldn't wait to get into the other half later on that day. For a medium sized sandwich, it's a little pricey at around $15 bucks.

Time to revisit Langers.As far as traditional NY jewish deli style (rye bread, russian dressing, etc) pastrami sandwiches go, the no 19 at Langers is the best I've had in So Cal. The pastrami has a mild smoky flavor, the rye bread and russian dressing are good, I really liked it as I remembered. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the cole slaw and russian dressing overpowered the pastrami flavor just a little bit. Their house pastrami is very good and next time I might order a stripped down version of this sandwich with no cole slaw and less russian dressing. Overall, the quality of the sandwich is good, but not quite up to the quality of the best delis in NY such as Katz, but it's not far off. Also, I'm not sure if I like Langers better than some of my other pastrami faves in So Cal such as The Hat and Bruxie, but those are hard comparisons, since they are totally different non-traditional pastrami sandwiches. I would say that Langers pastrami is better, and it should be because it is house made, but not sure if I like the overall sandwich better..... tough call. Bruxie for example is a waffle sandwich with a totally different taste and The Hat is a dipped sandwich on a soft white hoagy roll with mustard. The Hat pastrami is a little on the greasy side, but the dipped approach works well for them. Bruxies cider slaw and thinly sliced sour pickle really work well with the waffle approach even though the Boarshead pastrami they use is not at the level of a top notch house made pastrami. \u00a0I probably won't be visiting Langers for a while because it's too far from my house, but I will stop by again if I'm in the area.

I've been to both Mexico City and Guadalajara but I doubted what I had read that Los Angeles was third on the list until Saturday, Jan 14, 2012. I grew up in So. Cal and have been to LA many times but my goodness that neighborhood around McArthur Park (where Langer's resides) on a Saturday afternoon has soo many of my peeps that it's almost overwhelming I'm like \"yo\" is this Mex-cutta. Anyway enough about the neighborhood, if you are coming to Langer's they have a parking lot on 7th and Westlake, you can park their for free as long as you spend $5 or more at Langer's (which shouldnt be hard) and make sure you get your ticket validated. They close at 4:00 p.m. which is weird until you visit here and see the neighborhood, good on ya Langer's \"safety 1st\"I visited Langer's with a large group of about 20. Considering the size of the group I think the service was pretty darn good. Our waiter Ari, didn't seem frustrated or flustered as he serviced the entire group considering all the special requests. I thought he did pretty good considering. My wife and I split the coveted #19 (pastrami, coleslaw, cheese, russian dressing) and the beef brisket french dip. The french dip was pretty good, that au jus sauce was pretty special, probably the best I've ever had, very meaty and enhanced the flavor of the sandwich quite well. A local teen that was with us that had grown up in LA's City Centre said she thought Langer's French Dip was better than Philippe's which I've heard is the birthplace of the French Dip sandwich.The #19 however is pretty darn good, I see why it's the house favorite (they have a sign as soon as you walk in, proclaiming this). I'm not a fan of rye bread but my goodness, soft on the inside, crusty on the outside and combined with the pastrami and other ingredients, it's absolute perfection. By far the best pastrami i've ever had, I wasnt aware pastrami was meant to be this colour.

I must confess, I'm not a big pastrami person. I think it's delicious, sure, but I usually don't seek it out. But since this is supposed to be Ground Zero for pastrami in LA, I had to try it. I opted for the #10, so I could get the cole slaw on the side. Took a little while for the sammy to come out, but wow, when it did was it good. The pastrami itself was quite lean, which I guess it always isn't the case, and to tell you the truth I could've used a little more fat in there, but it was still quite delish. What really made the sandwich for me though was their rye bread with the wonderful crunchy crust! And the Russian dressing was a tangy creamy treat as well. It was so good I ended up eating the whole thing, even though just a half would've been quite enough to satisfy. Dan H and I were saying later we should've just split a sandwich between us--oh well! Their cole slaw was quite good as well, fresh, crisp and sweet with just the right amount of mayo. I think I prefer slaw that has cabbage sliced a bit more substantially with more celery seeds, though, so I can't say this was the best slaw I've had. Next time I want to try their tongue sandwich and the chopped liver, as those are usually the items I go for at a Jewish deli. Getting here and finding parking's no picnic, so prepare yourself. It's a SUPER-busy intersection teeming with more pedestrians than you've ever seen in LA, probably. I thought I was on Avenida Revolucion for a sec (that's Tijuana, folks). Even though their parking lot was full I was able to find free street parking a couple of blocks away, which is probably a good thing, considering how much I pigged out.

\u00a0Child's play. \u00a0Canter's? \u00a0Oh please.Get the #19. \u00a0It's the obvious favorite, and if you're the kind of person who doesn't like going with the crowd, I'd suggest you make an exception here. \u00a0This is just one of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat. \u00a0The pastrami, as mentioned above, is unbelievable - thick slabs with the perfect texture and the perfect amount of fat seasoned to perfection. \u00a0The pastrami is heaped between two pieces of wonderful rye, soft and spongey enough that your thumb leaves little imprints, but pliant enough that the imprints start to spring back. \u00a0The crust on the rye is equally awesome, not hard but not without hardness. \u00a0The additions of Swiss cheese, coleslaw, and Russian dressing are probably not necessary, but they really kick things up a notch, as do the delicious crisp pickles. \u00a0The pastrami remains the star, and I'm sure you could do okay with any pastrami sandwich at Langer's - I just think it's silly to tinker with perfection and will continue to order the #19.While the pastrami is the most amazing thing at Langer's, almost everything I've tried is superb. \u00a0The #88 is a beautiful corned beef with Swiss cheese and some great saurkraut. \u00a0The meat is leaner with a little less pizzazz than the pastrami, but it's truly fantastic, probably the best corned beef I've ever had. \u00a0The best corned beef just can't best the best pastrami. \u00a0The matzoh ball soup is another best - the matzoh ball floats and when you touch it it kind of goes boing boing, very cute and fluffy. \u00a0It tastes as great as it looks, just the right texture and just lovely with the lightly salty broth. \u00a0Matzoh ball soup can easily taste like chicken noodle (see: Canter's), but this was more mellow and complex. \u00a0The only thing I would skip at Langer's are the fries. \u00a0They aren't bad, but they aren't good enough to merit stomach space with so much awesome on the menu.My only complaints about Langer's have nothing to do with the food. \u00a0First, the place is only open for lunch, so if you're dying for pastrami at 1 AM or even 7 PM, no meat for you. \u00a0Second, the parking is fairly crazy, and walking to the restaurant, you're liable to be approached by eight different people who want to peddle you fake IDs.Otherwise, I can find little fault with this place. \u00a0It gets really crowded, but I've found that you get seated faster than you'd think, and that the service is efficient and friendly. \u00a0If you're alone, you can grab a seat at the bar with almost no wait at all. \u00a0The space is also bright and lively, with a sense of history to boot.Langer's is a happy place, worth any hassle for the peerless food. \u00a0The biggest downside I can think of is that you might never love another pastrami again.", "Date": "2010-03-21", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Alison F.", "ReviewID": "MsaCtOeqFiFtKHmHkdd9Zw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place...OH this PLACE!

Well, as I watched her expression, I already knew I had to to try THAT sandwich. They were all eating and the wows were making my mouth water at 8am. Well, I decided to go that evening only to find they close at 4pm, so I made it a point to go the following day. I found on the web site that they offer curb side pickup, so how effing great is that? Five minutes before my arrival, I call and order a number 19. They told me the total asked how I'll be paying so they have the change ready, and asked for my car description. I arrive, a guy walks out with a bag, change for a 20, and I was off. Awesome. All I had to worry about from this point was dodging gun fire and hope I'm not tempted to enter a store with a sign in the window claiming \"NOTHING OVER 99cents AND UP\". If only someone could back a huge truck up, load Langer's on it and set it back down somewhere towards Hollywood, like, um, in place of Canters is fine with me, then I would be happier.Now for the food. I can't speak for the place since I never went in, but when I bit into the sandwich, I had my own \"oh my God moment\" Where does that flavor come from? The rye is incredibly soft and flavorful, with a thin and tough crust that puts this in the top breads I've had ever. Overall, its probably the best sandwich in all of Los Angeles. They know how to make a sandwich and the pastrami is fantastic. If I could give 6 stars for the place I would. Being adjacent to Macarthurs Park, its not the best area, but who cares? Its worth it.

I have never tasted such a wholly great pastrami sandwich in my life, down to every detail. I don't know if they make the rye bread themselves but it was amazing: crunchy crust, soft and fragrant bread on the inside, but strong enough to hold the sandwich together. The sandwich includes pastrami, swiss cheese, and cole slaw with Russian Style dressing. The pastrami was fabulous. Also, I usually am not partial to cole slaw thanks to KFC, but this cole slaw was so fresh and not dripping with watery mayo. The hot brownie was awesome, too: steaming hot inside and out, with fudge sauce drizzled on top. It was gigantic, so all 10 of us shared. Totally hit the spot after our salty sandwiches. Service Review: Our waiter was awesome. He offered to take group pictures for us (he gets brownie points from me). Venue Review: There is plenty of seating in the restaurant, both tables and booths, and we were surprised to have a 0 minute wait even on a Saturday afternoon (although it was a little after regular lunch hours). There is metered street parking available. Overall Impression: Hands down greatest pastrami sandwich I've ever had. Fries were average, hot brownie was good.

Taking some out of town guests to this LA institution and I wanted to send the yelp link over to them in anticipation. As I read through the reviews, I was disappointed to read some from incredibly prissy diners. The complaints about the area smacked of ignorance and elitism. No, it ain't my neighborhood but the fear some people described - \". . .you'll either need a concealed carry permit or at least a can of mace to feel safe while walking from your street-parked car to the restaurant.\" is mind boggling. That description may have fit the neighborhood in the eighties. . . AT NIGHT but it's completely false now.I don't want to beat a dead horse, just suffice it to say: if you've got only a modest amount of adventure in your soul and you like cities and diversity, there's nothing the least frightening about this neighborhood. Families with carriages and little shops abound. MacArthur Park is across the street. It's no longer a den of drug dealers so enjoy the view and relax.As for the restaurant, Langers is a throwback. Great food that doesn't pretend to be something it's not. It's a specific type of deli and it serves just the kind of food you'd expect to find there. The pastrami is heavenly and the rye bread is perfect. Combine that with the cole slaw and russian dressing. . . out of this world. I've eaten a lot of pastrami, in LA and NY and this is by far the best I've had.Langers is famous beyond Los Angeles and even New Yorkers rave about it. The decor does look like it's straight out of the '60s but if it's been around that long then they have some magic potion they've used to keep everything in perfect shape. It looks as though everything's been recently reupholstered. And grimy, as one reviewer complained, where does he eat, hospitals? Langers is perfectly clean and has character. It's not everyone's thing, fine, but don't trash the place with outright fabrications.Yes, it's expensive for a sandwich but GREAT pastrami is expensive everywhere and the big, famous New York delis aren't a penny cheaper. . . in fact they're more expensive.I know this has turned into a bit of a rant but some of the comments about the restaurant and, even more, the surrounding area, are more than a little offensive.In short, if you like delis and want a great deli experience, give Langers a shot.

I had lunch there today with my boyfriend and we both really enjoyed it and will definitely return. I do have to admit that I was a bit taken aback by the prices (about $15 for most of their sandwiches,and the breakfast plates seem to hover in the $11-12 range). We came during Friday lunch hour (about 1pm) and there was a line to be seated, so I was looking at the menu hung in the window. Aside from the price though, the sandwich was quite good. We had to try the #19, which was large enough to split between the two of us, and a side of fries. The 19 comes with swiss cheese, Russian dressing, coleslaw and hot pastrami on rye bread. \u00a0I loved the cut of the pastrami--it's thicker than any other pastrami I've had and was delicious. Also, I really can't understand how people complain about the bread. It was soft but nicely toasted on the edges, and warm. The sandwich had a generous portion of meat and coleslaw so the taste of the cheese did get a bit lost. I think I'd like to try the hot pastrami with sauerkraut because I tend to prefer tangy and spicy dishes over sweeter ones like coleslaw. But that's my own preference. It came with a nice crunchy pickle on the side. The fries are crinkle cut (I like crinkle cut but if you don't be forewarned) and weren't too greasy. The portion was big enough for us to share and have some leftover. Some other notes:Despite the line, we were seated in about 15 minutes. We decided what we wanted in under 5 minutes, ordered, and were eating within the next 10 minutes. So if you're hungry, don't get discouraged by the line--once you get in you'll be fed quickly!Apparently their free-with-validation lot can fill up, but if you are able to get a space, park there.

WIth that said, I got the #19 (pastrami, swiss, coleslaw with Russian style dressing on rye) a few days ago and I'm still daydreaming about it. I don't like coleslaw OR rye bread in general but I darn well enjoyed that sandwich. The pastrami was soooo good, and they give you a generous portion--tender, flavorful. To me a good sandwich is one where even if you dislike any component of it (like say, how I don't like coleslaw), you're still able to appreciate why it's in the sandwich -- they all just work together to make the perfect product. THIS WAS IT. So darn good that I don't mind shelling out $15 for a medium sized sandwich (real hefty on the meat though). And everyone in there is so nice and gives me a comforting, homey feeling which I LOVE. Oh and parking tip: Langer's validates for free if you park at their lot on 7th and Westlake!

I opted to have the dressing and slaw on the side so I could taste the pastrami at its purest. I'm not a big fan of fennel nor fat on meat, but when it comes to pastrami, i'm in all the way. They have a large menu selection so there's something for everyone. I also had their macaroni salad (it was a bit too sweet for me, but my bf liked it) and potato pancakes (which i really liked). Their portions are large so come hungry!! Aside from the awesome food, their service was really good. Staff was very friendly and food came quickly. As we walked to the restaurant, they had a little line set-up for customers once it got busy, but I guess we came at the perfect time bc we found street parking and got seated right away. Food's a little pricey for a deli (our bill came out to $45 +tip included) for 1 sandwich, an order of potato pancakes, macaroni salad, and a coke. Regardless, it's a must try since it's one of LA's food staples and apparently, the world's best delicatessen for Pastrami!

Outside, there is a stanchion-and-rope configuration that implies brutal wait times, so I was thankful I was there at 3 pm on a weekday, an hour before closing. The interior is precious, with big vinyl booths, a long linoleum counter, and a big refrigerated case protecting the otherwise open kitchen.

I sat at the counter where I was promptly served my iced tea as I pored over the menu. My decision was quick though - I had to try the popular \"#19,\" pastrami, swiss, and cole slaw on rye with their signature Russian sauce. The picture was making my mouth water. It arrived quickly with a fat pickle sliced in two. The pastrami, which is cut nice and thick, squeezes the soft bread into submission and the drippy cole slaw assures its never too dry. The so called Russian sauce tasted mostly like mayo, and I missed the magical combination of pastrami and mustard. The pickle tasted like it hadn't been pickeled long enough, very plain.

Continuity, that is the word. The neighborhood may have deteriorated but Langer's has retained its essence. \u00a0Yes, if you want the best hot pastrami sandwich on the best crusty baked-on-the- premises rye bread West of the Mississippi, this is still the joint. You can buy a loaf over the counter and have it put into a paper bag, not plastic.That way it will keep its crust. Do you even know that bread is supposed to have a crust? So it's a restaurant. It's about the food and normally I'd say screw the 'dining experience' BS. The truth is that the food at Langer's is not always the best except for a few items like the pastrami and the bread. But in this case even I will also add that it's about the damn 'dining experience'. Mercifully absent, however, will be the wannabe actor who places one hand behind his back to pour your over-priced glass of wine, you sucker. The waitress here started in the seventies and matches the decor. She is now a grandmother. She calls you honey out of long habit, not artifice. She is a walking reminder of what used to be without the phony golden nostalgic glow. She is authentically warm, efficient, courteous, and when necessary tough as nails. She is not in her head. She is from an era when you didn't need to achieve your dream, you just needed to be a 'mench'. And yes, you might bump into our tiny mayor here but he's here because the eating is good. Again, it is not artifice. It is what is called urban culture. LA mayors and assorted city big-wigs and 'machers' have been coming here for lunch since way back, when the place was still Kosher.

The waiters and waitresses are very attentive and polite and the service is quick. Get #19. It's the best sandwich on the planet. I would probably eat my left testicle for a lifetime supply of #19's. This sandwich must have been created by the sandwich God himself. The fresh rye bread is so heavenly: soft on the inside, yet the crust is crunchy and delectable. The pastrami is obviously the star. It is super juicy and tender and tastes fantastic. It's just perfect. You can also get it lean or extra lean (getting lean is free, but extra lean is $3.25 extra.) Don't get extra lean because the fat is where the flavor's at. The coleslaw is also perfect. Crunchy, crisp, perfectly seasoned, and not too wet. I can't stand when cole slaw is drenched in mayonnaise. \u00a0The swiss cheese adds some salt and creaminess, but it's not really needed.

The rye bread they use is genius. For some reason it doesn't get soggy or fall apart despite the large quantity of meat, coleslaw, and dressing that is inside. They do charge a whopping 15 bucks for a sandwich and a pickle (but the pickle is really good and the sandwich is huge). One con: there is no parking anywhere! Street parking is almost impossible to find. Good luck even finding a vacant spot to park temporarily for curbside pick up.

Bar none. I must have been Jewish in another life time because I absolutely love pastrami on rye. It's a beautiful combination.The rye at Langer's is something to be marveled over. I swear, they must have hired some structural engineers to concoct that bread. Marvelously soft in the center, with a heartily crisp crust. Enough structural integrity to hold the Titanic within it, but enough yield to allow a recently de-wisdom-toothed teenager to bite through it (don't try it though, I'm just embellishing).Thick, fragrant slabs of Pastrami line the hallowed insides of the sandwich. Placed ever so perfectly above one another like pleasant, meaty snowdrifts. This isn't your paper thin-sliced Carl Buddig Pastrami if you know what I mean (shouts out to 99 cent deli packets poor college boy concept).The coleslaw I can somewhat do without, especially because it'll make the sandwich soggy should you want to savor the heavenly creation at some latter date and time. But I understand the reasoning behind it, and laud its inclusion.With all of that said, $15 is a little steep for my tastes. As mentioned above, I am a poor college boy, and I can't afford to be shelling out 3 Lincolns (is he on the $5 bill? I hope to God he is, otherwise I'm going to be looking like a fool) for a sammich. I'd rather just make 15 Carl Buddig pastrami sandwiches. Not really.Oh yeah, and I'm obviously talking about the famed #19. I also had fries but those weren't anything special.

There is a bit of fat in the meat (you can order it extra lean, I think it's an add'l $.50 or a $1??) but it's pretty tender and like most foods that are \"unhealthy\" added a bit of savory tenderness and flavor. The meat is hand cut so it's a bit thicker than what I've had elsewhere but it's so tender and juicy and not tough or chewy. So delicious! The sandwich is served with pickles, but if you want a side, it's extra. My brother and I shared the french fries, which of course were the old school crinkle fries. They came out hot, and crispy, a perfect accompaniment to the sandwich. The service was good, prompt, friendly and quick.

I've driven past this place daily for the last few months and there is always a line outside waiting. I assume that means this place rules. So I was seated instantly and Frank was my waiter. Frank was awesome. I ordered an ice tea and the supposed holy grail: #19. I thought the Cole slaw came on the side, but it came on the sandwich. I wish I would have known because I'm not a huge mayonnaise fan whatsoever. Plus there was a Russian style dressing on it as well. Bottom line: the pastrami was probably the best I've ever had, the bread (rye, and I am not a giant rye fan) was amazing. It has this delectable crustiness that was the perfect consistency. Swiss cheese was great. I just can't hang with all of that mayo. I think they should either stick with the Cole slaw OR the dressing but not both. That's overkill to me.

This is the kind of place to take out-of-towners, and they will never forget it. Even the 2-minute walk from the Metro station was entertaining - a man cooking meat over a grill made in a shopping cart, a woman selling a green peeled and cut fruit I couldn't recognize (cherimoya?), and multiple offers for fake IDs and other papers. The location is admittedly a little rough, but the proximity to the Metro makes it easy to take.Tip: if there's a line (ours was about 12 people deep for lunch on Saturday), ask for a counter seat. No waiting!The menu is HUGE and most things are pretty pricey - around $15 for a sandwich. Everyone recommends the #19, which is their world-famous pastrami with swiss cheese, coleslaw and Russian dressing. Unfortunately, that sandwich is HUGE (more than I can eat, and the husband doesn't like pastrami). We were also headed to downtown LA on the Metro for an architecture walk in 90 degree heat, so leftovers weren't really an option. They do sell 1/2 of a #19, but it's only about $1 less than the whole, so instead I settled for 1/2 of a regular pastrami on rye, with a side (coleslaw) for about $12. And yes, it was as fantastic as everyone makes it out to be. The bread was fresh, crispy on the edges and soft inside, the pastrami was thick, caramelized on the ends, and flavorful. The sandwich did not need dressing, cheese or even mustard to make it amazing. The coleslaw was also good - very little mayo (I hate mayo) and tiny bits of green bell pepper that added an interesting flavor.Husband doesn't like pastrami (or corned beef), so he was going to get a 1/2 roast beef sandwich, but our waitress (Barbara) recommended the brisket sandwich instead, because they make the brisket in-house, but the roast beef is just deli roast beef.

In my opinion they do have the best jewish deli sandwiches. I have been to Canter's, Nate N Al's, and Jerry's deli - but I know I am missing one or two in the Valley. I would even compare Langer's to Katz's in New York City. But I think Katz beats Langer's, by a hair. I like the service that Katz has better - where you walk up and order and the guy gives you a small plate sample of the meats. (oh gosh my mouth is watering). . . .back to Langer'sThey have been around for over 60 years. I was reading, at one point, there were open late. When the neighborhood changed, for the worse, the owners, still the same ones, were forced to close early - at 4pm. I asked our waitress if they had thoughts about returning to dinner hours and late night schedules, with new influx of residents in downtown Los Angeles. And she still said no. I do hope they would consider opening for dinner and late night crowds. Hot pastrami sandwiches are great late night drunk fare.I can't explain it, but pastrami beef is one of the few cured and prepared meats that goes good if sliced thinly or thickly. The thin sliced pastrami is what you find at the Hat of Alhambra, Tops of Pasadena, and Johnnie's of Culver City. The thick pastrami is the more traditional jewish cut, found at Canter's, Nate N Al's, and Langer's. Personally, I like the traditional thick cuts. I believe texture is quite important to the eating experience. Thin sliced pastrami seems to fall apart too easily when you pick it up and when you eat it. Sometimes when you bite into the sandwich the little pieces - might often be more tough than you want. Whereas the thick cut pastrami, is expected to have the same texture all around and won't typically fall apart. But I do like the Hat's dipped buns (in the au jus) which gives it a more juicy and squishy feel in your mouth. But for me, my ultimate preference has to be with undipped Rye bread with sauerkraut and russian dressing. For whatever the reason, this combination - which I had for the first time just recently, does it for me. The flavors just melt together in this perfect storm of tanginess, sourness, and savoriness - with this unique taste sensation.Anyways. . . .just go Langer's. Make the trip out there.

Most folks I saw had ordered the #19 so I decided to try it out too. \u00a0The menu itself was quite extensive and the bf was kind enough to answer my questions and make recommendations since he'd been here often before. \u00a0My pastrami was a good hefty size on flavorful rye bread - soft middle with firm crunchy heel - I held it like a pastrami taco to try and keep all the filling it. \u00a0The filling itself was composed of thick sliced tender pastrami, Russian dressing, cheese and cole slaw and I had to keep wiping my lips after every bite. \u00a0Had to pass the halved pickles along to my bf since I don't like them - bleh. \u00a0They did a good blend of lemonade and tea for my large glass of Arnold Palmer which helped me wash down the large side of fries the bf and I shared which I also used to sop up the Russian dressing that escaped my sandwhich onto the plate. \u00a0We passed the two hours just chatting, noshing, and watching the hubbub of the kitchen and wait staff in the open kitchen area. \u00a0Also, since we sat in the middle section of booths we couldn't help but over hear the conversations of the guests around us.I definently recommend Langers if you've got a leisurely long afternoon lunch time just to soak up the atmosphere and give you some time to digest the belly busting pastrami sandwhich.", "Date": "2012-04-04", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Reb R.", "ReviewID": "PrQvdWmO9Ge9rC5f35UaYA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the pastrami with coleslaw and I thought it was pretty good.

I would drive pass this place every time I drove to L.A. but never stopped to try it out. When I heard they were giving away free #19 pastrami sandwiches, I thought \"Hey! Why not, I live close enough.\" Woke up at 6 am that day, got there around 6:40am and waited 2 hours in line until finally it was my turn at the counter booth. And was it worth it? Oh yes indeed. I tried many a pastrami sandwich in my lifetime and never have I come across something quite like this. Firstly, the pastrami meat is more what you'd expect in a corned beef sandwich. It isn't thin and curly, instead you get slabs that are about a quarter inch thick. Second, the coleslaw and dressing makes the flavor unforgettable. And combined with the rye bread, the sandwich has a wonderful texture that makes for a beautiful crunch whenever you take a bite. I have since come back and ordered 2 more #19's so that my family could try, but it felt a little lacking the second time around. I had to take one star off because of the location of the restaurant. It's located in a seedy part of L.A. next to MacArthur Park and parking is difficult unless you're willing to pay for the parking lot specially reserved for Langer's customers. Another reason for the one off is the price. It can get a little pricey. I didn't realize when I was getting it for free but after coming back I saw that the price for a #19 was $15! Having said that, I still think it's worth going to and trying their #19 at least once. I'm glad I had a chance to experience what Langer's was all about and were it not for that anniversary give away, I might have never known.

MMMMM!!!Yes, I've been to Katz's and I would say that Langer's is at least at the same level. \u00a0The two delis share a commonality in that the pastrami at both places is carved by hand, not with a machine slicer. \u00a0That explains why the texture is similar. \u00a0As far as the flavor goes, I give a slight nod to Langer's. \u00a0The place and the neighborhood have definitely seen better days. \u00a0Langer's used to be open until at least midnight (if not 24 hours). \u00a0But, the place was never especially busy after dark when many of the other businesses surrounding MacArthur Park closed for the night. \u00a0So, it was no surprise when Langer's progressively cut their hours further and further back until they got down to just one shift.My understanding is that the opening of the Metro red line basically saved Langer's because it shortened the travel time to and from downtown, and allowed more people to come to Langer's during the lunch and off-peak hours. \u00a0I also appreciate their enterprising ways with curbside pickup. \u00a0With parking as tight as it is during the day, having the curbside service is great.As others have noted, the sandwiches ain't cheap. \u00a0But, this is not fast food pastrami like The Hat or Johnnie's. \u00a0Each of these pastrami variations have their strongsuits, but you definitely pay more for the traditional slow cooked deli fare. \u00a0And if it's best-of-breed stuff like Langer's, it's worth it.", "Date": "2010-02-11", "Author_Location": "Fremont, CA"}, {"Author": "Adrian F.", "ReviewID": "8Ifa171wGYEmGU_UZspJiw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few years ago, I spent a whole summer at NYU where I had easy access to Katz pastrami whenever I want it. 'Heavenly' is the only way I could describe my life that summer. But ever since I got back to LA, I've been on a constant search to find a comparable deli. Of course, nothing could perfectly replicate 'heaven.' But I did find Langer's. And in my opinion, it's probably 'nirvana.' Some would say that 'heaven' and 'nirvana' is basically the same place, but for the purposes of this review, let's just say that it's different. And yes, they are both equally AMAZING. That being said, I don't think Katz and Langer's should be ranked against each other. The way I see it, if you're in NY you should go to Katz. And when you're in LA you should go to Langer's. If you're in LA and you don't want to spent a few hundred bucks on a trip to NY, you can always go to Langer's. And that's basically my situation right now. \u00a0#19 is superb. I'll yield to the description of other reviewers for the sake of time. Somewhat pricey, yes. But if you think about it, it's about the same price as Canter's. So why would you ever go to Canter's when Langer's is infinitely better?The only qualm I have, although minor, is that they use pink lemonade for their Arnold Palmer. That to me is a no-no.

Langers, I really wanted to love you, but I refuse to go back.Let's start with the lousy overpriced \"deli\" food this establishment serves. I've been here more than once and been shocked at the lack of certain staples in the selection (e.g. black and white cookies). I've tried to enjoy the thin, overly salty broth with flavorless matzoh balls, but no luck. I've eaten it simply because I knew I was paying for it and I was hungry. The sandwiches, while generously sized are nothing to write home about. Nothing appears to be fresh as most items are either pre-frozen or from concentrate.Moving past the \"food\" this joint serves, let's talk about the crappy service. I came here for lunch today (for a friend's birthday) and waited about 40 minutes to be seated. When we were seated, we were given to adjoining booths, so the party was divided in half, yet still charged the obligatory 20% tip (not 18%) for a large group. Yet this alone would not have prompted me to write a review. What really killed me was the following incident. I needed to leave early from the lunch and went to the front to pay with a credit card. After fighting with multiple managers about paying for a cup of soup, they a) overcharged me; b) filled in the tip amount on my behalf on my credit card receipt; and c) told my group I didn't pay. In other words, management stole my $10 since they forced the rest of my group to pay in cash for the whole amount. See the scam? Beware of this restaurant!

You won't find pastrami more tender than this. It's the only good place in the nation that steams their pastrami as opposed to smoking it like everyone else. \u00a0Both are good options, and while smoking makes it last longer (Katz sells their meats that you can then ship as gifts), it detracts from the natural flavors of meat and spices which is ultimately what pastrami is all about. \u00a0But if you're in the East Coast around NYC, there is no better place than Katz. \u00a0That said, I repeat, Langer's is still the best. \u00a0Sorry New York, at least you guys still have pizza.When you look at the area Langer's sits at, it'll seem very sketch, especially when you're right by MacArthur Park. \u00a0That's alright though, I'd invite you to check out other deli's in NYC or LA and not see the same environment. \u00a0Once you walk in, it's got that classic simple deli atmosphere and decor that makes you feel like you've gone back in time to the 70s.As far as the food goes, I can't say much about the other stuff on their menu which I'm sure is great, but my first experience here was with a friend who suggested the Langer's #19. \u00a0This sandwich will change your life. \u00a0The combination of rye bread, cole slaw, Russian dressing, and thick slabs of pastrami is heavenly and amazingly tender. \u00a0The pastrami is so tender, it has to be cut in thick slabs with a knife rather than shaved otherwise it would just fall about . This is how it's supposed to be done. \u00a0 The pastrami comes out strong and bold, but is tempered by the tartness of the coleslaw and the savory flavors are balanced by the sweetness of the Russian dressing. \u00a0It's pretty pricey for just the sandwich ($15 + tax), but it''s well worth it, and you do get what you pay for. \u00a0I usually order one of those sandwiches to cover for lunch and dinner. \u00a0For what it's worth, it'll continue being my favorite place for pastrami, but I won't be going everyday lest I become too familiar with it to the point of disenchantment.Food: 5Service: 5Price: 4", "Date": "2012-09-16", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Ivon V.", "ReviewID": "UzGHvyXomA46FbmPxdVYsg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Over priced,it's not what it's hyped up to be.

I heard so much in the media of this deli that I finally had a chance to try it though I must admit their menu is overpriced comparing with the same in LA area.When I asked to get in line the people in charge /with their badges of Langer's on/ told me that the line was closed since they are tired and don't want to work till late.I said I'd heard in the news that the giveaway is till 9pm it didn't help. When I asked to go in and buy one I was followed by one of employee to make sure that I pay for the sandwich not to \"cheat\". I told him that I didn't appreciate him following me around while I'm waiting at the counter. \"If you behave like this I'll escort you out!\", he shouted at me.

If one person was not ready, she would just skip u without telling you that that was what she was going to do. she also really pushed her recommendations. one person ordered what she recommended because he was afraid that she was going to chew off his head. we had one person in our group that did not eat beef and after ordering her turkey club the waitress said \"you're not getting pastrami?\". service was not bad, just intimidating, but i think she wasn't trying to be intimidating. i guess she wanted everyone to be happy with what they got and wanted to be sure that everyone got what the place was famous for. service could of been a little better, but I've had worse before. and since the pastrami is yum, even though pricey for the quantity, I am giving this place 4 stars for the quality of the pastrami.", "Date": "2011-06-11", "Author_Location": "Brea, CA"}, {"Author": "Claudia A.", "ReviewID": "Ox0nkFBg1iIxJbCfFo4mSA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Langer's needs to change their name to Longer's because once you eat there, you keep longing for their food! \u00a0Seriously, this is the best pastrami I have ever tasted, bar none. \u00a0I had a #10 (Pastrami and swiss w/ Russian dressing) on Sourdough and I had to eat it slowly to savor every bite. \u00a0I am never the last one to finish food at a table and I was this time around. \u00a0I am still thinking of this sandwich one day later and definitely plan to go back.

I'm pretty disappointed. I came here with a friend (after explaining and apologizing to him because this place is overpriced, and I felt bad for making him take me here). I wanted to try the #19 (first time I went there I got the corned beef rueben and it was very good..still overpriced). I am not a mayo fan and because of that I think that's why I didn't like the #19. You get a huge serving of cole slaw on top of the sandwich and all I could taste was the Mayo. I was also disappointed with the quality of the pastrami. Some pieces were fatty and yummy and some were dry and overcooked. For a $15 sandwich I'd expect all the meat (and there was not an abundance of meat) to be equally and nicely cooked. I also dislike that you don't get a side item with the sandwich. $15 for a sandwich with 1 pickle and you can't throw in a scoop of potato salad or some fries? What does one scoop (in an industrial size of potato salad spread over hundreds of orders of sandwiches amount to?) 25 cents? 50 cents? Really? Is your bottom line so strict that you can make a plate look complete with a side for no extra charge? I'm an Accounting major at school. If you can't afford a scoop of potato salad with a $15 sandwich you've got some MAJOR problems with the expenses of running your restaurant.

Just erase any pastrami sandwich you've had before from your memory because not only is this better, it is incredibly different. The pastrami is very thick - not sliced thin like deli meat. It is also incredibly tender and litterally falls apart with each bite. If you were eating this with a knife and fork, you would only need a fork. Also, the fresh baked in-house rye bread is something to write home about. I'm not even a huge fan of rye and this bread is amazing. Langer's is also such a fun place to go because of the atmosphere. The servers have worked here for decades and have lots of stories and personality. The character of the place reflects a time completely different from the neighborhood outside. It is truly a gem. Also, if you are completely gluttonous make sure the get the chili cheese fries! Oh so greesy and good. This is definitely a place to take out-of-towners to.
