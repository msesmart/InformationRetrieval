It helps you make up your mind.$3 for a small soft taco is pretty high. And if you're a hungry guy (like my husband) you could easily be 10-12 tacos in before you actually start to feel full. But that means you're also $30-36 dollars in the hole. For one person. I know they're charging for the quality of ingredients, so perhaps this just needs to be a snack or light lunch for those of us who don't like leaving a place hungry.The pastor meat is amazing, brightened by pineapple. I asked for a side of it to go atop the Big Star salad, which ended up being a good-sized meal and very fresh.The guacamole was mediocre; you can get much better at Las Palmas up the road on North Ave or at Irazu on Milwaukee.My husband was raving about the chorizo tacos, and the tortillas are corn-based and scrumptious.If you like to \"be seen\" and talk very loudly to your dining companions, try to sit at a table. If you're like us and prefer actual conversation in peace, order your food from the to-go window and take it home, to a park, or sit at one of the picnic tables by the to-go window.", "Date": "2014-07-14", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Nathan L.", "ReviewID": "BwzK0EXpykNckgYe4lAveA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We tried this place after the nearby, the Violet Hour. \u00a0Big Star has an impressive outdoor seating section and an indoor area as well. \u00a0We were there on a Thursday night and it was packed! \u00a0We found a couple seats inside quickly. \u00a0It has a very cool tex-mex theme. \u00a0Everything was very clean and the staff was friendly, quick and helpful. \u00a0We ordered a few different tacos, the chips and guacamole and a pitcher of margaritas. \u00a0The margaritas were delicious and the tacos were amazing! \u00a0I tried a bite of a couple different tacos and all were just awesome. \u00a0The guac was fresh and tasty also. \u00a0The food was all reasonably priced.This place is very popular so I could see having to wait on a weekend. \u00a0The food was great and the drinks were strong. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place. \u00a0But keep in mind it is cash only. \u00a0It would probably be nice for a family earlier in the day.", "Date": "2014-07-13", "Author_Location": "Kalamazoo, MI"}, {"Author": "Rachael K.", "ReviewID": "kIa-eaV6LLuzpdldudPwxA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved it here and after reading reviews from people who gave this place 1 star, most were for ridiculous reasons. \u00a0I think this place deserves at least 4 stars. \u00a0The drinks were delicious and they have a wide variety of whiskey, tequila, and beer. \u00a0I thought the chips and guacamole were pretty awesome, also. \u00a0The meat in the tacos was well seasoned of the ones I tried, there were an assortment of different sauces and finishings. \u00a0The only thing I would change is that the fish taco was heavily battered but it still tasted delicious. \u00a0As for the atmosphere, although it had a bit of a hipster vibe, everyone was friendly, drinking, chilling, and not overly deuchey or rowdy. \u00a0I loved the outdoor seating, and although it gets crowded we didn't wait too long for a table. \u00a0Me gusta mucho, I would definitely come back and bring friends.And one more thing...pretty damn cheap! :)", "Date": "2014-07-10", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Lisa B.", "ReviewID": "isatxyR3nwJR8iUOrX_bjg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came in mid-day to celebrate (or recover from) our move.

THANK YOU! THANK YOU!You completely saved an otherwise awful Chicago restaurant day. We were in from out of town for a birthday celebration and in between visits to Longman & Eagle (they were crazy overwhelmed so our experience unfortunately suffered greatly) for brunch and Alinea for dinner when we popped into Violet Hour and were pointed across the street when we asked for a recommendation for something quick and fun to fill our bellies. After a great cocktail at VH we put our name on the 45 minute wait list (which ended up being SPOT on!) but we actually ended up sitting at the bar when some seats conveniently opened up. There is nothing in this world that I love more than a restaurant that knows what they do and do it well. The experience is indescribable for me, it just seems perfect. No fluff, no bullshit, just pure authenticity and hospitality. Your staff was full of aces, all working extremely hard and with each other to provide a great experience. We enjoyed a few Micheladas, several tacos and the scrumptious, cheesy, oily and DELICIOUS queso fundido while admiring the bar staff busting their asses with smiles on their faces and laughs in the air. Lively, delicious, affordable, fun, relaxing, vibrant, blah blah blah.... just fucking go and ENJOY! Thank you to all of you for a seriously great experience.

We ventured down here on a Saturday afternoon that was full of sunshine and summer vibes. We knew there would be a wait so we put our name on the list and perused the many shops near by. I expected the wait to be a lot longer but within 30 minutes we were seated at a table on the patio. While I know waiting can be annoying I think the advantage here is that there is enough in the neighborhood to keep you occupied while you wait. Once seated we needed a few minutes to browse the drinks menu and when our server swung back through for the second time we grabbed 2 gumball heads and ordered chips and guac. So so so so soooooo yummy! I can't say why I thought it was so good, I've eaten guacamole all over the country and in Mexico but this really hit the spot. We took our time enjoying the sunshine, beers and appetizer. When we were ready we ordered three tacos each. I enjoyed the taco al pastor (delicious! the pineapple was perfection with it and it's one of the best pastor tacos I've had in a while), the taco de panza (perfectly cooked pork belly and the sauce that was on it was so damn good!) as well as the taco de pescado (this was seriously one the top 3 fish tacos I've had. I don't usually do beer battered fish tacos but it was amazing.) I can't wait to come back here this summer, the food was delicious and the beers were cold. I will agree with most of the comments about the staff. They were kind of a pain in the ass. Pretentious and seemingly either annoyed about the fact that they're at work or just annoyed with people in general. I get annoyed with people in general too but when you're job involves dealing with people I think you should at least pretend to be happy about being at work. Maybe that's just me.

On to the food...I am Mexican and from So Cal so I'm pretty picky about my tacos, lol. I ended up ordering a taco de pescado(fish) and a taco de Panza(pork belly) with some chips and guac. The pork belly taco was good, but the fish taco was whatever. nothing to rave about. The batter on the fish taco was too heavy. fried fish tacos should have a light batter so you're not eating a bunch of grease and you should also be able to taste the fish, but it was a big piece of fish for a street taco so I'll give them that. The guacamole was good and pretty authentic...hey some people can screw up guacamole, but this place didn't!

Maybe a 4.5 if you want to nitpick. I only have a few minor issues (after about 15 trips): One, it's always insanely loud inside. I don't expect to eat in silence - or anything close to it - but if I have to strain to hear the person sitting next to me, we've got problems. And two, what's with the ID nazis at the door? I once ordered at the take-out window and was asked to pick up my order inside. When I tried to go in, the door guy stopped me and asked to see my ID. I explained that I was simply going inside to pick up an order, and he said it didn't matter. He still needed to see my ID.Okay...Are you a bar, or are you a restaurant? I'm 28, so it didn't matter. It was just annoying. Kudos for curbing underage drinking, I guess, but I once saw the door guy card - and let in - someone who was under 21. And this was around 9 p.m. So if you're going to let underage people in, why are you carding? Or at least carding so stringently? Luckily, I rarely encounter either of these issues (the noise and the nazis) because I'm about a 10-minute walk from Big Star, so I almost always order to go. The food is insanely good, but the in-restaurant dining experience leaves a little to be desired. I repeat: The food is insanely good.

sometimes just for drinks, sometimes for a quick gorge, sometimes for a lengthy splurge; sometimes by day, sometimes by night; sometimes at a packed Friday-night peak, sometimes on a frigid, snow-burdened late Tuesday afternoon; mostly at the bar, sometimes on the patio, rarely in a booth, and often milling about a bit before my group scoops some seats.All of this is simply (a) to express that this review is the product of a very longitudinal experience with Big Star and (b) to illustrate a point about this bar, specifically, and maybe also something generally about reviews.After the first ten or so times (over the first year-and-a-half post-opening), I would have begrudgingly awarded Big Star three stars, and in my heart would have felt something between two and three more appropriate. \u00a0But I kept going--because I had friends who really loved the place, and because there *were* a few things I thought Big Star did exceptionally well (namely the de pescado and de panza tacos).And I kept going. \u00a0Over the course of another ten or so visits (maybe roughly the next year-and-a-half of operation), I began to regard Big Star--subtly and through a gnawing process of growing appreciation--as a solidly four-star establishment. \u00a0The margaritas--especially the Big Star Margarita, with its dose of mezcal--began to settle into a delicious, damn-dependable drink; the weekly carousel of three-dollar whiskey shots seemed to harmonize with my needs on any given night; the draught selection became much more well-curated, variable, and locally-sourced; I developed a keen taste for micheladas; they continued to refine and innovate their cocktail and food offerings.Now--a bit over four years into their operation--I consider Big Star indispensable. \u00a0It's place I actively crave at arbitrary moments, or after long spells of not patronizing, or when I'm drinking tequila at a less-satisfying bar in another city. \u00a0And in these instances, I covet not just what it purveys, but what it is; I don't just want to eat that great beet tostada from the autumn menu, or try that Quarter Mile Manhattan I haven't got around to sampling yet: more nebulously, I just want to haunt one of its counters or corners for an hour or three.But you *must* know when to go, and what to expect--and what you can tolerate--given the time you're choosing to go: a chilly Tuesday afternoon in late November is a great time to grab an immediate stool, while a Friday night at 8:00 is a great time to ensure you'll wait in cramped (but hopefully liquored) discomfort; and if it's the first warm, sunny, patio-perfect day of the year ... well you're probably better off waiting for another weekend, because everyone else has that same idea, too.Personally, a sleepy mid-December Sunday evening, snow landing lush on the large windows, twinkling strings of light glazing the wood and white paint with a limpid-crystal warmth, a shot of Overholt in one mitt and a pint of Gumball Head in the other, a couple tacos down the hatch and a couple more en route ... let's just say sometimes it takes a spell to develop things, be they restaurants, reviews, or one's personal little reveries and idylls.", "Date": "2014-01-29", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Angela L.", "ReviewID": "KeAOdmy66KB0UdhKOf0L5w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Short review: \u00a0Big Star is AWESOME.That sums it up, but if you want to know more details, you can keep reading.I've been coming here for years and it is always a great experience. \u00a0I've had many of my friends compare Big Star to bars that you'd find in Texas. \u00a0I've never been to Texas, so I will take their word for it.It's best to go in the summer because they have that great patio. \u00a0They have a lot of great cocktails, and I like to try something different every time I go. \u00a0The cocktails are more on the dry side, something I strongly prefer over very sweet drinks. \u00a0They have a really good variety of bourbons and tequilas.Order up some guac and a variety of tacos, and you are set for the night. \u00a0You order \"by the taco\", so you'll only get one of something unless you specify for more, but no worries. \u00a0They stuff the tortillas so that they are overflowing with deliciousness, and definitely worth the price.

Finally \u00a0they let her through to the hostess who then told her she couldn't sit there because there was no seat, but there was. It was quite off-putting. Eventually her friends got the waiter to come and get her. This was probably the worst part of the experience, it gets better from here.We got in and put our name down for 2, then went to the bar for some margaritas...when I say some I mean 1 pitcher - and then another from our new friends at the bar (I think you can see where this is going...)

If you've ever visited my hometown, you will know what aholes people can be. They're rude, swanky lifestyle is a must, and if you don't look a certain way you are definitely not getting into the hottest club on South Beach. Well, I didn't know a RESTAURANT could be so discriminatory like the South Beach nightclubs until this past Saturday night. Let me give you the low down:My friends have been raving about this place the whole month I've lived here. I was dying to try their tacos! We had gone out to a few bars in the area and decided to give it a shot as a \"food coma after party.\" Fast forward to us being in the restaurant. It was packed. We put our name on the \"list.\" The male hostess, which now I am convinced was pretending to be a bouncer at a hot nightclub, did not keep a list per say. He just said, \"how many are you?\" We responded, \"three.\" He said it'd be a few minutes. We thought, \"no big deal. We'll wait.\" Well, tick tock tick tock TICK TOCK. Approximately half an hour later, if not more, there were about 5-6 empty tables. Since then, I had already personally went up to the male hostess and asked him what the deal was. Why was it taking so long? He kept telling me we had to wait and that was that. So here's when his true colors came out. Full disclaimer: I consider myself a pretty good looking girl, I'm not conceited or anything, but if you see pics, you know I am not at all ugly. I was dressed in jeans, a long sleeve blouse, and since it was cold, I kept my coat on during the long wait. Well, here comes a group of half naked girls walking in as if they own the joint. They open the door, say hi to the \"hostess\", and get a table immediately. WOW! Are you kidding me, guy? I was in awe. We tried to sit at one of the other empty tables (one of the ones the promiscuous girls did not snatch from us) and were told that was not allowed. So I personally went up to the male hostess once again and asked him his name. Let me just tell you: he thought about his name for a solid 10 seconds so I'm assuming it wasn't his real name and he didn't give a rats butt if he threw a coworker under the bus. The name I was given was Peter. Was it Peter? I don't know. But I will give you a full description of the discriminatory male hostess so that people who walk in and see this guy, can immediately avoid the place like the plague if he is there. Or so that MANAGEMENT (the people who should be reading these reviews and should want to make these awful situations better) will do something regarding this insanity. He was a tall, black guy, not super dark skin, but a lighter black complexion. He did have an oddly shaped head (sorry to say) and was bald. Please, for the love of God, Big Star. Do something about his discriminatory actions. Sorry I wasn't dressed to his expectations. Maybe if I was, we would've gotten a table, I would've fallen in love with your tacos, you would've had a new, devoted customer, and my friends would've continued dining at your establishment.

I told my whole family and many friends too. I also told a lot of strangers on the public way. For instance I would be at the grocery store and would strike up conversation with strangers just to tell them about the amazing and adorable Tilapia fish taco.Then suddenly, the inevitable happened. It was sudden and without notice. I went to Big Star for a regular routine order of 6-8 Tilapia fish tacos. I just called them \"fish tacos\" to the waitress because they always knew what I meant. When I got the tacos I knew instantly that these weren't the same. They looked dried up and strange. My first bite was horrible. It turned out that they changed the type of fish in the taco. It is no longer tilapia but CATFISH......yea I said it... That's disgusting. It's also a cheaper fish. I instantly felt like vomiting when I made this discovery.....Also customer service has gone down hill...... Enough said..... So sad*I am adding some more information to this review. Since I wrote all of the above, Big Star has contacted me and assured me that the tilapia fish taco is back. I changed the one star rating to three based on this information. I'm going to give them another chance and if the tilapia fish taco is back to what it was then I will rate this place a four. The next thing I'm hoping for is the quality in customer service to return as well. If that happens then this place will be a five in my book. I will keep yelp updated on my next experience at the Big Star....**I have decided to add even more information about my experience with this place and this may be my final update. Well the tilapia fish taco is back on the menu. No more nasty catfish. However the tilapia fish taco has not seemed to have been restored to its original state. I would have given the original tilapia fish taco 5 stars. The ones they have put back on the menu are like 3 and 1/2 stars. It seems as though either A. They have a new vender for the tilapia fish or B. The tilapia is cooked differently. Whatever it is it's just not the same. They are also very stingy with the chipotle mayo sauce that they use on these tacos now. Why fix something that's not broken??? To top it all off they have raised the price of the fish taco by $1. The okay tilapia fish tacos are now $4.I feel somewhat betrayed by bigstar nonetheless we seem to have a love/hate relationship so I will be back again and again and again.

This particular night, we tried the chips + guac, al pastor, chicken, fish, and potato. \u00a0My favorite, by far, was the al pastor- the grilled pineapple sweetness complemented the well marinated pork just right. It also helped that the taco was absolutely heaping when served!The chicken, fish and potato were all fine (I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken, to be completely honest) and the chips + guac were actually quite good. The chips were thin, warm, and crunchy (with a little extra salt) and the guac was as good as I've had elsewhere. \u00a0Just wish that for $8, there had been more guac to chip ratio.Prices are a little high- $3-4 for one of most tacos, sometimes a bit higher than that even.

This queso deserves to be the only queso in the dictionary. Taco Al Pastor - Marinated, spit roasted pork shoulder with grilled pineapple, onions and cilantro - It was my second time eating pork shoulder in 36 hours and man I could have done it again and again. Tacos de Papas con Rojas - Potatoes rajas chipotle, queso cotija, onions, cilantro - Going meat-free was my attempt at eating one \"healthy\" thing for the entire vacation. The little cubed potatoes crumbled with the piecey cojita cheese very nicely. EHHH:Sonoran Hot Dog - Bacon wrapped, pinto beans, lime mayo, mustard, onions, big star hot sauce on a bolillo roll - This hot dog was so spicy that I started sweating... and it takes a lot (Bikram yoga) to make me sweat.

I don't care who you are and where you work... you don't seat a table and not greet them within 20 minutes.

Big Star's huge front patio and lack of a front door are more common in warm-weather climates, so to feel as though briefly transported there is incredibly appealing when seeking a fun dining experience.The menu is tacos, straight up, with some chip and dip sides/appetizers. There staples and things change time to time, but there aren't tons of options. If you want choices, go to any other Mexican restaurant. Here, you choose between 6-7 different tacos that you order individually, which is great if you want a taco snack, don't want to fill up or just want to have extra money to spend on drinks or appetizers.On the menu, I personally like the Taco Al Pastor, and the Walking Taco is a tortilla-less taco served in a bag of Fritos, which is both tasty and highly amusing. Vegetarians who eat fish will have some choices here as well (read: fish taco, but there are others), which you might not expect with a limited menu. Chips and guac and queso fundido are also delicious.In terms of drinks, Big Star stands out for its extensive bourbon list, but there are some great cocktails (from the looks of it, I've never tried any) and the beer menu has both craft beers and Mexican-style lagers (though mostly in bottles or cans -- the tap selection is small). This isn't a place where you see everyone drinking the margaritas just because hey, it's Mexican-style food.Big Star is open late, like any place that serves this kind of food should be. You can also order tacos at a walk-up window, so if you just want to taste stuff and avoid the long wait for a table, you can.The full package of food and atmosphere makes Big Star a total standout in Chicago.

The fish taco is probably my favorite. There's a generous portion of fried fish filet, some slaw and a great chipotle/mayonnaise-y sauce. In terms of whisky, the pricing seems nonsensical. Some of the crappier booze will cost more per shot than some of the better stuff. And in the end, you're better off from a money-strandpoint heading to Binny's and buying a bottle.

I am writing a 2 star review for Big Star. This place has gone downhill and definitely lost the 'cool factor'. The crowd has turned into a Lincoln Park/Wrigleyville hybrid group. Lots of bros, guys who eagerly describe themselves as a 'young professional', and older people who have gotten a babysitter for the night who just 'really want to let loose'. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is a departure from what Big Star used to be. It also is kind of depressing watching a 40 something year old mom fall on the floor at 10pm on a Wednesday because she has had too many margaritas. Since this place is in my neighborhood \u00a0I used to come here all the time, sometimes alone. It used to have a community feel where everyone at the bar would chat and drink together. Now I would never go here alone because as a woman I am CONSTANTLY bothered here with \"Hey beautiful, do you come here often?\" type BS. I know, I know, it's a bar and that happens at bars. However it seems like Big Star has become one of the worst places in that respect, at least in this area. It didn't used to be like that. It is definitely better during the winter months, but it still isn't great. The other night my friend and I were shocked by how rude the bartenders were. After coming here for years we both agreed--- we have NEVER had a service experience at Big Star that we can remember being positive. It seems it is more important for the servers/bartenders to look cool than to actually be friendly, positive and engaging. There is a lot of mediocrity accepted here. The 'too cool for school' attitude is getting really, really old. Most of us in the neighborhood have lots of tattoos and skinny jeans too, that doesn't mean you have to be an asshole because you're edgier than everyone else. You're not. Stop it. Smile for once. Play nice.The food is good but now that Antique Taco is down the street I'd much rather go there.

After a while, the *same* window opens (despite having a pickup window with no line in front of it) and they start calling numbers. So we have to push our way back into the same crowd at the front of the line, with the frat boys acting like we're cutting, and trying to get our food along with the other 3 parties called back.

Could've used less, as the pork belly was so tender and succulent in itself. The corn tortillas were warm and soft, not once falling apart in my hands or mouth. The juices dripped freely, which made the cheese so intoxicating. A little cilantro went underneath the cheese, giving it a freshly green flavor. The limes from the Tecates actually greatly enhanced the flavoring, making me wonder why limes are ALWAYS used?! It's almost like garlic.

So I got the Taco de Panza (pork belly), Taco de Pescado (tilapia), and the Taco al Pastor (pork shoulder). The pork belly was described as crispy. Mine was not crispy.

I like that they add pineapple since traditional al pastor tacos don't have pineapple. Guacamole. What is all the hype? This was truly the worst chips and guac I've ever had. The chips seemed stale. The guac was fizzy and limey like they put too much stuff to preserve it from turning brown. I'd honestly rather have slightly brown tasty guac that this nasty stuff. I just want fresh guac. Is that too much to ask for? I know you're always packed, but the quality of food should not suffer for it. We also ordered the horchata and the housemade limeade. Seemed watered down.

Not that I need you to kiss my ass but you don't need an attitude.Service \"2 stars\": Our server seemed annoyed answering our questions. She did however recommend a good margarita. Speaking of the margarita, would it have pained them to fill the glass? I'm not a lush but it was filled a solid inch below the rim which means that at least two employees knew it was not filled properly (the bartender and food runner.) When we asked for our check the server walked past several times without dropping it off. No a big deal until we realize she's over chatting with the aforementioned hosts.Food \"4 stars\" overall: Salsa de frijol con queso \"3 stars\" - This was a pork, tomato, and onion dip topped with cheese and served with tortilla chips. It was good, not great. It had a decent flavor and wasn't overly spicy. My friend described it as something you could get at Taco Bell. I happen to like Taco Bell and I have to agree.Taco de papas con rajas \"3 stars\" - This taco contained potatoes, green chilies, cheese, onion and cilantro. Great flavor and absolutely nothing like Taco Bell! This taco was a bit on the spicy side but not overwhelming. I would recommend it but actually want to try some others next time.Taco de pescado \"5 stars\" - I did not have this but my lunch mate said it was the best fish taco she has ever had, maybe she will post her own review with more detail. She also had another taco which she didn't comment on.I can't remember the name of my margarita but it was amazing! It had several flavors including cucumber that blended together perfectly for a summer drink. Very refreshing and I would go back just to have another.

Any time I have visitors come to Chicago, this is one of the first places I think of bringing them, as we can enjoy great food, drinks, and music - the visitors I bring here are never disappointed. First, the food:Taco de Panza - my personal favorite. The pork belly is marinated perfectly and delicious. Queso fresco and onion are good toppings.Pastor Taco - delicious as well, juicier than the Panza, and also sweeter due to the bits of pineapple.Rajas Taco - the \"meat\" of this taco is potato that is spiced very nicely. The spices are hot, and this is one of the heavier tacos, but I love it. I don't think this one would be for everybody.Pollo Taco - fall-apart chicken stewed in a creamy tomatillo/poblano sauce, topped with picked onion. Taste is more subtle, but this one is also quite good.Guacamole with chips - delicious, creamy, heavy on the lime. Tortillas are warm, crunchy, and nicely salted. We almost always start with this.Queso Fundido - melted chihuahua cheese with poblano peppers and chorizo mixed in. A very unhealthy item, but it is also very delicious (the usual relationship). Chorizo and cheese are strong flavors that manage to work very well together.Walking Taco - not that good. A bag of Fritos with refried beans and a big handful of shredded cheese thrown in there. Very cheap at $2, but it felt like I was handed a chip bag that mostly contained shredded cheese.Getting a table - not easy. At peak times, at least a 1.5 hour wait. If you're lucky, you can get a few seats at the bar, or eat at a barrel. This is unfortunate, but the place is very popular, so not much can be done about this.Service - surprisingly good for such a busy place. Wherever you choose to sit or stand, a server will be with you to take your order for food or drinks. They seem to run a very efficient operation. The cash only policy should be changed.Drinks - good deals on beer and whiskey ($5 for beer and shot, for example). Excellent selection of whiskey, small but decent selection of draft beer. Margaritas also very good.Overall, an excellent place to go with friends for delicious food and a great selection of drinks. 5 stars.", "Date": "2013-09-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Todd L.", "ReviewID": "HPCh7c3n2N0pV-IfVUUyyA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of my favorite Chicago restaurants.

The dulce de leche milkshake can be nice and creamy one week to icey and cheap tasting the next. You may have a taco with some ingredients missing from when you had it before.

More so, I think I have some idea of what to expect in a \"gringo\" sort of Mexican restaurant (not enough Norte\u00f1o). \u00a0Things I don't typically see: bizarre salsas (which are rather bland hot sauces in squeeze bottles), very little tequila, and a weird look when I asked for a Chelada. \u00a0No matter, I'm perfectly happy with a Lone Star (and the bartender was shocked when I asked for the cap) and the whiskey special that day, the acceptable (and nothing more) light spice of Old Overholt.I say \"light spice\" as a rather poor way of foreshadowing all of the food at Big Star: not spicy. \u00a0Again, with my extensive taco experience (I've had at least two \"Taco Supremes\") I was a bit disappointed with my $4 a pop al pastor tacos. \u00a0First off, \u00a0I have read the origin story of Big Star (Mr Pedro Ordonez) and how he came from the DF (Mexico City) and missed the taste of a genuine Al Pastor taco when he was in med school, so he opened up Big Star. \u00a0Well he really must have missed it because these tacos taste nothing like Al Pastor tacos I've bought for change in Mexico, from late night windows in Denver and LA, and generally in any city or place in or near Mexico. Maybe he's marinating the meat okay (meh, I couldn't taste the guajillo if it was there), but usually the pineapples you get on your Al Pastor don't taste like the one it was cooked with. \u00a0Usually you get fresh onions and some cabbage (not on these puppies). \u00a0And in the DF and anywhere else that actual ex-pat Mexicans live in droves, you're going to get them on corn tortillas. \u00a0(If you're going to use flour tortillas at least use the kind made with lard, not the ones that yuppies smear Nutella on... I am one of those yuppies, FWIW.)But Big Star is a rebel and assumes you know nothing about tacos (they don't either). \u00a0Big Star with their bland sauces (what about some El Yucateco Habenero? \u00a0That stuff is a dollar from a bodega in any Southwest city), gross salsa, and crowds of faux-hipsters and old dudes in pony tails. \u00a0Big Star with the poor service and blah atmosphere.Oh well. \u00a0I guess if you're in Chicago and you must have a taco... you should drive out to Lawndale because these tacos suck.", "Date": "2013-01-21", "Author_Location": "Denver, CO"}, {"Author": "Anne S.", "ReviewID": "086jgVLqBzUv0QEhP5d8gg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Big Star is very popular, and I think it is for good reasons. \u00a0The place has good food, good drinks, and good service. \u00a0As far as I'm concerned that makes a great restaurant.I came here at 6pm tonight (Saturday) for a birthday dinner with 8 girls. \u00a0I was surprised that there was already an 1.5 hour wait at 6pm, and that they were at capacity.It didn't take us very long to get inside, where we were able to stand around the bar drinking until our table was ready. \u00a0The bartender was quick with drinks.There are large booths here, which was good since we had a large group. \u00a0We fit all 8 of us snugly in the booth.I may be too old for places like this because I thought it was too loud. \u00a0We ordered chips and guacamole and plantains as appetizers. \u00a0The guac was very good. \u00a0I wasn't a fan of the plantains, but I only like sweet plantains not fried ones, so that is not Big Star's fault.Our server seriously had her shit together. \u00a0She didn't even blink an eye when at least 4 of us ordered food without dairy. \u00a0(And even more amazing, when I ordered the potato taco with no cheese and the fish taco, she told me there was mayo on the fish taco and asked if I wanted it without mayo. \u00a0I love when servers catch hidden dairy in things and let me know. \u00a0It means they are awesome).While the server did a fabulous job taking our order, the delivery of the food is a bit odd. \u00a0They bring out all of the similar tacos on the same plate, rather than bringing each person a plate with their food. \u00a0That was a bit harder for us since we had 1 vegan at the table, 1 person who doesn't eat dairy or pork, 2 that don't eat dairy but eat all meat, and 4 that eat everything. \u00a0Our orders were obviously a giant pain in the ass. \u00a0It would have been a whole lot easier if the orders were served as ordered. \u00a0But then again, maybe most people aren't as difficult as I am. \u00a0But it was annoying because I ate a pork taco thinking it was a potato taco.The guacamole and the fish taco were my favorite. \u00a0Someone else had the beet tostado and loved that. \u00a0I wish I had ordered that because it looked really good.They have Mexican coke and Mexican fresca. \u00a0Mexican freca is awesome, everyone should try it!Warnings:Cash Only (they have an ATM inside)It's dark insideIt's loud inside", "Date": "2013-02-23", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Melina D.", "ReviewID": "u7zxStHUvuT2gfjPD3lbhw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do you like waiting 50 minutes for a table and paying twice as much for mediocre Mexican food?

That is the first of my nit-picky complaints for this wicker park tex-mex joint. The ambiance is great, especially for a hot summer day in Chicago. You have ample outdoor dinning space and they are very dog friendly. I even think they violate a few city codes allowing you to eat in the outdoor patio with your dog under the table. If all you want is a fun cool place to spend a summer afternoon/happy hour Big Star is one of the best places in wicker park. The staff is great and the location is awesome.But food counts and a hate to say I was unimpressed. I had their fish and chicken tacos. The chicken was the best, but the fish tacos (that were beer battered, baja style) were to dry and so thinly battered you could barely taste it. We ordered some chips and salsa and they brought us a plate mediocre chips. I ask were the sals was and the waitress pointed to two ketchup style squeeze bottles baking in the sun on our table (that was $3 bucks). So they skimped on the chips, but not on the margarita. We ordered a pitcher and half way through my first glass I had a strong buzz. Now I'm not a lightweight, but these things were strong; too strong to be honest. When I slowed down to actually taste it, it was apparent the concoction was about 40% tequila. We ordered more food just to soak up the booze and I'm glad we did, because the queso fundio turned out to be the best thing we ate.Big Star isn't bad, it's just not great. You'll wind up waiting at least 50 minutes for a table on a nice weekend, but if you come here, you're not coming for the food.

If they are, skip ahead of them (politely), and present your ID to the doorman/woman, and ask to go to the bar. You can usually go right in if you're not trying to get a table. There, you just saved 15 minutes standing behind Buffy and Stacey. 3. When you go inside, go immediately to the back of the bar...all the way back by the bathrooms. Order your first drink here, probably while standing, because the bar is usually fully occupied.4. Now you can stalk for a seat to open at the bar. If you see someone handling cash, they're paying their bill. Politely ask them for \"dibs\" on their seat. 5. They get up, you sit down. Ask for a food menu, get another drink.

Picture this as a monologue, perhaps a rant or just a great speech by an evil villain/ epic hero:Big Star tells us it will be two hours. Yep, it's a gorgeous 60 degree friday alright. Of course they have their typical two hour wait. We decide to have fun with the shops on Damen and get some cash to fulfill their needless cash-only policy. We stop in a bunch of stores, come back an hour and a half later, only to be sneered at by the silly young hostess. Merlot socks though, and that's the color of fall. So she had one thing right. Merlot is the \"it\" color. The It color aside, she smiles viciously and tells me that it is going to be an exponential amount of time until we are seated and she can't even think how long it will be, but it's not the two hours she told me. She suggested that we have drinks at the bar while we wait for that unknown period of time it will take to get a table. I said that we wanted to eat and the bar wouldn't cut it, but then she just smiled and said nothing. I felt like she had told me to go screw myself, but I just thank her and walk away to discuss it with my buddy.I don't know who waits around for 4 hours to eat $3 tacos, but I can be sure that Big Star is trying to give off the same vibe its' owners' other establishment has. Well, Yelpers, Big Star is certainly not Violet hour and not even close to deserving the same discerning attitude. You can find better tacos and margaritas at 5 places less than a mile away in that area. So Big Star, give up the 'tude. You are not Violet Hour and never will be, and your popularity will fade. Unless of course, Big Star turns into an \"I Robot\"-style plan and tries to kill us all. Believe me, the hostess' \u00a0condescending smile certainly could have.

The tableside duo of salsas (go green!) thankfully rounds things out perfectly and brings positively no shortage of kick to the party.

The pick-up window is key for these excursions, but if you can, get in and sit down because the menu doubles. Meaning there are now 13 items to choose from. Of these I highly recommend: Tamales Verzcruz: This is a seasonal item that is not always available, but it is now, so come in and get it, it is sublime. Sonoran hot dog - bolillo roll, big star hot sauce, pinto beans, lime mayo, yes. Please. Thank you. The server was all, \"Its pretty substantial!.\" I then pulled up my shirt and shoved my thumb in my bellybutton and exclaimed, \"So is this, lady!\" This item is a real treat and they wrap it in bacon in case you have second thoughts. Tacos al pastor - Must get, with the pineapple it plays wonderfully. Tostada de pollo - cilantro pesto, queso crema, another must get, this is a staple. Drinks:La paloma - This is freaking awesome, and it is pinkish in color so you know it is super manly. They hide the tequila well. But I do not. Classic margarita - Nice and smooth. Tons of sea salt on the rim. Michelada - Mexican cerveza preparada made with beer, lime juice, tomato juice (or Clamato) and hot sauce, get this if you have no fear and want to get properly toasted. Everything I recommend above minus the Michelada and tip is $38. You can't beat that.After eating and drinking many tequila drinks that have made me forget the horrors of the week, I take my daughters hand and saunter over to wicker park, where I can bask in the unseasonably warm sun and enjoy a few fleeting moments of uninterrupted half sleep time while I allow the juices to marinate in my belly. This place truly is an embodiement of wicker park, supplying the bad and the good, while still allowing you to feel like you're doing something when just lazily lying in a sunbeam after stuffing your face with pork and liquor on a Friday.

First hurdle: There is an entrance, but it's unmarked and you will drive/walk past it several times before you figure out that the drab, grey garage is actually the place raved about in the New York Times.OK, you've made it inside. Next hurdle: It's a restaurant, but you have to sit around a bar. Wait, there are tables, but oh, you can't sit in them unless you have a larger party. Oh wait, small parties can sit in them, but only if it's after a certain hour.Alright, you've decided you can deal with sitting at the bar. Hurdle #3: There is a host, but oh wait, they won't seat you, they'll just explain that you have to hover around the people eating at the bar until someone gives up their seat. And there's no priority system, so you either have to watch your fellow hover-ers like a hawk, or stake your claim to an area and pray they leave as soon as they're done eating. Hurdle #4: Cash only. Obnoxious, considering this is not a Mom-n-Pop kind of place that can't afford a credit card machine.Final hurdle: The servers don't write down your order. I cannot fathom why places do this. Especially at a place like this, where the menu encourages you to order a lot of small items. It inevitably leads to a screw up, which is exactly what happened. We ended up getting two of something we only wanted one of, and none of something else. There is a very easy fix for this: FUCKING WRITE IT DOWN.If you can get past the foregoing barriers to enjoyment, you will probably find that you like Big Star. A lot. For one very good reason: The tacos are tasty little bastards. Fresh tortillas, piled high with delicious carnitas, pescado, pork belly, ect. Add in just the right amount of guac, cilantro, and/or pico. And, most critically, a lime wedge. Top them off with one of the three salsas set at each station. Yum.

Sip it while taking in the converted garage decor, and by decor, I mean the light fixtures above the bar. Sparse, but awesome.Despite the excellent food and drink, I can't give Big Star more than three stars due to the aforementioned set up issues.

If however, you're looking for a Mexican meal that approximates the flavors and abundance of authentic cuisine, I suggest literally any other restaurant you can find. On a Thursday evening I found the staff to be immensely snobby about the prospect of seating me. I was carded before they let me put my name down on a table, even though my stated purpose was dinner. The hostess graciously allowed me to put my name down with only a cluck of her tongue and we waited (and waited). While we didn't expect immediate seating with no reservations, I didn't expect to be treated like a pest to my hostess, who after calling me for my table, told me I didn't have enough in my party to take our seats. She told me I was lucky that none of the other parties of 5 had shown up, because if my party arrived I could then sit down. Not a few moments later the remainder of my party arrived. When I approached the hostess stand, she gave me the dreaded no-look \u00a0\"just one second\" finger so that she could continue her apparently delightful conversation with another employee. After we were seated, we waited about 20 minutes just for the waitress to pull menus out of the bench next to us. Another long wait for the drink order, and another one for the main order, they must be advocates of the slow food movement.The atmosphere can be charitably described as immensely loud, I'm not sure Glenn Beck could be heard over the blaring music, but I might prefer his voice to the audiological assault of music.The chips were really great, as were the roasted pork belly tacos. Both nailed their mark, but at 3 dollars for chips with no salsa but those at our table, and 3 dollars per taco, it was more like expensive tapas than a true Mexican meal. \u00a0However, nothing else about this place justified the high price and generally intolerable dining experience. I am of the opinion that any establishment should act as though they welcome each patron and the business they bring. I am told that this place specifically employs a smug attitude to give the appearance of exclusivity, which is also used in other establishments run by the same proprietors. My thoughts on the matter are, if someone wants to pay significantly higher prices for Mexican food that has but some of the flavor and none of the spirit, then by all means, it's a free country.

Trifecta!I wondered over just before 4pm, staff was having their final evening meeting so I shivered and waiting outside. Ahhh, it was fine, I could email in peace. Upon entering you feel you are at more of a bar than a taco place, good reason since the drink menu is twenty times the size of the food menu. Sadly, since I was returning to work, food was only on my mind, a drink or three will have to wait for another day. The bartender was nice, friendly and helpful with the few questions I had. As I sipped my lime aid, (tasty and refreshing even on a chilly winter day), I pondered the menu. I knew the tacos weren't huge, but I decided to go for three and tostada and start there. I am sure if I needed more, I could go for another round. IF I liked them. One lamb, chicken and al pastor taco and a chicken tostada please. Oh, serrano chilies? Yes, please. I needs to warm myself up!Shortly after about five minutes, out popped the food and damn, small. \u00a0Well for me small. Like three bites small. But some wonderful things are in those three bites. The lamb braised in a spicy broth, lovely and flavorful. The toppings a slight overwhelming, but really when blended well in a good size mouthful, it just presents heaven on a tortilla. The al pastor was good, the pineapple I have had with it before, but really it helped to balance the heat from my serrano laden taco. Superb. The chicken, although what many would considered ordinary, was quite a distance from it and neither was the chicken tostada. Loved every bite. In fact had to go for another round of three tacos. Yes, the if can go away, I liked them.Honestly I could have had a few more rounds of everything. More of the tacos, more of the tostadas, try some of the queso fundido. Seriously, I know I have an appetite but I didn't want to seem that hungry. Also, look and ask about the specials. A regular had gotten a treat, who shared some with me, plantain fries. Loaded. Plantains. Love. *Swoon*But the nice thing is, its fairly cheap. Tacos are $2 to $3 each, tostadas are not much more.

There is still plenty of outdoor seating on that side, but if you're looking to enjoy a margarita w/ your tacos then you gotta wait. I really like the food here though! The taco al pastor is super delicioso..the pork is marinated really nicely & its also topped w/ grilled pineapple. I also ordered the Ensalada de Big Star & I didn't realize that it was such a large portion w/ lots of greens, cucumbers, pumpkin seeds & chile ranch dressing. It's definitely big enough to share w/ someone. I love the chips & guacamole here too..they make the guacamole & the chips have a nice hint of lime to it as well. I didn't really mind that we couldn't order drinks at that side b/c I was feeling like having a refresco anyway. They have the old school glass bottles of coke & also serve Jarritos and Horchata of course. Ooh & they even have popsicles too..I had the rice it was a little different but still pretty tasty & perfect for a summer night.FYI: Cash only @ the windowI've been inside before too but only for drinks & the margaritas were A-OK, we were lucky enough to get in w/o waiting long..but I definitely would not wait if there were 40 groups ahead of me.

It's owned by the same gangsters that own Violet Hour across the street. They're probably laundering money through the place, but who cares?Yes, the system is very unorganized. But the general concept, though somewhat skewed and random, is well thought out and, for the most part, well executed. For the best experience, go in late on a Sunday or Monday night. Forget the weekends for now because all you're going to do is get pissed off at all the people posturing and drawing attention to themselves. Why do you think the staff is cranky? Hmm???You know by now that Big Star is not trying, by any stretch of the imagination, to be an authentic taco joint. This bothers a lot of people for some reason. I don't know why. From any street corner in Chicago, you can throw a rock and hit at least 3 other \"authentic\" Mexican places, all of which serve up the same greasy, thrown-together food with ingredients of questionable origin. Who needs another one of those? Yes, Big Star is taking creative liberties. I mean, lamb in a taco??? Sacrilege, maybe. But it's fucking delicious. And it is ever-so-consciously served with a braising sauce that is just like icing on a cake. I'd like to see somebody eat it in one bite. They're retarded. It takes at least 3, but I prefer to stretch it out to 4 or 5 because the flavor is better savored. Stop being such a fat kid and maybe ENJOY the exquisite food that you obviously very seldom experience. I love their use of the radish. It shows up in many items and perfectly compliments the food. Great idea. I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have to say that the pork tacos are my least favorite. They're just too greasy for me, but isn't that the whole point of the Al Pastor?The alcohol selection is impressive if you're a bourbon or tequila drinker. Which I am. The tequila is as expected, but the bourbon selection caught me off guard. This is one of those creative liberties I was talking about. Bourbon is not typically paired with Mexican cuisine (or many cuisines at all for that matter), yet they stock a shit ton of very very good bourbon. I think the owners just have a hard-on for it. They just said \"fuck it\" and opened a Texas-themed bourbon bar that sells pre-prohibition era cocktails and serves quasi-gourmet tacos that the chef dreamed up while tripping mushrooms. Or maybe it was the fumes from all that white paint on the walls. Regardless, kudos to their bourbon \"Shot Of The Day,\" which changes daily, for $3. Also to Tecate cans for $3. Also to no extra sales tax being charged. The price on the menu is actually the price you pay. That should be enough to shut the pie holes of all the Trust Fund babies complaining about the cash-only policy. There's an ATM right across the street for God's sake. One other important point has been mentioned here before, but deserves re-addressing: the 7oz Schlitz draft is ONE DOLLAR. This is the only $1 beer that I am aware of in the entire city of Chicago, especially being offered all day every day. But here's the glitch: the 12oz version of the same beer is $3. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the bad math in this pricing strategy. The only advantage I can see to ordering the 12oz is not having to stand in line at the bar as often. I wonder how dirty of a look you would get from the bartender if you ordered three 7oz glasses of Schlitz. For the same money, you would get 21oz of beer. This is still blowing my mind as I sit here thinking about it.I will definitely be back. Probably tomorrow. Maybe the day after that. I'll take a day off, then I might go in the next day.

We were sitting at our table for at least a good 20 minutes before we were offered drinks. And then another staff came and asked us if we wanted drinks again, didn't ask if we wanted food, and then walked away without taking our order. We waited another ten minutes before our order for food was taken. We ordered three tacos and one entree, which should not have taken what felt like 30 minutes to come out, which leads to my next question...3) Why would you put three different orders on ONE plate? Are you trying to save your dishwasher some work or something? One of the waitresses put the plate down, hastily explained which taco was what, and walked away. Nobody but me heard what she said, due to the high noise level in the restaurant, and my friends and I spent the next couple minutes trying to figure out whose food was whose.

YOU CANT DO LIVE BAND KARAOKE HERE.It's a real bummer because I would have loved to sit, drink some beers, listen to the country music and eat al la carte for hours. I plan on doing this too, as soon as I can con three of my friends to come with me.The service is funky but it didn't bother me, but I could see how it would bother people though. You don't really have a server. It's just a carousel of mexican food and beers flowing in a counterclockwise circle. Like I said, that's bound to bother some people, but to me, \u00a0a carousel of mexican food and beer sounds like the greatest thing ever.However the food and the ambiance was fantastic, from what I could allow myself to enjoy.

YOU'RE OUT OF THE MINT JULEP??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? \u00a0Last time I checked there were only three ingredients in a mint julep: water, bourbon, and mint (well, and a little sugar). \u00a0I guess Chicago is experiencing some severe mint shortage. \u00a0On top of that our bartender poured me the wrong beer, the Lagunitas pilsner instead of the IPA. \u00a0I didn't think things could get any worse until some guy total rails into me with his shoulder after standing up quickly from his bar stool (recall me mentioning the poor floor plan). \u00a0He apologized, but this unfortunate event could have been easily avoided if they had put at least another 2 feet between the bar and the south side wall. \u00a0I mean, I understand making the bar seat as many people as possible, but there is barely enough space for patrons to stand while the servers are constantly running through the aisle. \u00a0In fact I should call the Chicago fire marshall in to inspect this issue! \u00a0So basically if you stand here, you are constantly getting bumped into on a regular basis by the servers trying to get through. \u00a0This can get annoying very fast.After our hostess told us the bar was now a free for all, we moved to the other side to avoid the full contact football and to grab some seats from a party that was about to leave. \u00a0We weren't there for more than 3 minutes when I got bumped into again.

No wait. Pushed two tables together outside, dove into some salsa and guac. I'm knocked up, so I was hindered when it came to the margarita chugging. (Though I did have a chelada. All you pregnancy police can suck it.) My two friends that had previously been to Big Star ordered a pitcher of their house margs, but with mezcal instead of tequila. I had a little sip and yowzer, they are not F-ing around. The booze and beer prices are reasonable, even bordering on cheap, especially considering the neighborhood. If you're like me and my friends and despise those syrupy, calorie-laden, hangover-inducing margaritas at other places, this is your salvation. Just hooch, lime, and ice. Ok, the tacos. I could only have two after the guac, so I went with the pastor and the chicken tostada. Both a solid B+. I was concerned with the one lonely corn tortilla holding up my pork, but it held together beautifully. The pork was nice and juicy and I liked the pineapple.

Two words... The Service.My brother was visiting from LA and we walked through my neighborhood looking for a place to eat. We really wanted to go to Belly Shack, but it was a Monday and they were closed. We trekked further down Milwaukee and came across Big Star. I had heard both positive and negative things about the place, but we were starving and headed inside regardless.The people that work here are rude hipsters that seem to not give a crap about the fact that you're there to give them your hard earned money for a meal. We were seated in such a way that amounted to being told \"There's some stools over there. Go sit.\" We were ignored by the bartenders/waiters for about 15 minutes even though we were ready to order about 3 minutes after sitting and attempting to flag down a bartender several times. We finally ordered and our food came out ultra fast, like within 2 or 3 minutes. At least the chef seems to give a crap about the customers. Once we were done eating the fantastic grub we couldn't even get a bartender to give us our damned receipt. He was more interested in figuring out which record album he was going to spin on the turntable next. We just threw a few bucks on the counter and left.In summary, avoid going inside the restaurant and just go to the take out window outside.

I have been here many times for beers, but have never had the food here. I like the decor, I like the radio tube amp, and the LPs spinning. I went in today to try the food. I have been meaning to do so for a long time, and today as I was walking around my neighborhood decided that it was not busy, so I would go in and have a relaxing meal and a beer. I ordered the pastor taco, the fish taco, and a chorizo and potato tostada. When they came out they were on small tortillas (smallest I have seen in Chicago) which reminded me of the little tacos sold in Piedras Negras, MX for 50 cents. The tacos were wrapped in a single tortilla which goes against the whole taqueria principal of \"dos tortillas de maize\" to hold together the wonderful taco meat/juices. Taco 1: Grade D The pastor taco was tasty, but the meat was exceptionally dry. It was one of the worst versions of this classic taco I have ever had. Compared to the Tacos Al Pastor at hole-in-the-wall taquerias this place really put forward a weak offering for a whopping $3 (well more than 30%-50 over the average price of a taco in this city). Taco 2: Grade A- Despite the failure to double tortilla the taco, the fish taco here was quite good. Was it worth $3? Probably not, but it was flavorful, and the sauce was perfect. Solid entry. Tostada: Grade C+ My grandmother who was born and raised on the US-Mexico border in Texas has been cooking tostadas for over 75 years and so I am a tostada snob. This offering was a tiny little tortilla (smaller than the smallest I have seen in Mexico) with black beans (also fairly rare in many parts of Mexico, and certainly Texas), and topped with chorizo and potatoes. Now Chorizo and potatoes is a staple in any Tex-Mex or Mexican breakfast line up, and this was done quite well. The only problem I had with this was that it was a tiny-tiny-tostada, and my grandmother would have had a word or two for the cooks for sure! Was it worth the price? Not really but it was good. Sauces: the hot sauce (red) is quite nice. The food was fresh, but not mind blowing. Cemitas Pueblas a few minutes drive or bike ride west on North Ave. is much better for most of these staples I must say especially if you like pastor. So, in the end what does Big Star deliver? It gives you quirky ethnic food without having to go into an ethnic neighborhood like Pilsen or a few blocks south of the Wicker Park triangle to Chicago Ave (Think Tacos Veloz). Everyone speaks English, and you don't have to worry about getting a taco made with beef cheek or brains, goat, or lamb by mistake. Many years ago, a friend described this trend as \"de-racinated\" ethnic food. You get the food without the people who make it getting in the way. It is a good business model, but paying nearly $10 for three tiny items was a bit much for me to consider coming back for food. It reminds me of a place inspired by \"Last Chance Texaco\" (why the Big Star in an old gas station?) which I have always liked when coming here for drinks on busy weeknights or any night for that matter. For people watching, drinking, and fun, and a snack on a hot corner in the city, I'd have no problem going back to soak in the summer sun on the patio and watch the beautiful people, but for the world's best tacos?

Everyone know it's one of the places to be in Wicker Park! A true testament to that is it being featured in the most recent Time Out Chicago. Alfresco season is upon us in the city and this is one of the prime locations to dine. My friends and I waited 90 minutes for a table yesterday but the great thing is you don't have to hang around while you wait. We put our name down, drove off and did some shopping, then they called us when they were ready. We were seated in their outdoor area and it was the perfect weather for the venue...warm but with a bit of a breeze.We were very slow getting service and just throughout the meal attention to our table was pretty weak. That could definitely be improved upon here. We waited 30 minutes for our beers to come up. C'mon now. However, our server was nice and friendly.A big plus with Big Star is the prices! Tacos are $3 each (took 4 of them to fill me up!) and beers range in price from $1-$7ish? But you can order pitchers plus tons of other drinks. Being the cheap girl that I am, I went with the 7 oz $1 Schlitz beer. It hit the spot so well I got a second one. Great deal!On to the food! I tried my friend's hot dog and am sorry to say it wasn't very special. Drenched in toppings was it's main selling point but that didn't work for me. I tried the Tacos al Pastor (pork shoulder with pineapples, very good), the Tacos de Panza (pork belly taco, extremely tasty but the pork belly was overcooked making it a bit hard to eat, slightly disappointing) and TWO of the Tacos de Pescado (beer battered tilapia with chipotle mayo). The true winner was the Fish Taco! It is highly recommended! The chipotle mayo on it was amazing although it had my weak tastebuds on fire. It was seriously so good, I ended up ordering a second one. Nomnomz! I also liked their chips & guac. I don't usually like chips but I couldn't stop myself from eating more and more and more!What I wish for Big Star...live music! Even just an acoustic kind of thing...a man and his guitar would have suited my fancy. It would have paired well with the whole atmosphere. Just a tad more attention to food.

I opted for 1 one each meat taco they had on the menu, and we shared some chips and guacamole. \u00a0So that's the fish, pork belly, pork shoulder, and (for $1 extra) chicken.The chips were excellent as they had somehow been seemingly infused with lime, it seemed like more than just a lime spritz on the chips as there was a definite hit of lime in every bite. \u00a0I make homemade guacamole all the time and I wish I could get even halfway to their result, it was as if the most perfectly creamy avocados in the world where sacrificed for this appetizer.Since we all ordered a bunch of tacos it was interesting that they just bring them on shared plates, so make sure you remember what you order since you'll have to do the match between friends. \u00a0Oh yeah, there were a couple decent draft beers incluing $3 for a pint of Stone Pale Ale. \u00a0Unfortunately that evening they were out of the draft IPA, as well as the Sonoran Hot Dog (a bacon-wrapped all beef hot dog on a roll) which one of my friends was talking about for the previous 3 hours.I started with the fish taco (Pescado) and yes it was good, but nothing worth raving about. \u00a0(Personally I think Carbon in Near South has better encrusted tilapia tacos, their sauce is better as well.) \u00a0I then moved on to the pork shoulder taco (Pastor) which I liked better than the fish, great flavor on the pork and I loved the pineapple and pickled red onions.Moving on to the pork belly taco (Panza) this meat was even better than the last. \u00a0And (unknowingly) saving the best for last the chicken (Pollo) was great. \u00a0The menu says 'marinated chicken' but no mention of the smoky bite from the perfect balance of chipotle adobo sauce it was apparently marinated in.

Finally, this weekend I waded into the great debate that are the tacos there.So, to start off, I'm a huge fan of the Schlitz. This is for many reasons. a) It's nice and crisp and goes down easy. b) The bad math associated around the Schlitz initially boggled my mind. Why would I buy 12 oz for $3, when I could just buy three 7 oz for $3? But now I think it's a masterpiece. It functions like google goggles. If the people you're with order the 12 oz, both you and big star instantly realize they're horribly, on-the-verge-on-alcohol-poisoning drunk, and you take them home. Right? That must be it. Otherwise it makes no sense.The micheladas are great as well, but I always have to reach for the tobasco sauce for some more spice, but hey, that's just me.And so, finally, to the tacos. It's really something else to be told that you get *one* taco for three bucks. You're like, haha, sure, it must be a monster taco. Nope. They're frigging delicious, I'll tell you that. Amazing. Goes down in one bite. But that's exactly the problem. It's over too soon! And if you're even remotely hungry, and especially if you've drinking and are ravenously hungry, you're going to wolf down 5-6 tacos, and where does that leave you? Working the streets for cash, that's what.So, in conclusion, I love your setup, Big Star. I watched them turn that nondescript little garage into you from the Damen Blue line stop every day for months. I was so excited to see you open. I dig your beer. I dig your bartenders.

We tried to squeeze in at the bar and grab a drink and maybe order some tacos. WRONG. The bartender not only didn't give us menus, she didn't even acknowledge us.

As I ventured further the landscape opened up and what appeared before me seemed to be some sort of hipster oasis. Flannel shirts, over sized sun glasses, ironic trucker hats, and asymmetrical haircuts converging in a short fenced play pen in front of what looked like a haphazardly renovated auto shop. The \"door guy\", in this case a young woman with aviator sunglasses so big that I could easily see the confusion on my face regarding the nature of her position in the reflection, asked for my I.D. and then told me there'd be a wait...\"I'll find a seat at the bar\" I said, and she nodded in approval. As I walked into the restaurant area I gained more respect for the establishment, as the the interior bar had that blonde wood that I'm finding more and more in new establishments across the city (think all of the Pony Inn and Duchamp...what I refer to as \"Norwegian Wood\"). Lots of natural light coming in as the entrance ways are two large glass garage doors and there are rows of bubbled \"moon roofs\" that scale across the ceiling.

This is the ying to Publican's yang in my opinion, and it's a welcome change to my common strategy of valuing food by its weight. Whiskey and beer selections are pretty standard, with the whiskey selection being a little more defined IMHO.

Good thing we enjoyed our drinks & had a place to set them down because waiting would have been awful otherwise. Points for allowing us to bring two dogs, one being a big collie that barked at random times. We got a lot of attention from them and saw a few other dogs on the patio. Patio is pretty crammed, so we had to keep the pups pulled in close, but no one seemed to mind because the table adjacent to us had a dog and everyone else seemed to be dog lovers, petting our pooches & smiling at them. Small beer list, but they had one on draft from a new local brewery, Off Color. It was decent. I also ordered an $11 Le Merle (great farmhouse saison) and $1 7 oz. Rhinelander (cute beer in a tiny bottle for a great price.) The other couple ordered a pitcher of margaritas & a couple shots of tequila paired with sangrita; very spicy, but they loved it enough to order a second after the first. Food was great. I had the queso fundido, the guys ordered a couple tacos, and our fourth diner was a vegetarian (can't remember what she got, but said there was a decent selection of vegetarian choices.)

I've been in Chicago for 22 years now and I'm still in search of Mexican food like I found on a regular basis down South. I thought my search would be over after eating at Big Star, based on rave reviews from friends. I was wrong. First off, the service is horrible. Our server was so disaffected she might actually have been nodding off from recently shooting up. (I rarely leave less than a 20% tip, just because I know what it's like to wait tables for a living, but here it was a solid 15%.) I felt like it was an imposition for us to be served, and the other staff we encountered tended to be a mixed bag (ranging from stoner-spacey to fabulous). As for the food: remember that Barbra Mandrell song -- \"I was country when country wasn't cool\" -- that was out in the early 80s? Yeah. Well, I feel similarly about all these hipster eateries. Besides really missing the live-band karaoke at the Pontiac, Big Star seems to be part of this trend of pseudo-foodies who like to bring their brand of pretension to the masses. The tacos I had were okay, but the chips were half-fresh, half-chewy/stale. The \"gourmet\" salsas were reasonably tasty but lacked any sort of bite. If the flavored had been used with a little more heat, I might have liked them better. And the limeade was almost disgustingly sugar-laden and NOT Mexican-style in the least (see Garcia's in Lincoln Square for a good approximation of Mexican limeade).

He's coming up here to visit soon, and I'd thought about taking him here but after eating the food myself I'd be embarrassed to do so.

The man, I mean asshole, was unwilling to give up the stool \"because his buddy was on his way.\" How chivalrous, you dickwad. Anyways, I could tell he wasn't a real Chicagoan. He was probably some transplant from Ohio or Michigan. I will say, however, that our bartender/server was super nice and apologize for how rude this customer was and looked for another seat right away for us. \u00a0Once you finally get a seat the service is rather fast. The food is almost instantly served, which is good because after waiting for 45 mins for a seat, people get antsy and irritated. Hungry people are mean, don't forget that!The drinks here are super good and I wouldn't expect anything less from this restaurant group. These drinks are not for amateurs that's for sure. So bring your foodie/drinkie (?) palate and savor the flavors.

I ordered a Lagunitas \"A Lil' Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale\" for $5, and i was pleased because most bars in the city will charge you over $7 for a beer like that. We each ordered 3 of the same tacos:1. Taco Al Pastor: marinated pork shoulder with pineapple, grilled onion, cilantro. This taco was very savory and the pineapple added subtle hints of sweetness. I thought it could have used some lettuce and more veggies for texture and cooling elements, but i'm no head chef, and i did enjoy what i was eating. 2. Taco De Panza: braised pork belly, tomato, queso fresco, onion, and cilantro. Probably my least favorite of the three. I thought the crumbled queso fresco was kinda \"meh\", it added more to the texture than taste. 3. Taco De Pescado: MUH FAVORITE! I wish i ordered more of these because it was soo delicious. Beer battered crispy tilapia, chipotle mayo, cabbage, cilantro, \u00a0and a lime on the side. This was the most composed in terms of taste and texture, and the chipotle mayo tied everything together to make this one hell of a flavorful taco. The fish was not greasy, but firm and crisp.

We wanted to try and see which one we would like better to know for future reference. We shared them all, and to our surprise they were delicious. We even order seconds! One on my favorite was the fish tacos, light and crunchy. My boyfriend love meat, and they had plenty of that for him. Each tacos was filled for a good amount of meat with their special toppings.

But onto the food. It was amazing - I had the fish taco, which was by far the highlight, huge (for the $3 pricetag) piece of perfectly cooked fish topped with slaw and avocado, this is a must-try. I also had the taco with pork shoulder and pineapple, which was also ridiculously tasty, great melding fo the pork and the slightly sweet roasted (?) pineapple, and again a huge portion for $2. The guacamole \"made to order\" was very good and served with a heaping portion of chips, but it didn't awe me as much as the rest of the meal.

Was told they don't quote how long it'll take to get a table, but the list ahead of us didn't seem out of control and it was a nice night so went ahead and waited for a booth to open up. It was pretty crowded inside but we still managed to grab some wall space and order a round of drinks by sending our tallest friend to the bar as to not be ignored. The crowd while we were waiting was pretty mellow. A funny mix of local hipsters and dare i say \"bridge and tunnel\" folks dressed up a bit too fancy for a night of tacos. But even my super cynical scared-of-yuppies boyfriend couldn't complain about the crowd really. We had to wait about 45 to an hour for a booth to open up (can't remember, but still not an awful wait - i think some people before us got antsy and left) - and the nice man with nice hair (who i think writes down little descriptions of the people in your party because there is no way to shout names over the din of the crowd and the funny country music) came over and showed us our booth. It was a cozy with 5 people in a booth but could have squeezed one more.We ordered a fair amount of food - a few rounds of tacos, chips and guacamole and a few more drinks. I had two pork belly tacos and a fish tostada. The pork belly was out of control. I sort of wanted the waitress to just bring me whatever bucket they had of it waiting in the kitchen. The tacos are a little small... but premium fillings in a freshly made tortilla for $2-4 a piece is a pretty nice deal. The fish tostada was tasty as well - a good char on the fish - and a nice contrast of cabbage/radish/crema on top - but would have preferred it to be a taco because the tortillas are pretty great. Drank a \"La Paloma\" cocktail (which was refreshingly on $7!) that was super tasty. \u00a0Some members of our party had the goat tacos - and said they were also way tasty. I'm not that adventurous. Our waitress was quick and friendly enough. The food came out really fast. And though the crowd grew and shrunk and grew again throughout our meal, we weren't rushed out of our booth - which was a pleasant surprise - being that we had a few parties staring at us from the bar. Perhaps they were staring at our mounds of food, but whatevs. All in all - the bill came to $73 for dinner and drinks for 5 people! YAY! We were all so full and happy when that bill came and it wasn't a zillion dollars.

Luckily this place passed :)The service was super quick. We got out food in less that 10 minutes. Both the fish and chicken tacos were delicious. The fish tacos definitely had more flavor. The chicken tacos were topped with Cotija cheese and pickled red onions. Everything was flavorful and appetizer size. It's definitely a fun place, its loud, had good music, good mexican food and a very casual atmosphere. It does get very very crowded on the weekend and the wait times are insane.

I always have a great time at the bar.But Jeremy, if you love this place so much so much why give it 4 out of 5 stars? Well that's because of my only two complaints about the bar. First, I feel that the tacos are over priced giving that they are relatively small. I could easily eat ten fish tacos, but that would cost $30 bucks.

My girl and I visited since we were craving Mexican and I had wanted to check this place out for a long time after getting one of their recipes from Bon Appetit. If you go in the later hours (after 9?), the environment should be understood before entry. It's lowed, pretty crammed, and a bit chaotic. I wasn't in the mood for this, but I didn't let that interfere with my dining experience. I'd have loved the atmosphere if I was a buzzed or with a group of buddies. The DJ was mixing it up and hipsters will in full swing. Ultimately, I enjoyed the Al Pastor recipe I use more than what Big Star served up. I did love the Queso and their pickled vegetables. The queso was perfectly browned, had an almost nutty aroma, and was loaded with chorizo and poblano strips. I've had the style of pickled vegetables they serve before, these were hands down the hottest and best I've had. It would be great to by a giant jar's worth to keep on hand. The tacos didn't hit the ball out of the park, more like a ground rule double. The tacos are a great size, about 3-4 bites. We had their Al Pastor, Pork Belly, and Fried Tilapia. The tilapia was good, I'm always of fan of the crunch you get from cabbage slaw and the crispy fried tilapia. Great with a squeeze of lime too. I didn't thing the Al Pastor was that great, not a lot of bold flavor or spice I expected. The pork belly was good, a tad dry, but some lime helped that too. The Margarita we got was disgusting, basically all sour mix...It was really busy, so it's likely the bartender was just trying to get me my drink in a timely fashion. I'd have waited 10 minutes if that's what it took to get a well prepared drink. Too bad, I'll just stick with a cerveza next time. \u00a0Overall, Big Star left me feeling satisfied but not impressed.

I will give it to them the premise (simple, ala carte style menu) is interesting and makes ordering easy and the patio seating is pretty killer. My braised pork shoulder taco was OK at best.

I tried their pinto beans recently, and though I wish they were a bit less liquid-y, they were plenty smoky and -you guessed it- flavorful.I just can't give this place five stars, you see.

Take credit cards from the hipsters and Mexican food lovers who crowd your place at all hours. Act like you're happy to see customers (you will live, I promise!).

All of the tacos are delicious. My favorite is definitely the pork belly; perfectly seasoned pork roasted crisp, sauced simply, and topped with queso fresco. However, the fish (lightly battered and fried tilapia with cabbage and chipotle mayo) and al pastor (sumptuous grilled pork/lamb with pineapple salsa) are also spectacular, and all go well with both of the restaurant's homemade salsas. The guacamole and tostadas (pig feet tostada currently on special is the BOMB) are excellent augmentations to the tacos..Drinking here is always awesome - Big Star has been partially responsible for many of my best nights out/embarrassing stories. Micheladas (tecates with salted rim and salsa) are divisive, but more often than not I find them delicious. Furthermore, it is impossible to argue with $3 shots of whiskey, all day, err day. Outdoor seating and seating-independent taco stand are also huge pluses, although during the 8 months out of the year when the weather stinks neither is a huge perk.In summation: I love to make fun of Big Star for its hipster vibe as much as the next guy, but it's definitely unique, and is one of my favorite places in Chicago.

I went with 3 tacos: the potato, pork belly, and the al pastor. I actually didn't care for the al pastor taco. The pork was rubbery, tough and chewy which isn't anything like what you should be served. A bit of a disappointment. The potato and pork belly tacos on the other hand were very good.

TERRIBLE DOOR POLICY/CROWD CONTROLI get that this place is a) a bar and b) a place where food is served. you guys don't kick anyone out, but you don't really let a steady flow of people in, either. This is kind of a problem, not to mention really irritating. There needs to be some rules, I guess, to make sure that people aren't waiting 2+ hours (I've been told this happens to some people) to get tacos and drinks. That's just not right!2. The food was good, but a bit salty. I ordered Tacos al Pastor and shared a Sonoran hot dog. The tacos had good flavor, but the pork was a bit too salty for my taste. My friend and I ordered the Sonoran hot dog at our own risk, and that too was too salty. I get that I am not ordering 100% healthy food that won't clog my arteries, but there is a line between something that is seasoned well and tastes good but is still bad for you and something that is oversalted and bad for you. If that makes any sense.3. The noise level. OK, I know, this place is a bar. Bars are loud. But I don't enjoy screaming matches with my friends, so maybe I'll just have to find a place to sit outside instead of inside whenever I am here next.With that out of the way, onto the good:1. Service was pretty great, considering the place was jam-packed. Our waitresses/servers were so nice and chatty, and they checked up on us often but not too often, which was pleasant.2. The food and drinks are reasonably priced ($2 for tacos al pastor, $6 for a huuuuge Sonoran hot dog, $7 for bourbon and coke, $7 for a classic margarita), and are delicious even though they are drenched in sodium. Their guacamole is one of the best Ive ever tasted, and their ingredients are fresh.3. Their drink menu is amazing. Bourbon, bourbon, and more bourbon, please! And the $1 Schlitz draft (7 oz) is pretty awesome.So, this place is alright but not the best. What saves this place from being 1 or 2 stars is the mere fact that they do offer interesting food and serve good drinks. This place is also a good place to people-watch, too.

I do wish it was a bit spicier, but spiciness is a fine line that I can understand. Some chips can be soggy while others can be perfectly crisp.Tacos de Panza: Good flavor and a generous heaping of both meat and queso fresco which goes a long way. The crispy pork belly can be a bit overcooked, however. Tacos de Pescado: The single piece of beer battered tilapia is large and remains pretty moist. Nice spicy kick from the chipotle mayo that I definitely noticed and appreciated. One of the better fish tacos out there.Horchata: Not too sweet which is a plus! And definitely can taste that cinnamon-ey goodness. Overall, I was pretty full after the two tacos and my half of the guac.

I also had the special taco of the day which is only$2 and that was an in house made pork skin with salsa verde.

However this is a bar or at least they heavily promote their wide array of whiskey, beer and tequila. I don't know anyone who usually carries that much cash on them to be able to afford drinking and sampling of all the delicious drinks. They do have an ATM inside but then think of all the bank and service fees. Luckily my friend had enough cash to cover both of us until I could pay him back.

I wanted 15 minutes the bar before getting a first drink...however, they were incredibly slammed for 9pm-ish on a Thursday night.-Cash only. Really?? Really??? This just sucks. I get why but still.-Very crowded, and you have to stand everywhere. I luckily ended up snagging two stools for my friend and me after I noticed a couple of girls getting up.

And the red onion would be better if it was pickled. This one was ok, but I wished I had ordered another al pastor. Their guacamole is good, not great. But for $8, no thanks. Another thing to add is the people who work there that I have encountered seem a bit snidey. Could definitely do without the attitude.

The result has been a minor sensation. \u00a0From day one, there have been long waits for tables or a seat at the bar, particularly between 7pm and 9pm, and most especially on the weekends. \u00a0But if you can manage to score a seat at the giant pine wood wrap-around bar, you are in for a treat. \u00a0Big Star doesn't trade in flat screens or blaring noise, the main draw is conversation, between strangers, at the bar, underscored by country music records adjusted to a perfect volume (enough so you can hear them, but not so much that you have to shout over them). \u00a0Sporting a stripped-down look (the concrete floor and exposed light bulbs recall a cinder block dive on the outskirts of Lubbock) and sans the usual ornamental overkill, about the only thing you can do here is drink and eat and talk, which may be why the crowd is mostly made up of bright thirty-somethings with the intelligence and confidence to hold a decent conversation.And while you're talking you can have a quality drink.Big Star is all about the bourbon. \u00a0Under Terry Alexander's expert guidance, Big Star offers 20 quality bourbons from the Buffalo Trace Distillery, 9 from Heaven Hill, and 4 more from Old Forester. \u00a0In addition, they offer 6 ryes, 2 whiskeys and 25 tequilas. \u00a0Already Pontiac is a distant memory. \u00a0And if you want beer - which the old Pontiac regularly ran out of - Big Star offers 25 American and Mexican varieties in bottles and cans, as well as five on draft, and they never run out. Big Star has taken one of Wicker Park's biggest disappointments and made it shine, good food, good drinks and down-to-earth companionability, the best qualities of a genuine Texas roadhouse. \u00a0We'll have another round.", "Date": "2010-05-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Crafty K.", "ReviewID": "sVwvtE7e1d-qgeW_KhwtUg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I came nearly after they opened on a Sunday and I had a great experience. \u00a0The interior is warm, sunny, calm, smells like cooking tasty pork...hard to go wrong. \u00a0I even said after leaving, \"I want my kitchen to feel like that.\" \u00a0Our service was great. \u00a0We had no less than three people checking in on us all of the time as we sat at the bar. \u00a0They were all really nice and helpful. \u00a0Our food came out right away and it was appreciated. \u00a0We had the guacamole which was pretty much perfect with great chips. \u00a0We had a one of the specials which was a chicken sope. \u00a0That was good...solid...but because the other stuff was so much more memorable it kind of fell down on my list. \u00a0Our next option was the fish tostada which was really nice, perfectly cooked and seasoned. \u00a0We moved into the pork belly taco (yum), the lamb taco (yumm) and the al pastor (serious yummm).I can't say anything bad about this place at all. \u00a0I really liked everything about it. \u00a0Yeah sure, it's not your typical corner cheapo greasy mexican place. \u00a0So what? \u00a0I mean seriously, isn't there room for variety and different takes on dishes? \u00a0If you love your standard taco then just do that and don't bother with different versions which you try and then have to complain about! \u00a0For people who like food...a lot...you're going to find this place has some really solid good food and a nice atmosphere when it's not as crowded.And with regard to people's price discussions I'm baffled. \u00a0The tacos were like $2 or $3 dollars. \u00a0That's expensive? \u00a0Really? \u00a0For tacos that are made with very fresh and good ingredients? \u00a0For meat that's not been sitting around in a pan in the fridge for a few days that's reheated on the back grill? \u00a0I don't really get the problem with the price at all. \u00a0I think the prices seemed exactly what you should pay for the menu items and I felt good about it.A beer, a Mexican coke, guac and chips, three tacos, one sope and one tostada and I think we payed like $25. \u00a0Seemed just fine to me.And nostalgia for Pontiac? \u00a0Really?What part? \u00a0Those horrific bathrooms or the food that came out of that sketchy kitchen? \u00a0You got me, folks.", "Date": "2010-05-14", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Rose N.", "ReviewID": "GcfvswM0K6wKAGWKqIEk-A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "yes it is a bit too hipster for my taste but the tacos are tasty and revolving, the beer is cold and most importantly the michelada and chelada mixes are the most authentic I have seen in the midwestI am not sure it is worth an hour wait but if you are in the neighborhood drop by see if you can stop in. \u00a0It is worth at least a 15 minutes wait. \u00a0Plus when the weather is warm the outdoor seating is prime.", "Date": "2010-05-20", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Emily E.", "ReviewID": "aeXsOfR6LXbrx09K2_tmCw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've walked by Big Star tons of times, and this place is packed 24/7.

Namely, the hoardes of people that are routinely spilling out from the patio onto the sidewalk every weekend in summer. I work down the street from this place and often consider popping in for a beer and couple of tacos, and am discouraged by the crowd. Because unless you're on your own and can squeeze in at the bar, odds are, if the weather's nice and it's thursday-sunday, you're going to be waiting f-o-r-e-v-e-r. Not just to get seated, but served and out.

You're in for some delicious eats, drinks, and tunes.These are the things that make this place worth coming back to time and again:1. Great Beer Selection. Not to mention Whiskey. As in...like, a four page Whiskey Menu. It's kind of intense. But in a good way.2. Their Tacos. $3 will score you a delicious, perfectly crispy braised pork belly taco doused in queso fresco. As if that wasn't enough, their other three varieties - a veggie option, grilled pork shoulder, or beer battered fish - are all excellent as well. I recommend shelling out the whopping $12 to try all four.3. The space. Despite the withering Manhattan Once-Overs I always fear I'm attracting, I love the atmosphere once I'm settled in and know someone's hard at work fixing us up some grub. The knowledgable bartenders double as DJ and spin a perfectly eclectic mix of folksy, bluesy honky-tonk records. The bar is enclosed in a converted white-washed concrete garage that's breezy and opens up onto a large, sunny patio. I feel instantly transported way out West, and invariably end up day dreaming until my food arrives. At which point I gobble up every last little bit and leave perfectly satisfied and shiny with that post-vacation glow.Bottom line, the crowds might be a little intimidating in nicer months, but it's worth the wait to come in for the Big Star experience.

My boyfriend and I had been wanting to dine here for a while but never made the effort of standing in the long lines especially since we are used to eating at amazing taquerias like Traspasada or Guanajuato but we finally made it in and I'm really glad we did. The best way to describe this \"taqueria\" and its food is modernized Mexican cuisine with authenticity. \u00a0The atmosphere is definitely busy. We arrived on a Sunday night around 7 pm and it was crowded but not crowded enough for me to get annoyed. It was a little confusing at first because the hostess wasn't readily there to put us on the list or let us know the availability. When we finally got a hold of her she didn't give us an exact time of when we'd be able to get a table but advised us that if we waited by the bar, we most likely would be able to find a seat within ten minutes and she was exactly right. We found seats by the bar and the gentleman took our order right away. He was friendly and provided our drinks quickly. We ordered the following: Chips & Guacamole, Taco de Pescado, 2 Tacos al Pastor, 1 Taco de Panza, 1 Tostada de Pollo, 1 horchata, and 1 Michelada. The Michelada as stated by my boyfriend was just like a homemade Michelada. He loved it. The horchata could have been better; it was more watery than anything which I wasn't a huge fan of. The food was delicious. It would be too hard to explain why it is delicious; you have to just try it for yourself. I definitely recommend the chips and guacamole because it was the best I've ever had and I've had some really amazing guacamole before. I would recommend the pork belly tacos (Taco de Panza) and the chicken tostada for first timers but honestly everything else on the menu is worth trying at least once.Big Star offers flavorful, quality food with efficient and friendly service. I look forward to coming back to enjoy another tasty meal. For those expecting 100% authentic Mexican food, you may not find what you are looking for but I wouldn't judge a book by its cover.

Normally I would like to try the Violet Hour, but not when I've been up since 4am and kinda don't want to be out soooooo we jumped out of line and went here (its across the street). I still was not exactly happy about being out at this point. Ambience - Walking in the door I exchange some joke with a person I might call a 40 year old hipster (also known as a MFA). This at least picks up my spirits, as does my friend informing me that they make tacos here. I like this idea. Inside was pretty packed, but considering there was no line I was able to find a place to sit and the crowd was really pretty subdued, diverse and friendly (a patron left his seat for my friend and I to sit together - we were 2 guys, so it wasn't \u00a0chivalrous so much as nice). The place was fairly full so I won't say the bartenders were particularly slow, and when I ordered food it was pretty much in my lap by the time I turned around. And they play classic country - does anything else go with bourbon so well? If you have been to Harry's Country Club in Kansas City and liked it, think along those lines.Drinks - I didn't bother with any of the foofy drinks. Miller Lite and a list of bourbon that will make you drool are the only things I really need when it comes down to it. I had a double of Four Roses Single Barrel. Awesome. The bartender came over and discussed the distillery with us because he liked this decision, which led to not only some nice bourbon knowledge, but a free taste of the Four Roses Special Edition (woweeeee), which was nice. Suffice to say I was feeling good after backing all that with some beers. The double was a good sized portion of bourbon, no complaints on that. Food - After heading a little north of sober I was told to have a pork belly taco. Awesomeness for $3? Sold. Perfect thing to add to a belly full of bourbon with a little bit of grease, crunchiness, and some cheese all in the mix here. \u00a0As the night progressed I ended up having another one and also tried the tacos al carbon - this was even better than the pork belly.

Ambiance: Not so much in terms of decor, but I don't think that's what they were going for. Personally I love hole-in-the-wall Mexican places where I constantly test my gastric mucosa against the likes of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and other enterohemorrhagic gastroenteritis-causing organisms (ahem - La Pasadita...mmm). Although I fully realize that \"Paul Kahan\" and \"hole-in-the-wall\" go together about as well as chocolate ice cream and mustard; Alaskan beauty queens and New York liberals; Stephen Hawking and the X-games; me drinking and texting....oh well. Space:About 80% of the interior is occupied by the bar. There are only 4 booths for parties of 4+. So if you are rolling \u00a0less than 4 deep, it's every man, woman, child and hobbit for themselves. This is REALLY annoying. Hopefully come summertime, there will be much more outdoor seating. Food:We started with the \"Salsa\" which we soon found out were chips that came with 3 bottled salsas that you get anyway with your food - (i.e not traditional pico de gallo). The chips were OK - I could have done without. \u00a0OK, yes the tacos are good. And this is coming from someone who isn't that huge a fan of pork (Please keep reading!! I apologize to my bro-in-law and to Kevin from last season of Top Chef). I had the tacos Al Pastor, Lamb, Pork shoulder and the Chicken tostada. The Al Pastor was my favorite - lots of subtle flavor. Just the right amount of topping. The lamb was also great - the sauce is what did it for me. And I thought the pork shoulder matched well with the pineapple. The tostada was so-so. My buddies also had the Rajas de poblano tacos, which they said were their favorite. (But I couldn't try theirs as each taco is literally 2 bites. Yes, I understand that small tacos with few toppings are authentic). Drinks:They have a great selection of Tequila and Bourbon here. You can't really beat $1 baby-Schlitz either. Price:BE WARY!! You may think that this place is cheap after looking at the $2 and $3 tacos. But, if you are like me and can eat more than your average-sized doormouse, you will inevitably end up ordering 5-7 tacos, which adds up when you're drinking. \u00a0And cash only?? - wtf?Summary:An OK place. More of a scene than eatery. It will probably be fun in the summer when they open up outdoor seating, but inevitably the lines will be long and annoying. Go for a snack and not a meal, and keep your parties to 3 peeps or less. As for the food - stick with the tacos. My suggestion - go down the street to La Pasadita. You'll save a buck, and get even more authentic food. Although you'll sacrifice the Citizens of Humanity-wearing crowd for Cubs hats and wife beaters.

I tried most of them, other than the pork ones, and they were all really good. Most of them are on the spicy side, so be ready for a kick and have a drink available nearby in case you need it. They also have really good margaritas and a pretty extensive beer menu. This is one of the only bars I've been to in the city that has Gumball Head beer in stock, so if you're looking for that, this is the place to go. Their bar also has some bourbons that are not widely available at bars in the city.The service is good, the atmosphere was fun and festive, and the outdoor seating is pretty big and looked very sunny.

Our waitress asked us literally two questions \"What can I get you\" and \"Is your food okay.\" We had to find her to get our check and she took over 30 minutes to get us change, even though she walked by our $20 bill a countless number of times. That means we spent over 3 hours at the restaurant, with no AC, on a very very hot day. Really awful service...I can spend my money elsewhere.As for the actual place itself: The atmosphere is fine. It's hot and gritty, but that's what I expected. The drinks are fine, although the bartenders don't treat you any better than the waiters. The food is fine, but 75% of the menu seems to be pork.

Even though it took a 45-minute drive to the blue line and then a 15-minute trip on the blue line, I had to try it out. I walked through a sea of undecorated Christmas trees and opened the flimsy door that looked like it came off someone's back porch. The centerpiece of this place is the rectangular shaped 4-sided bar. At 2:30 on a Saturday, I would guess of the 40 or so seats there, 38 were taken. And all 15 or so tables were occupied, always a good sign. I grabbed a stool and ordered a limeade to drink. Pretty refreshing drink, though I would have liked it a little colder.I ordered three tacos. The first was the standard pescado with beer battered tilapia, chipotle mayo, cabbage, cilantro, and lime. The fish came out very crispy and moist. The mayo added some kick as well. A very solid fish taco. Then I sank my teeth into the al pastor, which is marinated, spit roasted pork shoulder, grilled pineapple, grilled onion, and cilantro. Now I've eaten al pastor a couple of times before. Never has it been this good. The pork was so tender and had a little bit of a smokiness to it. There was just the right amount or pineapple and cilantro to round it out really well. Finally, I had the taco de panza which is crispy, braised pork belly, tomato guajillo sauce, queso fresco, onion, cilantro. This one was a little saucier than the others. The guajillo added a late kick of spice, not hot, but just a little extra kick. The crumbled queso on top really helped to round this one out. I still wasn't full so I asked the girl at the bar about the Sonoran hot dog, which was a hot dog I had heard about and seen on TV, but never tried for myself. She warned me I better be hungry. She also said it was around the size of a small football. I said bring it on. Within five minutes, it came out. A crispy, bacon wrapped, all beef hot dog topped with chopped tomatoes, pinto beans, lime mayo, mustard, onions, and hot sauce on a bolillo roll. The smokiness of the bacon worked perfectly with the juicy frank. The roll held up well, despite being drenched in so many sauces.

Now, to preface this, I have worked in restaurants and bars before. I am not demanding and I know how things are.

We all ordered three different tacos, wanting to try everything out. Our waitperson wrote nothing down. Not a big deal, I used to wait tables and I told myself the menu isn't that big, maybe she is a badass. It took a while, but I knew they had just opened and there are always kinks when a place is first getting started, no biggie. When we got our food mine was the only order that was correct. Again no biggie, but they never took the plates away from the other three and then it took about another 30 mins to get the right order. Maybe our wait staff should have written it down, but it was being made right. When it came time to pay, the waitress asked us if we had eaten the three wrong tacos, we told her we had and then she said \"cool, I will go ahead and charge you for them\" \u00a0Now, I am not cheap, we paid for everything and tipped, however I would never charge a customer for something that was my mistake.

The tacos are exactly the same, only difference is you can't order alcohol, and you're semi-removed from the energy. After a Pastor (pork) and Pescado (fish) taco, we walked into the bar area and I had their signature margarita. Possibly the smoothest margarita I've ever had for less than $15 (only $7). They mix in a special Curacao that really adds to the citrusy-sweetness of the drink. Once seated we racked chips with an order of guacamole and an order of Fondido, a warm cheese dip with mixed in chorizo. Both were delicious, only criticism is that they served us four flour tortillas with the Fondido, meanwhile we were a table of three, it wouldn't of taken much for them to give us six, and we would of never known otherwise if they gave us three. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the tacos more than anything else, with the fish taco taking the cake.Big Star's food is worth 3.5 stars, but the atmosphere pulls it all up closer to 4.5 territory.

As my group was hungry, I went to ask how much longer the wait might be. Instead of a \"I'm sorry\" or a \"Just a little bit longer.\" I got a \"Do you see an empty booth?\" Look, it's been over an hour on a Monday night, I'm not being unreasonable to ask an approximate time for a table. Like many places (Tango Sur comes to mind) there is no \"time limit\" on how long you can sit at a table. But unlike Tango Sur there is little to no actual seating.

We knew a little sumtin sumtin was goin' down in this heezey when Jenny spotted some goats chained to a dumpster behind this dig. Jenny was all, \"Oh, they're so adorable! Can we pet them?\" and I was all, \"I ain't pettin' no goats, they'll eat my Ed Hardy shirt.\" Jenny immediately wreckanized how important my Ed Hardy shirt was to me, so we walked in.It was fairly crowded, and we were fortunate enough to just barely snag a booth. I was all, \"Look! Those booth-sitting patrons are leaving!\" and Jenny was all, \"Ohmigosh, those other two people not wearing Ed Hardy shirts are making a mad dash for it.\" So we took several minutes to devise a plan on how we could get to the table before them. Unfortunately, the time it took to plan our move created a problem: those two people not wearing Ed Hardy shirts had already sat down. They were that fast. But screw that. We went ahead with our plan anyway. Palms up, I locked my fingers together and bent my knees. Jenny planted her boot into my hands and I sprung up with all my might. Jenny did at least three 360s, two-and-a-half twists, and a double fakie ollie before landing squarely in the seat at the booth we wished to claim. Seriously, this was some mad trapeze-artist sh!t. Those two people not wearing Ed Hardy shirts were in such awe of Jenny's skillz, that they immediately offered us the table. Then they saw me walk over wearing an Ed Hardy shirt and they changed their minds. But Jenny begged them to let us sit there and they finally caved...thirty minutes later. After they finished their food, drank their beer, and belched in my face because they were jealous of my Ed Hardy shirt.At this point, you can only imagine how starved we were. The waitress ran through the menu quickly, since she was obviously eager to serve people not wearing Ed Hardy shirts, and mentioned \"goat.\" Uh, yeah, she said \"goat.\" As you might guess, right about then, the flash light in my brain went off, and I was all, \"Holy crap. I totally forgot that today was Passover.\" Then the waitress looked at me like I was an idiot or something just because I know my Canadian holidays. But whatevs. I ordered the goat tacos to honor our country's upstairs neighbors, and Jenny went with the some-kind-of-fancy-chicken tacos. I can't quite figure out just exactly how they managed to make the goat meat taste so fresh and tender, but diggity dawg damn it was delish. It was the first time I'd ever eaten goat before and I must admit, these alone are enough to bring me back here.Outside of putting that juicy meat in my chops, I was otherwise somewhat indifferent to Big Star. I liked the setup, especially since the high ceilings allowed me to vault Jenny through the air, but it was too damn loud. I couldn't hear a thing Jenny was saying, and not just because I was admiring my Ed Hardy shirt most of the time. Also, the loud music made ordering a beer very challenging. I tried ordering a LaBatt's to go with my Canadian holiday meat treat, but I was brought a Blatz instead. Probably because \"I'll have LaBatts\" sounds a hell of a lot like \"I'll have a Blatz\" when you can't hear someone from three feet away. Who knows though. It might also be because the waitress appreciated my Ed Hardy shirt and figured I was a real classy guy, so she hooked me up with a Blatz in a can. Which subsequently nearly made me vomit.After finishing what might have been the nastiest tasting beer I've ever consumed in my life, I went pee. (In the bathroom.) Then Jenny and I rolled out of this bar like we was Autobots. And wouldn't you know it, one of the goats we noticed when we first arrived had escaped. Jenny, the kind-hearted person she is, nearly wept, hoping the goat didn't get hit by one of those big red tour buses with really obnoxious drunk people in them. So I had to wait while she pet the goats that hadn't escaped. But I didn't get anywhere near them because I didn't want them eating my Ed Hardy shirt. *Please note, my mind was a bit hazy this night, so some details may have been invented in this review.

Cool.Big Star is as yummy as it's hyped up to be. These tacos are totally delectable. Totally my style. Totally juicy! I do not recommend the vegetarian, however. I have trouble deciding which taco is my favorite. They're all so perfectly crafted. To anyone who could complain about $3 tacos, no entiendo. A taco at taco bell is $1, and this is three times that, but 50 times better. Mathematically, it adds up. So you pay $9 for 3 tacos. Um, that's how much a taco entree would cost at any regular restaurant. HOW is this expensive??? Right, it's not.The patio and the interior are so awesome. You want to hang out there forever. Therein lies the problemo. People do stay for hours on end. And you might never get a seat. Add that to the totally apathetic hostess (you're a hostess. You walk people to their seats. Walk. people. to. their. seats. I had this job once, and it is so not as cool as you think it is, lady) and your wait could be 2 hours. So try to come at off times, and enjoy the food.

Almost two years later, and the food and drinks continue to satisfy. The al pastor tacos are a favorite, and the fish tacos are an addiction. Many people agree with this. Often, too many. True, Big Star has become so popular that you will most likely have to put your name down and pray for a table. The bright side? They will take your cell number and call you when it's ready. Hailing from a primitive village in central Illinois (you know, the one by the cornfield), this is a revolution in restaurant seating. Put your name down, cross the street for a few drinks, and come back when they call you! The pickup window is an even quicker option, especially for late night drunken munchies.

She threw a diet coke in the window and said, \"Take it or leave it\" then slammed the window shut in my boyfriend and mines face. Our number was then called for his tacos, and she wouldn't give us our food. We had to get our friend to go up and get it for us.

This review is of service only, because we never even got a chance to try their food. We arrived around 8pm on a summer weekday night. I had expected a wait, but was excited to try the food -- misplaced excitement it turns out. When I approached the hostess, she was immediately dismissive about putting our name down. \"There are like 20 groups ahead of you,\" she snapped when I inquired about the wait time. I asked if she could estimate the wait time, and she responded \"I have no idea.\" I asked if at least she could tell us if was going to be like 1 or 2 hours, and she cut me off with \"It's going be a really long wait. But I don't know how long.\" Finally, I asked if it was even worth sticking around, if there was even a chance we'd get in that evening and she again cut me off and snapped \"Really long wait.\" with an extremely rude \"please leave\" tone. I can't believe the rate of table turnover really changes that much from night to night, so there is no conceivable way they couldn't even come up with a number of hours estimate, knowing how many groups were ahead of us. The whole encounter smacked of a smug \"we won't estimate wait times because we don't feel like it.\" attitude.We left to explore, leaving our name on the list, just in case. We ended up eating nearby, and right after being sat, with less than an hour wait, received a call from Big Star, saying \"table's ready\". I would have *gladly* waited an hour if the hostess hadn't been so rude, even going so far as to give us the impression it was hopeless to even try getting in. There are far finer restaurants than this who wouldn't dream of treating their customers in this manner.

This means that to go you have to be 21+ like at any normal bar. They have limited table space - only 6 tables - and will only put groups of four or more at a table. Any smaller group can grab seats at the bar as they free up. Because it's more of a bar, people tend to stay at tables longer than at a restaurant, and if the tables are all full up, it can be anyone's guess as to when a group will leave. No reservations. With that in mind....Food: 5 stars. PORK BELLY TACOS ARE NOW MY FAVORITE FOOD. Okay, they are seriously good. The place also has pork shoulder tacos with pineapple, lamb tacos, and roasted poblano pepper tacos. They have a selection of tostadas and salads as well, but I didn't try those. Good tortilla chips and salsa.Drinks: 5 stars. Good selection of micro-brewed beer, good array of liquors of cocktail making. Also have limeade and horchata.Service: 4 1/2 stars. Door people and waitress were both really friendly (I think ours was named Daniella??), but the crowds can make it sometimes take a little while.Space: 4 stars. If you have a group of 4+ and can manage to swing a booth, it's a nice amount of room. Sitting at the bar looked as though it would be crowded, due to the fact that the bar is in the center of the room and there isn't much space to walk between the bar and the booths.Atmosphere: 4 stars. Music is kind of loud, but it's what you would expect in any hipster-ish bar. Crowd is an eclectic mix, trending mid-to-late 20s.Other: 3 1/2 stars. Okay, so the fact that there's a wait and the wait can't easily be quantified (as mentioned above) is kind of a bummer, but if you go in aware of this it's easier to deal with.

That includes all 4 types of tacos, the beans, the queso fundido, the guac, all three salsas. Damn delicious. Their beer list is great, and everything is priced well.Two negatives though, dropping them a whole star:1) Seating sucks. First come first served is just awkward. You stand waiting for people to finish eating in hopes that they're going to get up from their stools. And there's no space to stand that's not just milling about in the aisle, so it gets doubly weird. 2) $3.00 for an ATM at a cash restaurant. Seriously?

Get with the plastic already. Find another way to pick-up the exorbitant $3 ATM fees. The drinks are actually not all that bad. Some strange flavor combinations, but overall not too bad. The draft beer selections could use some serious infusion of small craft and latin beers. Enough with the Schlitz and PBR bullshit.On to the squeeze bottles. The three salsas that are available are sitting around the bar in old six-pack carriers. Still not sure why I get charged $2 for someone to slide one of these containers within my reach. None of them is really that remarkable. They're just satisfactory. The handcrafted aspect of these is lost by being packaged in cheap squeeze bottles.The guacamole isn't too bad, though it could use a bit of lime and salt. Accompanying chips are fresh and crisp, but also lacking in salt. (Interestingly, when asked for salt, the bartender returned with a cocktail napkin rolled up with sodium magic. Were salt shakers outside of the budget?)To be honest, we only tried one taco, the pork belly. Pretty good flavor, but not really discernible as truly succulent pork belly. It could have been a fat hunk of garden variety Oscar Mayer. Not impressed.The real missed opportunity was the atmosphere. During our 45 minute stay, the only tunes to be had were d-list mariachi songs cranked out from a turntable. For the love of God.

The bartenders have been great, but it was our server last night, at one of the counters alongside the wall, that opened this door. After standing for about 10 minutes, we'd been ignored by several servers. Finally we just ordered from the bar. Like I said, they have been slammed each time I've gone, so it's understandable. Not awesome, but I'm over it and I'll be back. Can't wait for the patio.

The walking taco is interesting if not my cup of tea and more suited to a taco truck. \u00a0We also had some guacamole, which while tasty was a freaking rip off at 8 dollars when the chips aren't even freshly made. \u00a0To be fair every place tries to rip you off for guac. \u00a0Avacados aren't THAT expensive.If I could get in and out without any line and without them messing up our order and just ordered pork tacos, maybe I would come back. \u00a0But the stars will never align like that and even if they did it would still be a tiny three dollar taco.", "Date": "2013-05-07", "Author_Location": "Madison, WI"}, {"Author": "Robbie J.", "ReviewID": "sjgQZX0Ot3vdeuu_bPu0pQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Big star gets a 5 Star!

This review may seem harsh being that my biggest qualm is about the lack of salt on the food. But mexican food when done right is an explosion of flavor; a perfect balance of in your face with lingering subtleties. \u00a0If you don't season it right its a huge miss.  \u00a0 \u00a0With all the money and hype put into this place; grow some balls and salt the food. \u00a0And put a fricken picture on the wall. \u00a0I am going to have to come back to see if their cocktails are nearly as good as the violet hours, cause if they are its worth the trip back.", "Date": "2010-08-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Robert P.", "ReviewID": "pZ9aMBHweV4QvooybBYNdA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With taco spots popping up all over I have to say that they are doing it right at Big Star, I really enjoyed the food.

Their drink menu is about 8 pages long with many bourbon/whiskey based drinks to choose from as well as a section for tequila lovers (that's me!). Unique and carefully crafted, their drink menu rivals Violet Hour in terms of quality and creativity. The food menu is tiny, with maybe 10 items but everything is to-die-for, which is an adjective I use sparingly. I've had each taco on their menu (the pork belly is by far my favorite) as well as the fish tostada, the guacamole and their queso, which was described by a friend as having \"layers of flavor that just don't stop.\" The food pairs well with the drink offerings and the quality is top notch.In terms of the setting: The space is small and the focus is on the large bar situated in the middle of the room. Large groups will either have to stand or wait for one of the 5 booths. Both times I've been I've put my name on the list and been seated within an hour, which seems like a long time but it flew by as I enjoyed drinks and conversation with my friends.

The last several times I got a craving for their al pastor, I was really disappointed with the service. It was fast but rude. In a city full of delicious tacos, I have no reason to put up with agression and eye-rolls from restaurant staff. The rudest of all is a woman I've encountered when ordering from the window.

Another time she snatched the money out of my hand.

GO GET SOME TACOS!!!! \u00a0Don't base your decision on whether or not to go because I had ONE bad service experience. \u00a0Granted it was 7 hours of terrible service, but hey. \u00a0Maybe it was just a bad day for both servers we had. \u00a0The tacos are good, the drinks are strong & tasty which is a perfect combination in my book, and the patio is to die for.", "Date": "2012-06-14", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "David S.", "ReviewID": "ano7fN1EolmPBXqTc7l50g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Consistently goodopen till 2:00 AMhuman-sized tacos", "Date": "2012-11-14", "Author_Location": "Somerville, MA"}, {"Author": "Brittany W.", "ReviewID": "gDoALSa5pP09XwgjLyc4Hg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The experience begins before you even enter the space with the unmistakable smell of homemade tortillas wafting through the air, beckoning Wicker Park locals and non-locals alike into the square, one story landmark that is Big Star. \u00a0Upon entering Big Star you are greeted by a smiling bouncer and an array of small metal tables with mustard yellow chairs. \u00a0Just past the entrance the room opens up to a large, rectangular, lacquered, wooden bar and several large wooden booths. Floor to ceiling windows at the front of the restaurant (conveniently removable during the summer) let in bountiful amounts of natural light. The decorations are minimal: a single string of Christmas lights line one wall, Big Star t-shirts hang on another while a large light up \"tacos\" sign adorns the back wall. \u00a0In the middle of the bar atop an island lives an impressive collection of single-barrel Bourbons and Whiskeys as well as a wide variety of Tequilas and Mezcals (A different $3 Whiskey shot is offered every day of the week). \u00a0Six draught beer taps adorn the front of the bar, offering tasty craft selections. The vibe is very \"Wicker Park\" with a California-low-key-hipster-badass feel. Once I walk in, I choose an empty seat at the bar. \u00a0For a Monday afternoon in the middle of February, Big Star is not lacking in attendance; the majority of the seats in the restaurant are occupied. \u00a0I am greeted by a badass lady bar tender who was very attentive and nice but not at all overbearing. I am immediately given a glass of water, a one-page menu describing the Mexican-street-food inspired delicacies, and a leather-bound menu containing beverage choices for those of the ripe age of 21 and older.I wasn't going to let the fact that it was a Monday afternoon stop me from tasting a Big Star Margarita, which seemed to be a favorite as I looked around. \u00a0The margarita is served in a lowball glass and is shaken to perfection. \u00a0It is more tart than sweet but is still refreshing with the lingering taste of Lunazul Blanco Tequila. \u00a0Don't be fooled by the small size of this classic beverage because it packs a pretty big punch.To help curb my hunger as I perused the menu I enjoyed an order of fresh tortilla chips, guacamole, and salsa. \u00a0The house-made tortilla chips are served warm and were not over-salted, which I admire in a chip. \u00a0The guacamole is simple and fresh, as guacamole ought to be. \u00a0I must note, however, that while the guacamole is good, it doesn't merit the lofty $8 price tag. \u00a0The spicy salsa verde and the smoky salsa roja, both homemade at Big Star, are delectable and unique in flavor. \u00a0Now, on to the really good stuff. Seeing that Big Star is known for its tacos, I decided to try three of the five that are offered. \u00a0The Taco de Pescado delivers exactly what one would want from a fish taco. \u00a0The tilapia is impeccably fried with an irresistible beer-battered crispness while the chipotle mayo, cabbage, cilantro and lime tie everything together and simultaneously give you the creaminess, crunchiness and freshness of the perfect fish taco. \u00a0Then there is the Taco de Pollo which contains roasted chicken thigh tossed in a spicy, salsa negra. \u00a0The chicken and salsa sit atop a generous spread of black bean crema which offers the taste buds some relief from the spiciness of the salsa. \u00a0This lovely creation is finished off with crumbly cotija cheese, crispy fried onions and cilantro. The Taco de Panza is easily my favorite: a freshly made tortilla envelopes crispy bites of braised pork belly smothered in a heavenly tomato guajillo sauce and topped with queso fresco, cilantro and onion. \u00a0The slight crunch of the pork belly mixed with the lightly smoky, almost fruity, sweet heat of the tomato guajillo sauce is beyond moan-worthy. I would gladly eat ten of these, but that might be unsafe considering the food coma that was induced just minutes after finishing my meal.Overall, I would give Big Star a 9.5 out of 10 (-.5 for over priced guacamole!). \u00a0The restaurant is clean, the wait staff knowledgeable and friendly, the drink options potent and varied, and the food is OUT OF THIS WORLD. \u00a0For me, Big Star knocks other taco joints out of the ball park not only because of the amazing flavors the food delivers but because this place is just genuinely welcoming and makes you feel good. \u00a0I will definitely be back to try the Sonoran Hot Dog and the Queso Fundido along with another Taco de Panza or two.", "Date": "2013-02-26", "Author_Location": "Northbrook, IL"}, {"Author": "Tim W.", "ReviewID": "iCYEHLXQ3D1al2rEBpXEIA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok, so after hearing rave reviews, I went here last night with a hungry stomach, a thirst for whiskey, and a lot of cash in my wallet, ready to spend.

I write all this because my review wouldn't be helpful to the reader unless he or she understands the reasoning behind my three-star. If you are a food junkie for grilled fruit and heavy sauces, such as chipotle mayo, than I won't be surprised you falling head over heels for such a place. But for me, Big Star didn't fit the standards of my perfect taco. So here I am, giving it a mere A-OK. On the other hand, the beer-battered fish was cooked superbly! And the atmosphere is very hip, unorthodox. Perfect place for late-night groups to hang, eat, and drink. So if you're ever in the area, I hope you get the chance to try it. Ultimately, it's your preference that'll determine whether it's a three-star or four (from an objective standpoint, I don't think this deserves a five-star... not even close).", "Date": "2013-01-29", "Author_Location": "Roselle, IL"}, {"Author": "Doug C.", "ReviewID": "9F3AVLGwuJgp7sA_MCCljQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This place is all about location and ambience.

After we waited about 40 minutes and could see that the tables were not opening up that quickly, we decided to go to the carry out window and eat at the picnic tables that are on the other side. The menu is the same and since we weren't drinking any alcohol, we figured why not. WELL....as sweet as the hostess was on the restaurant side, the order taker was rude...and I mean RUDE!! I would use another word but I don't want this review to get flagged. I have never in all my years experienced someone like that. We placed our order and waited quite some time for our food. We ordered 3 fish tacos, 1 pastor, 1 panza and a quac with chips. The order comes in a bag and when we unloaded it we were missing the pastor. I went to the window with the receipt and told the RUDE girl that we were missing our pastor. She looks at me and says, where's your order, I need to see it. I said it's all out on the table and they were seriously arguing with me that I was not missing anything from the order. I had to bag it up and bring it to them to see that it was missing. The guy that puts the orders together tells me it's all there. Seriously!!! It's not there and you are arguing with me? \u00a0It's a $ 3.00 taco!! \u00a0After I again showed him the receipt and the order, he agreed it was missing and made a new one. The fish tacos both my friend and I did not like, the panza was OK but the pastor and the quac were delicious.

But, they do have a great whiskey/bourbon list and a great tequila list. \u00a0The beers are very reasonably priced for this kind of place ($3-5 in general). \u00a0They have some really interesting looking bourbon and tequila cocktails that run like $7. \u00a0Yes, the place gets super crowded. \u00a0I was lucky that I met friends who had already put our name in and been waiting, so I basically just rolled up and sat down. \u00a0But, within half an hour of our sitting down, the place got pretty nuts. \u00a0It was raining, so the capacity was seriously lowered by the fact that no one could sit outside. \u00a0I did not get any of the attitude from the staff here that other people have complained about, but I could see how a place like this could foster snotty hipsterism. \u00a0Our waitress was just fine. \u00a0Very nice, did her best to get around to us. \u00a0We did have to search her out and flag her down a few times to order more drinks, more tacos, etc., but she was doing a good job in a very crowded and loud place. \u00a0The food comes out very quickly, which was surprising and highly appreciated. \u00a0So, overall:-Get the tacos de panza and the tacos de pescado.-Don't bother with the margaritas unless you seriously just need a vehicle to get some tequila in your veins, STAT.-Be patient, and if you don't want to deal with the atmosphere inside (which can be overwhelming), order to go.", "Date": "2011-06-17", "Author_Location": "Evanston, IL"}, {"Author": "Jackie O.", "ReviewID": "RKWvjxeV72fbH1Yv5k_rVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place is so conveniently near my apt, that it's hard not to be obsessed.

There are absolutely NO SUBSTITUTIONS on food orders, so if you don't like something, oh well. Also, it's a cash only place and the plus is that they don't charge tax!! Hmm, think I'm forgetting one more rule...oh yeah, get their EARLY!! Doors open @ 11:30am, I suggest getting their by 10am, the place gets beyond pack and if you don't like noisy places then go for takeout, music will be blasting and you have to literally yell to order your food.

Those are for us. \u00a0Yo! \u00a0Wassup Steve!\" \u00a0I wave to my friends and they wave back. \u00a0The door man slowly rears his vacant head over to the table and back at us. \u00a0He tilts his head back, looked down his nose at us with his \u00a0jaded dead eyes and says \"You still have to wait\". \u00a0 What?! \u00a0 \u00a0 I immediately know what's happening here. \u00a0There's a lot of standing space inside but it's about 7 pm so they're trying to attract attention by generating a line. I try to reason with the guy but there's only so much you can say about a situation as elementary as this. \u00a0Then comes the words that all doormen live to say. \u00a0\"Look, I can do this all day\" \u00a0coupled with a shrug. \u00a0Why so smug? \u00a0 \u00a0This isn't the Met Gala. \u00a0It's a taco joint.

We finally get on the wait list, which is about an hour, no big deal, we go to the Violet Hour. We finally get a call 1+ hours later.... no one on the other end. Strange. We walk across the street, the hostess explains she hung up on us because the other couple showed up, but we'll get the next table (strike 2). We wait at the bar. I hold out my credit card, after about 5 minutes the bartender rudely looks at me and says \"cash only\" while walking away. I basically had to scream \"I HAVE CASH TOO\" in order to get her to come back (strike 3). We're finally seated and the waitress after some time comes up and asks us if we're ready to order. She was in street clothes, wearing a purse?!? and had been talking with a table near us for some time before she came over. We had no idea she was the waitress; it was very confusing.

While the food was decent, I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISRESPECTED BY A RESTAURANT STAFF. I am currently 20 years old only days away from my 21st, though I understand and respect the law and respect restaurants whom uphold the law. When the doorman asked me for my ID, I did just that, gave him my ID, with no expectation that I was pulling a fast one over on anyone. Shortly after entering, the doorman physically grabbed my arm and pulled me aside to make sure I knew he was watching me. He told me that I would be on the honor system, whatever that meant. Regardless I had no intention of drinking or trying to cause trouble. After this he informed both the waitress and the house manager that I was underage and after they all rudely pointed and starred at me for over a minute, the waitress came to take our order. As she took drink orders, she skipped over me without asking if I would like a non-alcoholic drink. (The nice bus boy brought me over an horchata which happened to be delicious). For the rest of the night, the house manager if she wasn't pacing by our table to make sure I didn't have a drink in my hand, was standing in the corning watching over me like a hawk. What should have been a lovely evening of family and friends celebrating a birthday, turned into a humiliating night where all attention was on me for being underage. I have lived in Chicago my entire life, born and raised (not the suburbs), and as much as it was a top five horchata, there are tons of tasty restaurants even mexican restaurants in Wicker Park and the surrounding neighborhoods, that are staffed by respectful people.
