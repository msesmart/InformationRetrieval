French fries were average - not bad, but the lobster roll. Omg. it was filled to the brim and there was actually so much lobster, it was hard to eat! I had to cut it in half to eat it appropriately.

Much like the rest of the resturants in the North End, this place had a wait, and you will, most likely, share a table with others. However the food makes it worth it, I had the Hot (with butter) Lobster Roll and a bowl of their \"Famous\" Clam Chowder. While the Chowder was good it isn't why this place receives a 5 star rating.

Though generously sized, the roll wasn't at all impressive, despite the reputation that proceeded it. Bland lobster, though it had a decent texture. Midway through eating the hot buttered lobster roll, I noticed a flavor not unlike an uncleaned shrimp...there was definitely the bitter taste of crustacean fecal matter I wasn't used to when eating lobster. Towards the end of the roll, I was hit with a strong blast of black pepper. Looks like it wasn't evenly seasoned, since I hadn't tasted a hint of that pepper through 3/4 of the thing. I recommend you ask for a wedge of lemon if you decide to actually try this entre\u00e9 for yourself. My friend who had the roll with mayo remarked that the mayo flavor was barely noticable. The fries that came with the dish were forgettable.In the end, it came down to $50 for 3 oyster shooters and roll, plus tip. ($27 for the roll, and $2.60-3.10 for the shooters). The Winter was my favorite, not being too fishy, with a meaty texture. The Kumamoto tasted like eating a honeydew melon by the sea...it had a strong ocean flavor, with a hint of melon. It had me waxing nostalgic, since this particular oyster originated from the very city I had lived for years in Japan.As for the service...it was decent, though a bit bursque and a bit bizarre, the staff talking amongst each other about the customers as though we weren't right there.", "Date": "2014-07-15", "Author_Location": "Cambridge, MA"}, {"Author": "Stephanie Y.", "ReviewID": "arb1iky4Ww3ggm41ocQLbA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Get your name on that list! It's totally worth it! In Houston, there's really no such thing as waiting 2+ hours for dinner let alone a box of pastries... in fact I don't even think I'd wait more than one hour for food at a restaurant (I get hangry); however, at Neptune, more often than not, you will have to give your name and phone number to the host/hostess if you want to have dinner at this restaurant. I'd recommend putting your name on the list around 5pm if you're planning to eat dinner around 7 or 8pm. My boyfriend and I put our name on the list at 5pm on a Saturday night and we were told that it would be a 3 hour wait. Being tourists, we were perfectly fine with dinner around 8pm. In fact, we took this extra time to explore and had dessert before dinner at one of the local pastry shops nearby. Around 7pm I decided to look at my phone to see what time it was. That's when I realized that I had two missed calls from Neptune (apparently, my phone was on silent). Luckily, while I was staring at my phone, the host from Neptune called for a 3rd attempt (3rd time's a charm) and I picked up right away. Lesson to be learned: After you put you name on the list at Neptune, make sure the ringer volume on your phone is turned on! After hearing that we didn't have to wait an extra hour to be seated, my boyfriend and I walked to Neptune and we were seated at the bar within 10 minutes. For starters, we ordered a few different kinds of raw oysters from their terrific selection. I wish we could have tried every single type but we might have spoiled our appetite just a tad by eating dessert before dinner... oops. We ordered 2 Wellfleet, 2 Pleasant Bay, 2 Summerside, 2 Beausoleil, 4 Kumamoto, and 2 Jonah Crab Claws. The crab claws weren't anything special, just regular stone crab claws, I probably wouldn't order them again. My favorite oysters were the Wellfleet and the Kumamoto. The Wellfleet were salty and buttery (YUM) and the Kumamoto really did taste like cold, creamy, honeydew! I thought that Neptune's description of the Kumamoto was weird but after eating these oysters, I could definitely taste the sweet honeydew flavor. Highly recommend the Kumamoto oysters.The Johnny Cakes were our next appetizer and I would also recommend ordering this. It's the perfect combination of sweet and salty. The salty portion consisted of smoked trout, American black caviar, and creme fraiche in a \"tower\" on top of a large sweet, corn \"pancake.\" Spread the smoked fish, caviar and creme fraiche over the entire Johnny cake, cut off a little piece and eat it altogether in one bite. It's divine. I wouldn't recommend eating these elements separately as the smoked fish would probably be extremely salty by itself. It's perfect when paired with the sweet johnny cake. Our last dish was an entree of seared scallops and duck confit on a bed of microgreens and roasted brussel sprouts, I LOVED the duck confit and the seared scallops. The scallops were seared on the outside and nice and tender on the inside; however, I did notice that a couple of the scallops were completely white on the inside while the others were underdone (still opaque) in the center. I'm not sure if Neptune was aiming for more of a \"seared tuna\" type of scallop (cooked on the outside, raw on the inside) or if they just took the scallops off the pan a little early. I didn't mind either way as the flavor was still spot-on (plus, I like raw scallops), but I can see how someone who enjoys fully cooked sea diver scallops may be a little concerned. The duck confit was tender and savory and the roasted brussel sprouts were perfect for balancing out all of the different flavors in the dish. Overall, my boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience at Neptune and I wish we had room for one more entree... say.. the raved about lobster roll.

Maybe it was because my expectations were so high, but I found it overpriced and overrated. I didn't mind the 1 hour wait, I was expecting about that. I was however annoyed that I was a single diner and for the last 20 minutes of my wait I stared through the window at a single bar spot I assumed wasn't being given to me for a reason only to have it become mine. I was also vicariously annoyed for the couple still standing outside when I was seated because the couple next to me had been waiting for change for about 15 minutes and actually WANTED to leave. The food really didn't live up the hype. I had half a dozen raw oysters and they were as good as any other raw oyster in the city. I also had the Neptune on piggy back app and was not impressed. The greens were drowning in lemon, the pork was under seasoned, and the server had told me there were four oysters on the plate and I was only served three. This is an easy mistake to make, but $16 for 3 oysters isn't \u00a0something I would have paid if I had known. At the end of the night, half a dozen oysters, an app, and a glass of wine came to $50 for one person.

Once we got on the list it was a 2 hr wait which honestly wasn't too bad since they take down your phone number and you can wander around until you get that call. To start off our meal, obviously I got half a dozen of fresh oysters. I had the bartender help me choose which ones to try, and then the guy sitting next to us at the bar chimed in with his favorite too. I love oysters, but am definitely not an oyster connoisseur and wondered if I would be able to taste the difference between the different kinds. To my surprise, I definitely could. I liked the sweeter/fruitier oysters. My two favorites were the Wellfleet and Island Creek. My boyfriend got the crab bisque bc he doesn't like raw oysters... crazy i know. I didn't try any of it, but he loved it.For our meal, obviosly we got the famous lobster rolls. My boyfriend got it cold (with mayo), and I got it hot (with melted butter). Both were delicious. I thought I would have possibly liked the cold better bc all the lobster rolls I've had before were served this way, but I actually ended up liking the hot version better. Now I will say this is not the best lobster roll I've had, but it is pretty dang good. It definitely is the largest one I've had. At the other places I've gone that I would have ranked higher than Neptune were a lot smaller.

After almost 5 hours of zigzag driving (we're awful drivers with no sense of direction), we made it to Neptune around 3pm -- our first destination. We made our way through the mass of people standing outside only to wait inside for about 20 minutes before the hostess acknowledged us. She was doubling as waitress so whatever. We were quoted a 2.5 hour wait which I had anticipated, based on the reviews that I had read. Soo, we went on a little lobster roll sampling run in the area (Pauly's, North End Fish Market, Boston Chowda Co) to wait it out. The host called us exactly 2.5 hours later!Even after devouring 3 lobster rolls, we were determined to sample a good portion of the menu. We ended up splitting some oysters, a lobster roll, and their scallops entree.The oysters were AMAZING. You're given a little paper oyster menu and pencil to check off the ones that you want. We decided on the Beausoleil (hints of champagne), Kumamoto (hints of honeydew melon), and Kusshi(sweet, cucumber finish) based on the interesting descriptions. I'm not sure why I was so surprised when they all tasted exactly as they were described hahahha but that was indeed the case. So fresh. Soo good. My favorite was the Kumamoto!Since all the lobster rolls we sampled before Neptune were cold, we decided to get the warm lobster roll with fries. Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed. It wasn't even that we were lobstered out or maybe we were? There was definitely a lot of huge, fresh lobster chunks but not any more so than on the ones we had tried at the other spots. Meanwhile, this roll was practically double the price! I also think the lobster could have used a pinch of salt. The roll was also a tad soggy. The fries were solid, though!The scallops that we ordered here are THE BEST THAT I'VE EVER HAD. These babies were monstrous -- plump, seared and seasoned to perfection. This dish \u00a0comes with d'anjou pear butter, duck confit, brussel sprouts and Maytag blue. Seemingly an odd combination of rather complex ingredients but everything worked perfectly! It was the ultimate flavor explosion. The brussel sprouts were roasted perfectly. The pear butter was very mild but welcome -- I soaked the brussel sprouts and scallops in it. The duck confit was salty, rich and flavorful. We didn't get the blue cheese on our dish that it was supposed to come with, but it was fine nonetheless. I actually think the flavor of it would have been too sharp if there was more than a sprinkling. The meal was definitely not cheap but I can't get over the amazing oysters and scallops. I most definitely will be back to Neptune the next time that I am back in Boston -- probably go on an oyster run while waiting it out!", "Date": "2014-07-07", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Peter I.", "ReviewID": "PTSjEhmdbn714xvfWPgkNg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sometimes it pays to be a business traveler.

We both ordered a few different oysters to try, a lobster roll and clam chowder. The oysters were so fresh. The lobster roll is the best I've ever had! We had it hot with butter (the other option is cold with mayonnaise). The clam chowder wasn't that great. The broth was pretty thin, but maybe all my life I've been eating fake clam chowder and this is the real way it should be made.

I highly recommend trying these if not all.After the oysters I had the PEI mussels which were served with toasted cashews, red curry, cilantro, lime, scallions and garlic...yummy! The mussels were good but not as amazing as the oysters. I have definitely had better mussels in Boston. The broth was tasty but the mussels did not really take the flavor of the broth.

It's a lot, I know, but I got the impression that the raw fish wasn't going to do the trick. I was wrong. The oysters were good and the descriptions were right on the mark. The shrimp was nothing special, and the price was high, so... The tuna was amazing. It's a tuna tartare and the seasoning is beautiful. The hamachi also had great flavor and was a larger portion than I expected. Between the fish and the stuff on top, you get a really good mix of flavors. The Neptune Burger was amazing. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. The flavor was so rich and you got a great amount of flavor from the beef itself. I was blown away from the first bite. I should have stopped halfway through, but it was so good I couldn't stop. The reason they lost a star is because of the clam chowder that my wife had. They warn that it's brother than most New England clam chowders, and the thickness of the soup supported that, but the problem was a lack of flavor. It was just bland. They don't put salt and pepper out, so there's no way to remedy the problem. Based on this, I cannot recommend the clam chowder.

No Mayonnaise or cocktail sauce at all - PERFECT!Crudo of tilefish : served in a ring, chopped pieces of white fleshed fish, reminiscent of Hawaiian Poke but without any added seaweed or chilies - fresh, clean, buttery, RAW!Lobster roll, in butter, served on very yummy bread and french fries on the side.

Loved.Before coming to Boston, I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and knew it was my must-eat in Boston. We came for Marathon weekend, so I knew the entire city would be slammed, but I was prepared for a wait. We arrived around noon on Saturday and completely lucked out! An hour wait! :) I gave the hostess my number and we got the chance to peruse Mike's Pastry and grab a couple brews at Goody Glover's before we got the call. When we returned, we got a seat right by the door. This place is tiny, but so full of Boston charm! We did get a kick out of people coming in, seeing no line, and then thinking there was no wait only to get totally blindsided when they find out the wait was now up to 3 hours :) Ha! So happy that we planned ahead! I knew before we sat down that I wanted that lobster roll. Hot and buttered. We decided to share it along with some a la carte shrimp cocktail, crab claw, wine and the New England Clam Chowder. The shrimp was very good. So fresh tasting! The crab claw I was less enthused over. It was kinda hard to eat, but I still really enjoyed the flavor. The clam chowder was VERY good. The broth was thin, which was surprisingly because I love thick, chunky chowder, but it was SO flavorful. The clams were huge and plentiful... we basically licked the bowl. Our first NE chowder experience was a special one ;) However, it was quickly forgotten once that lobster roll came out. Paired with fries, the sandwich looked small, but looks are so deceiving. The bun it was served on was mostly gutted so it was PACKED with lobster instead. And not just any lobster... this was warm and fresh... it was buttered, oh it was buttered, but not in a 'dunked' or 'globbed' way.. it certainly wasn't too much or too greasy. Even though we shared the sandwich, it was still a good portion.. the best being the middle bites where the bread was soggiest... YUM. I told the husband not to resuscitate me if I choked on the lobster roll. Gone too soon, maybe, but doing what I love: eating Neptune Oyster lobster roll.

We had a little snack before heading over. It was a Tuesday night and we were seated in 20 minutes instead of the 45 to an hour we were advised on so that was a welcome surprise. Our seats were at the bar so we could observe as the oysters were shucked. Looking over the selection of oysters, we liked how each selection not only listed their origin, but a description of their size, degree of saltiness, and finish. There was a lot to choose from! We went with Island Creek, Katama Bay, Pemaquid, Winter Point, Kumamoto, and Kushi so we could try both Atlantic and Pacific oysters. We also decided to try a hot buttered lobster roll. Did I mention we were hungry? To our surprise, the lobster roll was served up first (aren't oysters usually served first?) but we didn't fuss and just went with it. True to other reviewers descriptions, this roll had a very generous portion of lobster meat piled on the hot, buttered roll with a side of crispy french fries. It was delicious! Our oysters came up just as we finished the lobster roll so we decided to set aside the fries and start working on the oysters. The oysters were sequenced in the same order of our selections starting clockwise on the outer circle and then counterclockwise on the inner circle. Between the two of us, we had eleven oysters each and we were not disappointed! As we consumed each variety, we tried to see if our palates were in line with each oyster's finish, (i.e., fruity, brown butter, citrus, sweet, honeydew, cucumber). That was fun. The cucumber finish of the Kushi was dead on while others we had to think over. Saving the fries for last turned out to be a good move - a rich, salty counterpoint to the oysters we just finished.Neptune struck us as more of a locals hangout. Very cozy (read: small) like a lot of spaces in the North End but manageable. The noise level is a little high but we were fine with it. Some might balk at a $27 lobster roll plate but for the price, you're getting a very generous portion of lobster with that so I wouldn't expect a McD's price. And of course, the oysters were superb!

Maine Lobster Roll -- Hot and buttery with heaps of chunky lobster meat. No mayo, no skimpy shreds of lobster, no filler, just lobster.2. Neptune Burger -- I know what you're thinking: Really? A burger? But this is no ordinary burger- it is a deliciously juicy and moist burger cooked to perfection topped with garlic mayo and fried oysters. It just works and it is so delicious and messy and one of the most affordable items on the menu.3.

Lobster roll FRIES and BUN: The roll itself is still chock full of large chunks of lobster, but the bun was a little soggy, and the fries are just as limp and boring as ever. I mentioned this in my previous review. I should also note that although the place does not take reservations and there is almost always a wait, the staff here has generally been pretty accurate about wait times. I mean, how annoying is it when a restaurant tells you the wait is 30 minutes and you show up half an hour later just to wait another half hour? I'd much rather have a restaurant tell me that the wait is an hour from the get go. I've never had to wait significantly more than Neptune said I would.

It's really thin though which I found odd but the menu says it's made to order so it makes sense that there isn't much time for it to get as thick. It's not sitting in a pot all day, it's made right after you order it. The flavor was amazing and the clams were nice and tender. Definitely the thing to order at this restaurant.

Seriously, I don't know what was wrong with me that night but I guess since it was cold my brain must have been malfunctioning and I wanted the warm version with butter. Now, the lobster was delicious. The roll was packed with huge chunks of it and it was cooked nicely..but perhaps a touch over. However the warm butter made the roll very soggy and unappetizing for me. Should have stuck with the classic cold version! Ugh, what is wrong with me? The fries that came on the side with it though were absolutely delicious. Some of the best fries I've had.

No taste either on the lobster. It was hot bland mess. My mom couldn't even finish it because the lobster was so chewy. The best part of the dish were the fries and that's even a stretch.

The toasted roll serves as a merely functional vehicle for resting shimmering, warm, tender, juicy chunks of the choicest shell fish.

There are no more than 20 seats (bar included) in the whole place.We got the Beausoleil oysters from Shippagan, NB, Kumamoto oysters from Willapa Bay, WA, and Kusshi oysters from Vancouver, BC. All of them were incredibly fresh and clean. The Beausoleil oysters were my favorite with the light aftertaste of champagne. The Kusshi oysters were refreshing with its cucumber finish.The clams were great! I loved the clear, flavorful broth with bits of corn and tomato. It wasn't too salty and the flavor palate was wonderful. Later, I tried to dip everything in sight in this broth haha.The clam chowder was interesting. It was served in a very flat bowl (or rounded plate) and tasted different from what I'm used to. It was very smooth, but a lot less milky than usual.The lobster roll was pretty good. It was rich, buttery, and seasoned. They used the good parts of the lobster meat and not an overpowering amount of mayo (like some other places). The highlight of the night was definitely the dinner special, the lobster risotto. This dish could have been disastrous, but it wasn't. It was AH-MAZING! The risotto was cooked to perfection and it wasn't too creamy or heavy. You could taste the lobster in every single bite, which is a feat in itself, and the corn kernels gave the dish a bit of sweetness.The hostess was very snappish and rude, especially when we called three hours in to check the status, but I have to give it to her - she has a pretty tough job and she needs attitude to do it. Still, just know that she will express no remorse for having you wait so long.Overall, the food was absolutely phenomenal, some of the freshest and most flavorful seafood I've had, and I totally get why the lines are so long.

Hands down my favorite of the bunch.* Kusshi - another oyster not to underestimate or overlook due to its size. The cucumber finish was immediate, and the description of \"low salt and sweet\" was defined correctly. * Shrimp Cocktail - this was huge! It filled me up 100%. I didn't think the shrimp was as tender as others that I've had but it was SO HUGE, I am not holding anything against it.* Jonah Crab Claws - MUST HAVE. I can't even put in words how delicious the claw was... it was just that wonderful!!I say skip the clams. Not worth it, and the littleneck clams taste so much better in a clam chowder, but not by itself. And speaking of chowder, pass here. I'm a fan of traditional chowder (you know... thick and chowder-y), but Neptune's Clam Chowder was like clam potato soup. It was extremely oily and had way too much potatoes and not enough clams.

Bear in mind that unless you come here between 2 and 4, or after 9, expect a wait. Just an FYI that a wait was expected and I'm not complaining about that, as it wasn't bad at all - they told us 75 minutes and called us back after an hour saying that our table was ready. Despite the place being very busy, the staff who took our name for the wait list, as well the staffer who called us back, were both very friendly.Moving inside, the place is packed and tiny. People also walk in with babies and young children, so it can be challenging to move around, especially when people are trying to carry collapsed stollers through to store back by the kitchen while they eat.Ok, so to eat? I had really been anticipating their lobster roll ($27) and ordered that. As for my girlfriend, she had the Flash Seared Nantucket Yellowfin Tuna ($34). I had the lobster roll served Connecticut style, which is just warm, with butter. I looked over the raw bar menu and while it looked tempting, we just stuck with our entrees and water to drink.When our food arrived, what others have said about Neptune's Lobster Roll is very true - it is epic! It huge and filled with a lot of lobster. The brioche roll is soft as well and it a nice touch, as compared to a hot dog bun.Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends. In terms of taste and flavor, the lobster roll was very disappointing. Both the roll and the lobster were saturated with butter, and I mean really, terribly oversaturated. Perhaps I made a mistake and asked for lobster with my warm butter roll? I've also tasted fresher lobster meat. Not that what they were serving had gone bad, but it really didn't have the taste of the ocean.I also tried some of my girlfriend's tuna and when it comes to flash searing, Neptune's definitely nailed the cooking technique. It was perfectly flash seared. However, in the end, this dish was also disappointing. It may have been perfectly flash seared, but it didn't seem to have any seasoning or flavor to it whatsoever. In the end, just the Lobster Roll and Seared Tuna, with tax and tip, came to $75.I'm sure the raw bar here is top notch. Definitely no complaints about the service.

The fries were delicious, some of the best I've had anywhere. But the fish, while cooked perfectly, was so chewy and stringy that I could not finish most of it. Literally, I could not chew it to bits enough so I could swallow it. I later learned that they use skate wing for the fish and chips. There is a reason every other restaurant uses a basic flaky white fish, like haddock or cod, and the skate ruined the meal.I encouraged my wife to try something other than the lobster roll (she usually gets the lobster roll), which I understand to be quite good, but which is certainly not worth the $27 price tag. She tried and loved the vitello tonnato sandwich. Pulled veal and raw tuna created a great, unique sandwich. She also loved the oysters she tried.

I would give 3.5 stars...but Yelp does not do that.I was so so excited to visit this place after Yelping and seeing the number of shiny red stars. I planned my Boston itinerary so that I could visit this place at 11.30am (opening time) and not stand in line in the cold. I went at noon instead and had to wait for around 30 mins. Pro: You leave your number and they will call you, so you can explore the area and check out other foods. Just make sure to come to the restaurant when they call you saying when to go over rather than wait for them to call a second time (I don't think they will call a second time). We had the oysters and clams (all from the MA area) since my bf thinks that it makes sense if we eat oysters from the area rather than those from New Orleans or somewhere further out. He loves oysters and enjoyed them a lot. They looked extremely fresh as well. We then had the famous and recommended lobster roll. This was where I was disappointed. This was one of the most expensive dishes ($27). The amount of lobsters definitely justified the price , I am pretty sure there was an entire lobster meat in there...however, I wasn't crazy over the entire product. I felt that other places can easily reproduce that just by being more generous with the lobster meat and then increasing the price justifiably. An experience is worth it, but I don't think I would come here and get it again. Lastly, we had the clam chowder ($11). This was placed in a rather shallow dish so the amount wasn't a lot. However, as usual, Neptune Oyster is generous with their seafood and there was definitely clam to be seen in the clam chowder. I usually have the San Francisco style clam chowder (think Boudin) that is more thick and creamy, while this was more ... for lack of a better word..less creamy and more soupy. In my opinion, the pepper was too strong for me. To know where it really stands, I tried some clam chowder in Quincy Market and well, I guess the clam chowder in Neptune Oyster is more legit and not buried in milk and cream, but I would still prefer if it were less overpowering.

As I went to order my companion for the night who had dragged me into this amazing place that could cause my death turned to the waiter and explained I was allergic to shellfish and was it possible to get a few of the daily specials even if it wasn't that day.He said they'd work something out and bring out a few things.Note: I don't believe this is something they do on the regular...in fact I guarantee it was only because of the company I was keeping.

Once they told us they were back a second time, I was sold. I was skeptic about getting a lobster roll since I read on other reviews that it wasn't that good, but they said if you like lobster rolls, just get it and you can be the judge yourself. Wise Words!We ordered oysters, fried calamari, salty fish, clam chowder (it was the thin kind of soup, not the traditional New England Thick kind) and mussels, for appetizers. All fantastic, but my favorite was the fried calamari and the messels a close second (mussel sauce was spicy)For a meal which I shared, I ordered a lobster roll (hot- which means it was made with butter. Cold is with mayonaise) and Yellowtail Tuna. Yellowtail Tuna was great, but the highlight was definitely the LOBSTER ROLL. Huge chucks of lobster, it was $25, but so worth it.

The wait is as everyone describes. Be prepared to wait at least an hour. The great thing though is that they take down your cell phone number so you do not have to wait around the restaurant. There is plenty to see in the North End/Fanuiel so you can wander around. However, coming in the cold winter may be a bit harder.The restaurant is incredibly small. You will most likely be sharing a table, and if you have a party of 5 or more, you shouldn't even expect to sit together. It is not really a restaurant for large parties. The oysters are decently priced at $2-$3 each, and they are shucked better than anywhere else. The oysters came right out of the shell. Sometimes at other restaurants I have to continue scraping parts of the oyster out myself. They also taste like they just came fresh out of the ocean.On to the lobster roll... hot vs. cold... I ended up trying both as my friend and I split them. The hot buttered one was savory and tender. The portions aren't as big as my friend described, but they are decent. The cold lobster roll tasted not too much different from lobster rolls elsewhere, but they are good. My only complaint is that the fries were two notches too salty and combined with two canker sores in my mouth, I was in extreme pain. Despite having the canker sores, I don't think I would have enjoyed the side of salty fries. It was also very expensive at $27 a plate.

It was steaming hot and I didn't really have anywhere else to go, so I went to the cafe next door. Now the food experience: Oysters: I select the small/medium lobsters with sweeter, non salty finish. For example, kumamoto and kusshi. They don't even have that many that would fall under my favorite bucket. Tried 6 kinds. None of them left me with a wow and a sweet finish taste in my mouth... Some of the oysters are not even that clean. Definitely can't compare to Aqua grill in NY or Swan Oyster Depot in San Fran.

I loved it!Clam Chowder: Major disappointment. I don't understand how they can be proud of their chowder... There wasn't that much clam in it and the soup was simply watery, not creamy at all. It still has pretty good taste but not your typical think clam chowder.Lobster roll: I would give a 5 star for the warm lobster roll. Best I have had in my life. It could be too buttery for some people though. The butter really soaked the lobster. Scallop: the scallops were huge and seared pretty well. Good dish but nothing mind blowing.

They said Neptune was probably popular because it had such a great variety of oysters- like there was 20 types of oysters on the menu. Are there even that many species of oysters? And they all looked the same too. I did muster up the courage and try the clams. The two types of clams, Littleneck and Cherrystone. Honestly, they tasted the same to me. Both were pretty salty - I felt like I was drinking the ocean. But once you got past that gross saltiness, the clams were pretty yummy, chewy, and rich. The clam chowder was good - nothing extraordinary. It was light, rich, and actually had a lot of clams in it. The lobster roll was HUGE. For $25, it was a pretty good deal.

There was no body, no creaminess, even the potatoes were lackluster. Not even sure if there were any real clams in there. If you told me it was a canned chopped clams, I would have believed you. Didn't taste homemade. No love at all. Opening a can of Campbell's would have been more fulfilling. Maybe it's a New England style I don't know of, but I prefer the chunky, creaminess of a rich soup.

I told the girl we had walked back to our hotel and it would be a good 30 to 45 mins before we'd be back....she was fine with that and said she \"would have a place when we got here.\" We took a cab and got there in about a half hour. I walked in (girlfriend waited outside due to the size of the place). The guy in front of me was told a 2 1/2 hour wait (sounds familiar) the hostess asked who was next and while others were waiting I told her we had received a call back and we were seated right away (amazing). The place has maybe 15 stools at the Bar and 25 table seats. When I went to sit down I felt guilty cause I thought my butt was touching the appetizer at the table next to us...it was really a tight squeeze between tables. We sat down and were quickly asked for our drink orders. I chose a local (Harpoon) IPA and girlfriend chose a sparkling wine.For apps we had a P.E.I. Mussels which is a mussels in a red curry broth...absolutely delicious...as I ate this and wished there was bread to soop up the broth in this dish the waitress came out and offered us up bread....Thank you Neptune!!!! We also ordered the Neptune's On Piggyback which is described as: crispy oysters, Berkshire Pig, golden raisin confiture, pistachio aioli...it was good but not as good as the mussels.For dinner I ordered the Monkfish Cassoulet and my girlfriend ordered the Bank Scallops...both were amazing in their execution. We sampled each others and I think we both think we should have ordered each others dish.....It is cramped, but it is beyond delicious!

I went on a Saturday morning at 11 AM or so. Got there and there was already a line outside the restaurant. The restaurant opened promptly at 11:30 AM and we got seated right away. The set up of the restaurant inside is not very big; there's lots of bar seating in addition to tables that line the wall. The staff were all extremely friendly. I think for those come later and can't get seated, they get put on a wait list and then the restaurant will call you when seats open up. What I really liked was that there was a separate oyster menu that featured the different types of oysters they had available for that day. For example, when I went they had Moon Shoal, Watch Hill, Kumamoto, Summerside, East Beach Blonde, Pleasant Bay, etc. They even list a description of the different oyster types, including size, salt level, and flavor. I heard the Lobster Roll here was amazing so I had to order that. Got the hot lobster roll and had to say it was quite yummy. I'm a big fan of butter - so I asked for some butter on the side. I'm not going to say this is the best lobster roll I've ever had, but I loved the fact that they definitely filled that roll up with lots and lots of fresh lobster. No skimping out on meat is a definite plus in my book! I also had the neptunes on piggyback. The pork they used in this dish was moist and flavorful. There's supposed to be crisp oysters in this appetizer as well, but I felt like the pork is what made this dish and was the flavor you could really taste. If I had to recommend a dish from this restaurant, I would say to go for the seared georges bank scallops. This was my favorite part of my meal. The scallops were cooked perfectly and it's on a bed of duck confit. The duck was a bit on the drier side, but still had really good flavor.

It wasn't bad, but it lacked flavor. \u00a0It's a VERY light chowder. If you're expecting a chunky chowder - this is not the one for you. It had a liquid, thin consistency. There was also more potatoes in it than actual clam. I probably had about 3 pieces of actual clam.", "Date": "2013-06-12", "Author_Location": "Chantilly, VA"}, {"Author": "Jessica O.", "ReviewID": "li2_m6iTtWBlWwQMg9WYeA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best Lobster Roll in Boston? You bet I'm gonna show up :)I got here shortly after opening on a Monday, and got a cozy spot right up at the bar.

I had the Lobster Roll (hot buttered CT style), my wife had the Cioppini which was also very good.

The Cioppini was very good, although you can find dishes of similar auality elsewhere in Boston. It is delicious and the quality of the seafood is superb.The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is the ridiculous wait time both times we have gone there. Neptune is good and definitely worth a visit, it is not however, worth a 3 hour wait on a Saturday afternoon. Also, our waitress seemed \"annoyed\" that she forgot one of our guests chowders orders, then even more annoyed that she forgot one of our Steamed Littleneck orders. Be apologetic, not defensive.

And the Lobsta Roll certainly is what Bostons LOVE. This is it, this is what everyone hypes about and do I hate giving into the hypes, but hey, we only live once, why not give it a shot? So, after grabbing amazing pastries at Modern Pastry and Mike's Pastry, we headed over for lunch at Neptune Oyster... and boy is this place tiny. And I mean, tiny. It is literally a one person walkway with a row of booth seating at your left hand side and about 15 bar seats to your right hand side. And directly infront of you is the kitchen and a small restroom. Okay, so this place was already packed on a Sunday afternoon at 11:30am. Figured. Nonetheless, we were here and we were ready for some lobsta. The one waiter holding down the fort of 10+ people at the entry way, squeezing side by side, was able to take down our names and phone number for our small party. The wait was going to be an hour and a half and that he'd give us a call once our table was ready. So definitely plan somethng to do within that time. We went to see Paul Revere's house (2 minute walk). Surely enough, after exploring the Paul Revere house two streets down and around the corner, an hour and a half passed and our phone call drew us back out into the 23 degrees F boston air and into the warm Neptune Oyster abode.Obviously, it was a given that we came for the hot, buttered Lobster roll $27 that everyone has been raving about. Man, was the lobsta and buttered roll so freaking delicious. Gracious chunks of lobster meat, lean, tossed in a light mayo dressing, and wrapped in a hot, buttered, toasted pillowly bread. Yeah, it was good. The french fries were just as amazing, though a bit salty, but so devilish good. Hot and crispy on the outside and cotton soft on the inside. We also ordered the large North End Cioppino $25. And, honestly, I thought the North End Cioppino stole the show with the flavorful seafood broth and generous amounts of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallops, etc) drenched over delicious saffron rice. My spoon just kept going for more and more. It was 1000x more delicious than any Ciopponi I've ever had in San Fran. So, all I've really got to say is, if you're in North End with enough time on your hands, you've got to try Neptune Oyster's lobster roll and cioppino. Its a must. I dont want to overhype it, because you will have too high of expectations and then not enjoy it as much.

All my meals here (countless times) have been nothing short of amazing, and I've tried almost the entire menu (I'm fat, leave me alone).If it's your very first visit, the obligatory order is raw oysters on the half shell (there's a dozen variety to choose from) and the hot butter Maine lobster roll, which has been featured in gourmet food magazines. I like to complete my meal with a refreshing blood orange bellini. My other fave items from the menu: blue crab cocktail, buttermilk johnnycake, yellowfin tuna, fish tacos (Sunday Special) and lobster spaghettini (Monday Special).Despite the long wait and no reservation policy, I always find myself returning to Neptune Oyster for every occasion and even when there's no occasion at all :)", "Date": "2012-11-20", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Christina T.", "ReviewID": "7KBEh-zdVXFO2Mk6iTn_TQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you like warm lobster rolls, this one will NOT disappoint.

It took about 10 minutes to get a beer as there were only two servers and the place was full but only 5 minutes to get our dozen oysters and 5 more minutes to devour them. They were amazing! So fresh, no sand or particles, didn't even need sauce because of the richness of flavor, and keeping the card was great to see where the oysters came from that we were eating. The place is very tiny so I'm not sure how the line is on busy days but we went around lunch time on a Wednesday and were able to get a table right away.The portions I saw (especially the fish and chips special, $24) were enormous! The pictures almost don't do it justice for how large these plates looked coming out. The only reason I am not giving Neptune 5 stars is due to the fact there was no lunch or smaller options. Our waitress informed us that even the appetizers and salads were quite filling. Since we weren't that hungry the oysters fit perfectly. In the future I would come back here for a dinner date or another pre-dinner raw seafood snack. Lastly, I don't know why I am calling it Neptune, it is Neptune Oyster.

Light.Sankaty Light Lager- Bar's recommendation when I asked for something light. It was alright. A little bit too bitter of an aftertaste but then again, I'm pretty sensitive to bitterness.Oysters! (duh)- They give you a handy dandy cheat sheet with all of the oysters' names, where they're from, their price, and a short description of their taste. Although whether the taste matches the description is pretty subjective.Island Creek (MA)- b's favorite. We did not find them as salty as they were described. Plump and juicy.Pemaquid (ME)- I liked these. Again, did not find them as salty as they were described. Plump.Browne's Point (ME)- Forgettable.East Beach Blonde (RI)- I really liked these from when I had tried them at Eastern Standard. Maybe I was tipsy at the time. They weren't as awesome as I remembered them. One was also super salty while the rest were moderately so. Fairly small in size.Summerside (PEI)- Forgettable as well.Lobster Roll (I chose to have it served hot and buttered on a toasted roll with fries)- It was good but I was expecting more what with the hype and the price tag. There were plenty of lobster chunks but they were a little bit too drenched in butter. Because of that, the roll, which wasn't very toasted to begin with, was somewhat soggy.Overall, it was kind of underwhelming.

I had read about the 3hour+ wait some people had experienced, and was trying to avoid that at all costs.We ordered 6 oysters, a hot lobster roll, and the clam chowder to split. First and foremost, Neptune has the best oyster selection and menu I have seen to date. I love how they have it in a list format, with the name of the oyster, where it comes from, price, and the taste/size. It's really helpful in picking out oysters that suit your tastes! The prices are very reasonable too, all in the $2something range. I don't like large oysters, and prefer the briny taste, so we ordered 2 Tatamagouche, 2 Weskeag, and 2 Kusshi. Each one was a winner! This was a much better oyster experience than my visit to Island Creek Oyster Bar because I knew exactly what I was picking. Like all the seafood I've experienced in Boston so far, the oysters were super fresh and delicious!The lobster roll was huge. Generous would be an understatement for the amount of lobster they stuffed into that roll. We got the hot variety, which came coated in butter instead of mayo. I had never heard of serving a lobster roll hot, so I wanted to try it out. It was ok, a bit chewier I think because it was hot, and super fresh of course. My bf appreciated this more than I did, but we both thought it was very good. The fries it came with were wonderfully seasoned and very crisp, just how I like it.The clam chowder was a big let down though. Since it is one of the popular menu items, I expected great things from the bowl. However, it was very thin and watery, and tasted more of potatoes than clams. I was so disappointed. And I absolutely love clam chowder too! I ended up just fishing out the clam bits, and leaving the soup and potatoes.

I overheard \"45 minutes\" and started considering the place 2 doors down advertising 'wicked lobsta' while HB went to put our names on the list. 10 minutes later they were calling our names. The hostess was a pro, calmly dealing with a line cutter as she directed us to the counter. It's a small little hole in the wall with a lot of character. Nothing fancy just a tin-roofed, old school, neighborhood joint. Don't let that fool you, there's a sophisticated seafood menu waiting for you to explore along with a raw bar stocked with all types of fresh clams and oysters. There's a solid selection of wines but I went with an IPA (or two) on tap.Honey Bunny had read that they had the best lobster roll in Boston and it would be hard to argue against that statement. They have it both ways, hot in butter or cold with mayo ($25 either way). I went with hot and that seemed to meet the approval of our host behind the bar. Honey Bunny ordered the Cioppino, a fish and shellfish spicy stew served over saffron rice, and splurged on adding Maine lobster to the mix. Pricey option (adds about $12) but again, worth it. Just the right amount of spicy according to HB. She prefers her giant shrimp sans heads and little feety things but gamely ripped the little buggers apart and went to town. A couple of pieces of fresh bread to sop all the stewy goodness and viola!, empty plate...er..bowl.My lobster roll did not disappoint. A large portion of sweet lobster meat covered in just enough butter to impart flavor but not overwhelm, piled into a large brioche roll. Served with fries that were good but not great.

As in if you want to eat at 8pm, come at 5pm...because that's what we did for our table of 6.Memorable Orders:Clam Chowder ($11) -The chowder is runny, like a slightly reduced cream. But the flavour profile is definitely impressive. Settled on the bottom of the soup are lots of cooked clams, potatoes, and other treasures. It's a good bowl of soup, but not the best chowder in the traditional sense.Maine Lobster Roll ($25) -This was definitely the best part of the meal. The lobster is served chunky instead of ground up, giving that good succulent seafood texture. Drizzled with warm butter and a soft roll, it is to die for!Cod ($35) - If you happen to come here on a Saturday, the cod is the special of the day which isn't on the regular menu. My advice? ORDER IT. I don't normally like cod but this was was a pleasant surprise. The fish was flakey and light at the touch of a fork, while still being firm when you bite through it. A nice light entree.Not-so-memorable Orders:Dayboat Scallop Crudo ($12) -For $12, this Dayboat Scallop Crudo was definitely underwhelming. Barely sharable, and it wasn't anything to write home about. Neptunes on Piggyback ($13) -crispy oysters, Berkshire pig, golden raisin confiture, pistachio aioli. It's a little bit of a confusing dish.

Such is the power of oysters and prosecco. In fact these two items are on my \"Last Meal\" Yelp profile list.I hoped I wasn't jinxing myself because I had an otherwise busy weekend planned and was not quite ready to kick the bucket despite how delicious the food and drink were.We followed the oysters with one of the now famed and much Yelped about hot buttered toasted lobster rolls which we split. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I could have very easily eaten the entire fabulous dripping with deliciousness whole thing.

It didn't take too long for our food to come out and when it did my eyes completely bugged out and my jaw fell to the floor! Huge mounds of lobster right before my eyes. They don't skimp out at all! We had a discussion on which was better: hot or cold and I'm still debating on which one I liked better. With the hot you get the nice lobster slathered in butter. With the cold you get not just standard mayo, they have some seasoning in there that I can't put my finger on. I think just by ease of eating, the cold one wins by a hair. The roll was a little soggy because of the butter so it was a little harder to eat. You can also order it without the roll but what's the fun in that?!

The raw oysters ($1.70-3.20 a pop) are bicoastal and superb, always expertly shucked with nary a grain of shell or sand. But you'd be missing out terribly if you didn't let the chef cook something for you, too.Every day of the week offers a new little revelation, some perfectly composed, beautifully plated dish with a streak of complex, deeply-flavored sauce. There's so much to love here, I hardly know where to begin: maybe the ham hock hash ($12), an appetizer of chewy, slightly gelatinous offal with beets, fingerling potatoes, a fried egg, and softly warmed goat cheese. Or a vitello tonnato ($16) turned into a sandwich, riffing on the classic Italian summer dish with roasted veal and tuna (here a tartare instead of the traditional poached), pepped up with a cucumber salad and spicy mustard. Terrific frites on the side are a big plus. To my utter amazement, the burger is actually fantastic, too.Specials of the day are generally amazing, like Monday's lobster spaghettini ($34), which features a lot of lobster meat in a rather spicy marinara with parsley and bread crumbs. I have a quibble with the lobster roll ($22): I find that the eggy, charred brioche overpowers the delicate, bulging pile of lobster meat in both styles: Connecticut, hot with melted butter, and Eastern New England, cold with a bit of mayo. But mostly I find this food transporting, if a big costly for everyday eating. I'm not surprised that nearly every time I dine here, some locally-famous chef is chowing down a few seats away. Unlike many North End places, Neptune actually deserves its nightly lines; all the more reason to go at lunch, when no one stands between you and its remarkable food.", "Date": "2008-01-07", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Ambrose C.", "ReviewID": "reJE6D6BD2P0JNlAT0TVJg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Are you looking for a quintessential and tasty New England seafood dish? Are you willing to wait a really long time to sit inside so you can order it? Are you willing to splurge a lot of money for it? If you said yes to all three questions, this place may have your answer. This place has been high on my list of restaurants to eat at in Boston and I finally found the right timing and opportunity to eat here. I took a friend to this place and here is what happened.We arrived at the restaurant at around 7:45 PM on a Saturday night, hoping that there would be less people, since they do not take reservations. The server said to me that it is going to be a two hour wait. This place has broke the record for the longest time I had to wait to eat in a restaurant. My expectations for the food made a significant jump from really low, to extremely high as my friend and I thought of ways to kill time while waiting as I gave the waitress my cell phone number.At around 9:55 PM we came back and a feeling of relief came when the waitress yelled out \"AMBROSE?!\" indicating that my friend and I got a spot to sit, even though it was at the bar. We quickly ordered the Maine Lobster Roll (both cooked with butter). Since I knew that I was not going to come back here for a long while, I also decided to order a piece of clam and a piece of oyster on the list and marked it. \u00a0The clam and oyster I ordered were the Cherrystone Clam and Island Creek Oyster. They were served in a tray covered in ice and came with some sort of cocktail sauce. The Cherrystone Clam was decently good. The meat in this clam was tasty due to the sauce and also had a nice juicy taste to it. I am not much of an oyster connoisseur, but I did not detect much of the fruity finish according to the description of the Island Creek Oyster. Although I had meatier and tastier oysters compared to eating the Island Creek Oyster, it was not disappointing at all. It was decently good, very soft and refined in terms of tastiness. I felt like a high class wealthy person as I held up the oyster and began to eat it.Finally, the Maine Lobster Roll. It arrived within a very short time frame, and it came with a huge pile of French Fries. As for the size of the Lobster Roll I would say that it is approximately 16 cm in length, but definitely under 30 cm using rough estimates. I took a piece of lobster from the roll and put it into my mouth. I closed my eyes and began to chew. My taste buds and palate communicated with me...\"YUM YUM YUM! Buttery, tender and meaty deliciousness! MMMMM... MMMMM.... MMMMMM!!!!\"Yeah, my taste buds and palate experienced a feeling of jubilant rapture from the buttery flavor and the meaty tenderness of the lobster. It was probably the best cooked and most delicious lobster I have eaten. The bread was okay, tasted almost like a hot dog roll that you would get from a supermarket, but the tasty butter just made the bread five times tastier. As for the French Fries, they were pretty tasty with the right amount of softness and saltiness that made fries typically addicting to eat. They were not memorable fries, but definitely several steps above fries that you would get from Wendy's. Ketchup was also tasty as well. My friend really loved the Lobster Roll here, and thought he had some of the best seafood here. However, he said that he would not have the lobster in a roll because he did not like the bread that much. As for service, it was okay, somewhat effective. I could see that my server was trying to be nice but he also seemed to be under a lot of pressure because he was handling so many people and orders. It does not appear to be easy working in one of the busiest restaurants in Boston so I was extremely nice to the people who work there.The WC (means \"Water Closet\", another term for a lavatory) was small but decently clean. There is a quote on a giant mirror above the toilet by prominent American author Ernest Hemingway, so you can get a dosage of some Hemingway to read if that interests you while using the lavatory. Overall, this is one representation of Boston's food at its finest. If you are going to be in Boston for a short period of time, and you are looking for a very worthy restaurant to splurge, this is a strong candidate. Just be prepared to have a lot of time to kill if the wait is going to be really long. Despite the long wait, I believe that I have eaten some of the best lobster in Boston so far and I'll never look at lobster rolls the same way again.", "Date": "2010-09-07", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Kat F.", "ReviewID": "99csuby7FQIVdDvCEWAMFg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm adding Neptune to my list of favourite dining experiences of all time.

Bear in mind that this review comes from the most unlikely of Neptune patrons - a VEGETARIAN. An actual vegetarian that doesn't eat seafood (don't get me started on people who profess to be vegetarians \"but also eat fish\"...). I thought I would be at a disadvantage in an oyster oasis like this, but it turns out I was in for the meal of a lifetime under the fine care of owner Jeff, who is a total sweetheart and a hotter version of CSI's Gil Grissom. It's true.We arrived at around 10pm on a Saturday night and the place was filled with diners. We started off with a few glasses of Albarinho and worked our way down the menu. Jeff, who I didn't even realize was the owner until I overheard someone asking him how long the place had been open, was incredibly humble and charming. I could not believe that the owner of a restaurant like this was behind the bar taking orders and serving us like a regular joe. After I told him I was vegetarian he asked me what I liked on the menu and then offered to make me a combo plate of the things I had picked, making a few suggestions along the way. At no point did I feel like I was going to have a meal that was any less awesome because it didn't have seafood in it - I had full trust that the food was going to be amazing and I was completely right.My plate (bowl, actually) arrived and was heaving with goodness - each item was perched on top of the next in a lovely display of coloured foods. There was the crispy gnocchi, which were boiled and then pan-fried like pierogies to give them a crunchy exterior, the green garlic broth kale with fresh peas, butternut squash puree & braised bok choy, apple slaw and avocado & grapefruit salad. Every last bite was incredibly yummy and unique in flavour and texture. I also loved the decor at Neptune - it was in a really nice part of the city that felt very European and cozy, and dark with soft lighting and a sort of sexy, jazzy feel to it.

This place has been bookmarked since my first week as a Bostonian--in August of 2010. Since bookmarking it, I built it up a bit in my head. I allow one lobster meal as a line item in my humble, monthly grad student budget.

I tried to get out here in October when my former colleagues were doing business in Cambridge. I almost got them here too!

This gal is probably the only person I know who loves lobster as much as I do (to be fair, I've only met one person from Maine) and she was the PERFECT occasion to go. She loves Legal Seafoods though. I had to tell her, \"Look, I know you love Legal. But I ain't taking you there. I'm a local now. I'm taking you where the locals go.\" Both of us were supremely happy with our hot, buttered lobster rolls. Holy eff, it is a massive mound of lobster.

A: Ain't gotta ask me twice.I've never been here, and it was high time I gave it a go. I'm kind of a picky eater when it comes to creature treats, but I will try anything from the ocean at least once. With such a tiny place and a no reservations policy, I knew coming at peak time on a weekend night was going to be a bit of a challenge. This was not an incorrect assumption. We considered scrapping the whole idea but some time spent at Goody G's took the edge off. We ended up waiting an hour and a half, which was exactly what we were told. We were finally seated by a little half cherub, half merbaby statue perched behind our seats who eyed our every movement with his languid, frozen gaze. The table arrangements here are not for those that long for privacy, you will no doubt get dragged into conversation by those around you. Just (lobster) roll with it. After our adult beverages were procured, we launched into our appetizer and raw bar orders. I got the Japanese octopus salad and the rest of the table got a nice sampling of oysters. I enjoyed my salad, though it didn't quite have the wow factor I thought it would. The little bit of citrus flavor that I did get was divine, just need to pump up the volume. Being the incredibly individualistic persons that we are, everyone got the hot lobster roll for our main course. Okay.Can I say, when you're about 2 prosecco glasses deep on a humid summer night a hot roll of rich meat is maybe not the best idea? Despite the awkwardness of eating such a thing in such conditions, it was really pretty good. Very buttery, if I go back and order again I may ask to go easy on it next time. The bread was good, and the portion was massive. And the fries. Oof. I can't even explain how good they were. We did not have to wait long for anything, service was swift but a little barebones. Kind of expected a bit more out of the place in that department.While it wasn't the religious experience some people like to rave about, I would definitely pay a visit again.

Artichoke salad - tangy and refreshing, with white anchovies adding a salty pungency. Kind of a grown up Ceasar,light and springy.New England Clam chowder - this was the biggest letdown. It was too thin, and too sweet, without any discernible clams. Skip it and eat something else. Oysters - In my food haze, I forgot to take notice of the ones we got, but they were all briny and very fresh.

I decided to cap off a week of good eating with lunch at Neptune Oyster. While tiny, Neptune is a cute space; subway tiles, a large mirrored menu, small tables, and a long wood bar. It reminds me of a Pottery Barn spread; you know the one where you wish you had enough money to replicate it, even the details and accents they're not hawking. It's not ideal for a groups of more than 4, I think there are only 6-8 tables in all. Also, I'm not sure I'd call this a great date place or at least a romantic one, at lunchtime it got quite loud.

The roll was light and airy, and seemingly dusted with melted butter. The lobster was teeming from the bun; huge hunks of fresh, delicious lobster; writing about it is making me salivate. Hand cut fries accompanied the roll, those were excellent too; perfectly salty and greasy, a nice accompaniment to the roll. I washed it all down with a Whale's Tale Pale Ale, my only misstep; it was recommended by my server, but I wasn't really a fan.

Although, hypothetically speaking, I recommend hitting up Maria's for baba rum, ricotta pie, and a napoleon... I ate at Neptune twice in two days (and hypothetically Maria's) and would have happily gone again if given extra resources and stomach space. I can't recommend one dish more highly than the next, but I can tell you everything I managed to stuff down my gullet while there.1. Hot lobster roll. Everyone around us was eating this dish, and every person licked their buttery plate clean, from the hot, soaked roll, to the huge, steaming, chunks of lobster, to the perfectly crisp heap of fries and ketchup on the side. The quest for 'best lobster roll in Boston' has effectively been terminated. Not to mention, the empowering feeling that accompanies combining a bite of really cheap food (fries) with really expensive food (lobster) is AWESOME. The best of both worlds is an understatement.2. Uni pasta. There is not nearly enough tubetti in the world, so the fact that this dish featured the tiny tubes immediately won my heart (or perhaps stomach). Between the light, savory, creamy sauce, green peas, morels, chewy little pastas, and uni so tender that chewing became superfluous, it only seemed natural that I eat this dish this twice in 24 hours. My one regret is not having it a third time.3. Johnny cakes. This dish was reminiscent of a bagel, lox & cream cheese on crack. Replace the bagel with a fluffy, chewy johnnycake topped with a sweet molasses-y glaze, the lox for a mound of trout tartare and black caviar, and the cream cheese for a dollop creme fraiche. The contrast of flavors and textures is pretty unique to this dish, and the sweet and salty ratio was perfect. I was craving it again the next morning (I mean, johnny cakes are breakfast food...)4. Ciopinno - An octopus's dream come true. Juicy lobster, heaps of clams and mussels, prawns with heads in tact, and cubes of silver skinned salmon over saffron rice in a spicy broth. I suppose saffron rice doesn't apply to an octopus's dream come true, but aside from that, this entree was just a melange of perfectly prepared, high quality seafood... and besides, everyone loves sucking the juices out of a prawn head. If you're conflicted about which undersea morsel to consume, the ciopinno lets you have it all.In a nutshell, try anything and everything that appeals to you.

Namely, I didn't know it was so honking popular, and I didn't know it was so honking popular for its lobster rolls.Turns out I still did okay - after a second visit, I can say with confidence that the crown jewel of this New England seafood mecca is the juicy, meaty Neptuneburger.Neptune does not take reservations, and apparently showing up at 7:30 on a Thursday was very naive. \u00a0We went to Daily Catch instead and came back before noon the next day. \u00a0Had we come any later, we would have met the same fate.Our party of four sat at the counter and managed to dine family style without too much difficulty. \u00a0The service was reasonable enough, and the food came out fast.The food was delicious. \u00a0We started with oysters and an octopus cocktail. \u00a0The oyster menu is expansive and seasonal, and every oyster I've had has been superb. \u00a0This time I enjoyed a firm, crisp Kusshi and a larger, briny Wellfleet that had a great sweet finish. \u00a0The octopus cocktail was likewise tasty and refreshing, with top notch seafood and clean ceviche flavors.We shared two Maine lobster rolls, the bronzini, and a Neptuneburger. \u00a0Neptune is known for the lobster rolls, and we tried both the hot and cold versions, which came with butter and mayo, respectively. \u00a0They were $25 each and while they were scrumptious, so was the $13 roll at James Hook. \u00a0But that isn't a real complaint - the serving of lobster was generous, and both preparations showed strength in the sheer quality of the meat. \u00a0Robed in butter, the hot lobster roll boasts pure, satisfying flavors and a nice meatiness to the huge chunks of lobster. \u00a0The mayo on the cold roll was just enough to bind, and though the cold was not equal to the hot, it was quite nice. \u00a0One actual gripe is that the rolls were just not exciting. \u00a0Even the plain hot dog buns were a missed opportunity (for more butter, mainly).The whole grilled bronzini was a fabulous entree, with a delicate texture to the fish. \u00a0It didn't yield to the fork in flakes, but it wasn't mushy, either. \u00a0It was served alla cinque terre, with basil pesto, fingerlings, and fennel salad, in a shallow pool of tomato-olive broth. \u00a0The flavors were broad and soothing. \u00a0But the winner was still the Neptuneburger, that juicy cheddar cheeseburger with fried oysters, garlic mayo, and that irresistible relish. \u00a0Forget seafood for a second. \u00a0Choose meat.Everything is great, though, and I don't actually recommend forgoing the incredible array of fresh seafood. \u00a0Get your lobster roll (hot), and get your burger on top. \u00a0And if you want to eat at all, show up early.", "Date": "2011-06-21", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Elizabeth S.", "ReviewID": "JzIjGMCgyrfrNU6FzNcoYg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Holy mackerel... and oysters, hot buttered lobster rolls, fresh clams, etc.Now that's good.We started off with a dozen oysters and a half-dozen raw clams. The stars of the raw bar in my opinion were the Kumamoto and the Moon Shoal. I also deeply enjoyed the Summerside. All three types were the perfect amount of briny, plump and sweet. Both the cherrystone and little neck clams were tasty, but we preferred the little necks.For our appetizers, we opted for the clam chowder and the Neptunes on Piggyback. The clam chowder was not the traditional Boston clam chowder we know and love; it was creamier and filled with large, meaty clams, and I enjoyed every bite. The Neptunes on Piggyback were tasty, with fried oysters atop a sort of pork p\u00e2t\u00e9 on a crostini, but the part that transformed the fine dish into a delight was the golden raisins.Finally, for the chef d'oeuvre: we've heard the burger is good, and the trout and scallops both looked tasty, but we knew we just couldn't leave without trying the glorified hot butter lobster roll. Best lobster roll in town? Of course. Best lobster roll I've ever had? Definitely. It was pure lobster meat - I was clearly eating the claws and tails, drizzled in hot butter and cradled in a butter and lobster-soaked soft bun.I paired my meal with a Muscadet, and he had a Guinness, as the poster on the wall correctly suggested that the stout is a perfect complement to lobster. Other patrons had cava or bellinis, which both looked refreshing.I found the oyster selection different from but as equally varied as Island Creek Oyster Bar's. ICOB has cheaper Island Creeks, so I'd recommend ordering only the oysters you can't find at ICOB at Neptune's raw bar. Most of Neptune's oysters had pieces of shells in them, which is a miss I've never found at ICOB. So for oysters, ICOB might win. For lobster rolls? Neptune, no contest.Time saver: there was no line as I entered this seafood mecca at 11:30 on a Sunday, and the line didn't start forming until I waddled out about an hour later, so I'd recommend Sunday lunch for anyone hoping to avoid a line.When I return, I'll likely skip the appetizers, double the amount of oysters, and order a lobster roll to share, as this rich treat is possibly best shared between two, assuming you don't merely want to pass out in a food coma after your meal.", "Date": "2011-10-16", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Irene L.", "ReviewID": "1-VED6Pu62jgAWco4RE-GQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Neptune Oyster is def. one of my fave restaurants in Boston.

But after several high-end meals, we just wanted something good (cough, cheaper). It had been recommended to me we try Union Oyster House for oysters but then I got the real deal from Ben G. He said we had to try Neptune for the lobster roll. He made it sound so amazing and I couldn't stop thinking about it. He did think one other might be better for oysters (B&G Oysters) but I was chasing the lobster roll dream.I started with four Island Creek oysters ($2.50 an oyster/ $10 total) and then the lobster roll ($25). Did I say something about this not being a fancy pants meal? Yeah, well, it was definitely getting there.Heck, the fish tacos here are $23! Pretty outrageous. Of course, once I got there, I was highly attracted to the idea of the sturgeon with lentils but no, I couldn't leave without that lobster roll. The gay boyfriend had the burger with relish on the side. He also ordered the clam chowder ($11) which took a bit of time but it's made to order.I loved my oysters and really thought about trying more out but since the server said the Island Creeks were her fave, I was momentarily satisfied with a spoonful of the clam chowder which was definitely awesome. Loved the fresh herbs in it.Then our food came. I could not believe how much lobster there was! I got it poached in butter and not mayo. Either way, it probably was a heart attack on a plate.

Here, I'll show you where it is...\"So emphatic was the rotund Faneuil Hall pub bouncer about \u00a0the quality of the lobster rolls at Neptune that he'd personally escorted us - cig still burning in hand - all the way to the edge of the throughway that faces off with the North End. He pointed out the entrance to Salem Street, the infamous culinary artery of the best Little Italy in the world. We started towards it.\"GO...THEY TASTE LIKE A PAIR OF DOUBLE Ds!!!\" he shouted after us. With this echoing endorsement, we went from walking to running towards the establishment despite the comment's general vulgarity and logical strangeness (just think of an analogical statement for a heterosexual female to make, and in reference to a lobster roll?!).The compact ground floor space was lit up by soft-hued electric lights to evoke a grotto - an aesthetic standout in the midst of the more traditional decor of neighboring pasta and canoli houses. The paneled ceiling was like a giant bar of white chocolate, raised with ornate and antique patterns.Sadly, the cozy scale inside (15-seat bar, 27-seat banquette) meant that there was no space at the inn for us. There were three of us and only two empty stools at the shiny bar, so my resourceful girlfriend located another stool in the back and dragged it forth. She was stopped by a server, who told her she couldn't just move furniture around as she pleased, and that even the bar spots were earmarked for the arrival of others. (On a President's Day Monday night at 8:30 p.m. at a no-reservations place?)This resulted in my friend shrilling about the elitist bullshit of the place and the bitchiness of \"that elitist bitch,\" so her man and I quietly ushered her into Rabia's down the block. There, we sat deliberating over the strange lobster roll variations (involving toppings of bleu cheese and onion) and grumbling about the $24.95 price until the server covering the empty floor chirped that they were clear out of lobster rolls anyhow.Back to Neptune we went. This time, there were three seats at the bar. We asked a different server if it was okay to sit, and suddenly it was. Ordering was easy because it was only a matter of choosing between butter and mayonnaise dressings. Here, the price was $25 even. For someone who grew up in New England and has therefore scored plenty of snapping-fresh rolls in many points North for less than half the price, a QUARTER OF A HUNDRED BONES was a tough fare to choke down. But I did it anyway, recalling the bouncer's enthusiastic advertisement.Our rolls arrived quickly. A fair portion of butter-drizzled claw and tail meat - slightly too well done for my taste - was embedded in a fluffy but otherwise non-remarkable bun. It was good, but not arousingly so. After all, it's a G.D. LOBSTER ROLL.Between our hard won (or bought) mouthfuls, we stared up at a chalkboard displaying an impressive variety of local and Pacific oysters with prices like 2 9/10...per shell. Still, my NYC price goggles easily had me considering a couple Kumamotos from Washington but I decided to save my dizzough for when I'm actually out in the Pacific Northwest.We asked for the check, got it, and paid up. My card was charged twice, so we called the server back. She wasn't particularly apologetic and seemed more hassled, but promised that she'd fix the problem and that I wouldn't see two charges on my account. \"Good, or else I'll be making a phone call,\" I said obnoxiously, breaking into laughter with my friends...because what would a night in an Italian neighborhood in Boston be without empty threats? She turned around with a look on her face like she wished she could scratch my eyes out. Anyway, the moral of the story seems to be: If you want lobster rolls, go to Woodman's in Essex MA or to Jack's in Hampton Beach, NH or some shack in Maine (not NYC, which skimp on me no matter what) or anywhere in between. Or go to any Market Basket between Mass. and Maine in season, get some steamed ones and make your own. If you want seafood in Beantown, don't be above going to an Irish pub near Faneuil ($13-$15) or to Legal Seafoods (standard MP). If you want special oysters, get closer to their beds, or hit up B&G for a more focused hunt.If you want crowded old world nooks with alternately sassy or warm service from young girls or grandmas, THEN come to the North End, but note that pasta or pastries will provide a cheaper and more congruous experience.In Neptune-land, a placid (i.e. NOT my girlfriend) out of towner might be wowed, and a gastro-snob with a bankroll to burn on accompaniments of fine wine without crying (reportedly: Bennifer Affleck, Flea, The Edge, Leo, Kelly Clarkson, JT) might be deliberately under radar.

We went around 7 PM on a very very cold and rainy Sunday, and we were happily surprised that as soon as we walked in there were a few seats at the bar and at a table available.What made this a five-star experience was the service. I felt like the server truly wanted to make sure we had a great time, and when I told him about my allergy, he patted my shoulder and assured me that he would take care of it personally. We asked for recommendations on everything, and he was not afraid to speak up about his personal faves and suggestions. So on his word, we had a few glasses of white wine and started off with the smoked tuna johnnycake. Wow. It tasted a bit like a fancy bagel with lox, but it was so much more complex than that - the salty fish with the sweetness of the cake was a great combination. I could eat it for days!For entrees, Pete had a dozen oysters, all on the recommendation of our amazing server (I wish I had gotten his name! He is such a nice person!!), and I had to get the lobster roll, just to find out what everyone has been raving out. When it came out, it became immediately apparent.

Apparently that is the straw that breaks the camels back and causes Defcon-1 at Neptune Oyster. I guess when the line can't just scoop cold lobster into a hot dog bun and they actually have \u00a0to cook, god forbid, everything falls apart.I ordered a half dozen oysters while I looked over the menu. The oysters came out promptly and were quite good. I then went ahead and placed my order and found out that lobster rolls were sold out. I should have left but after waiting 45 minutes to get \"the call\" I decided to stay and ordered tuna meatballs and scallops. The crispy tuna meatballs were OK, I have had better. They were defiantly lacking in flavor. Just seemed to be missing something. My plate was cleared and this is were things went down hill. I sat, and sat, and sat, and sat some more. The bartender then came over to tell me that my tuna meatballs would be right out. Ummmm I have been done with those for a good 20 minutes now you chooch. I then proceeded to wait close to an hour for an order of scallops to come out that were way over salted.It was totally unacceptable and to top it off when I mentioned to the bartender that I had been waiting an hour for an order of 4 scallops he chuckled a little and said to me, \"No, you haven't.\" I have worked in many restaurants over the years and have had problems with ticket times but have never laughed in a guests face and told them that they haven't waited that long. Total amateur hour stuff right there.Goodbye Neptune it was nice knowing you. Like a crazy ex-girlfriend you won't be missed.If you go on a night when they are out of lobster just get up and leave.

Let me first explain that my low rating comes as a warning.I love their warm lobster rolls and oysters. But I've always gone during the weekend and in the evening. Though the wait has been hours (best spent by going to a dive bar or having a cannolli dessert first), it's been great. Today I went after the lunch time rush. We were first seated at the bar, but later moved to a table because the AC was blowing right on us. Well, the problem was that at neither the bar nor the table did we get any service, even though we watched the two waiters chatting it up with some what I assume as regulars at the end of the bar. That'd be okay if it wasn't at the sacrifice of the service for the rest of us. My glass of soda water was never replenished. We were never asked how things were (where my dad, visiting from Michigan, was missing utensils after the move and just went on sharing a napkin with me). And worst was when our oysters never came. We moved to the table just in time to receive our entrees. When we told the waiter to make sure the oysters weren't on the bill, she said it was because of our move that she missed the oysters. SHE BLAMED US, TO OUR FACES even though the oysters should have already come to us! She even bad-talked about us to the other waiter! I was shocked. Look, I would say that before this stop, I would and have given Neptune 5 stars. But on the merits of just this visit, I was insulted and really considered giving 1 star.

And to top it off I think I got food poisoning!!!!! My mom and I arrived at Neputne Oyster on a rainy Friday afternoon around 1:30pm and the place was packed! The restaurant is extremely small that you have to share tables with strangers. The wait staff doesn't even bother separating the tables out a little bit b/c there just isn't any space. And to make the lack of square footage even worse, camera crews were pacing back and forth filming a TV series for the Food Network (which was kind cool if the food was actually up to par). Okay....so I'll eliminate the service aspect of Neptune Oyster from this review since it wasn't an ordinary restaurant day b/c Food Network was filming. So..onto the main topic..THE FOOD! Between my mom and I we ordered Kumanoto oysters, Littenecks, shrimp cocktail, the hot lobster roll and the Vitello Tonnato sandwich. The Kumanotos were about $2.90 each and they tasted really fresh, however, I had got really sick after we left the restaurant. \u00a0I've had my share of raw foods at various restaurants and different parts of the world, and this is the first time I've had this happen to me. So you've all been warned...I've never seen shrimp cocktail the size of my palm, but unfortunately, in this case bigger isn't better. The cocktail shrimps were overcooked which made the texture of the shrimp way too firm. FAIL! And as for the hot lobster roll, I was not impressed whatsoever. For $25 I expected a lot more. I agree with the other reviews that the roll was overflowing with lobster, but the bun was not toasted and our lobster roll was definitely not \"hot\", at best our roll was lukewarm. I was thoroughly disappointed when I took my first bite. If I'm going to eat a lobster roll dipped in butter I would expect to taste the butter. Our roll lacked everything I expected it to encompass. FAIL! I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try something that didn't necessarily sound appetizing. I ordered the Vitello Tonnato sandwich which was served with tuna tartare, roasted veal with a cumber salad inside. I thought I would try to let my palate experience different things, but this sandwich made a statement to my taste buds to never mix fish and veal in sandwich. The textures did not merry well and it was just a weird combination. I think the sandwich would have been better off just the tuna tartare and the cucumber salad. Also, the sandwich had way too much roasted veal and it masked the freshness of the tuna tartare. Again...FAIL! I'm sure after reading this review, you know what I'm going to say. Don't waste your time with Neputne Oyster because it's overrated and there's a pretty high chance you might get sick.

I've heard about this place and saw it the other night on Chronicle and decided that I had to give a try, because I love oysters. No one was around to go with me, so I decided to go it alone. I have no problem going to a place to eat lunch by myself, especially in the North End. You always end up talking to someone. Because its not a very big place, I decided to go at about 2pm for a late lunch to miss the crowds. However, because of all its recent publicity, in The Boston Globe, Chronicle and soon the TV Food Network, I did have to wait about 10 minutes, but it wasn't a bad wait at all.While line, I ended up talking with two very nice women, a mother and daughter who were in Boston for a day trip and and older couple. All at the same time a table and three seats at the bar opened, so the older couple took the table and myself and the other two ladies in line sat together at the bar. The restaurant itself looks like something out of the 40's. White tile, dark wood, old style fixtures etc. Very nice, comfortable feel to it. Clean, but not cold. They have a wide variety of oysters to choose from. I really liked how they give you a list with the name of the oyster, origin, the price of each, their size and accurate taste description of each oyster. You just go down the list and put a the number of oysters you want next to its name. Its almost a cross between a sushi order sheet and a wine list. I wanted to compare several different varieties of oysters, because I compare all to the Welfleet oyster. I was raised on those. So I ordered a few Welfleet, a few Katama bay, Kumamoto- from WA, and a Pemaquid from ME and a few cherrystones for good measure. I have to say that the description given on their order sheet is very accurate. For example, they describe the Kumamoto oyster as \"Sm. sweet, plump, creamy, with hints of honeydew melon.\" Yeah I know, honeydew melon?! Well I'll be danmed! It did have a honeydew tasting finish on it! LOL! Unreal The ladies next to me had Neptune's famous hot buttered lobster roll and it looked great! They were both very pleased with it. If you have eat a lobster roll with a knife and fork- isn't really a bad things. Lots of glistening buttered lobster meat in a beautifully buttery toasted roll. They were great company as well. Thank ladies!I would have like to have tried their clam chowder, but they only offer it by the bowl. I \u00a0couldn't have finished a whole bowl. I would have liked just a cup with my raw bar treats, That would have been perfect. I also think they should give that poor bartender a raise or little extra help now thru the holidays. She was slammed. No one just drinks at this bar. She was the bartender, server, cashier, informant, buser, etc and she handled it all very well and with grace, but if that were me I \u00a0would have told the owner if he left me out to dry like that again I would quit. But again, she never complained, just apologized for any wait and just kept moving right along. She was like a machine.Also BONUS for pulling the Guinness in three pours.

The lobster chowder was incredible - with a thick blended veggie base to not overdo you with heavy cream. Local (Verril Farm) ingredients were noticeably fresh.After reading much praise of the lobster rolls, each of those had to be done. So as not to have a duplicate meal, I went with the roasted veal/tartar sandwich. Hot lobster roll - its just like eating a lobster with butter, without any effort. My preference is cold - and it was every bit as delicious, with just the right amount (not much!) of mayo. The rolls were of course a great match - not lame Wonder bread - Neptune's toasty brioche is THE winner here. The veal/tuna exceeded every one of my excpectations. Served on fantastic thick toasty bread, the sandwich was piled high with meat. The cucumber salad and mustard are in there, but only really noticeable when you start chowing down. The coolness and spice work in an amazing way with the crazy fresh tuna and warm, tender roast veal. The sandwiches are all full meals - while served with some delicious fries (really great, dark, crunchy, with skin and nicely seasoned), the sandwiches were filling enough that no one finished their fries.Great service, never pushy and always there to top off your water.

Glidden Point Raw Oysters- Medium/ Plump size/ very high salt/ citrus finish- also excellent with beer3. Kumamoto Raw Oysters- small/ sweet oysters- but guess what also great with beer4.

As such, I had high hopes when I suggested it to my mother who flew in to Boston to celebrate Mother's Day. Everything I'd heard about Neptune's was about the same: \"it's worth the wait.\"I'd hoped that by arriving around 6, we'd beat the dinner rush, but even so we were told that the wait for a party of two was 45 minutes. We wandered the North End a bit, but spent a majority of our 1 hour and 15 minute wait huddled inside the Neptune entrance. When seated, we ordered a dozen Cherrystone clams, the hamachi ceviche, and the gold coast red snapper. My mother asked for a hot water with lemon, her customary drink order, but was informed that hot beverages were not an option. From what I could surmise, the beverage selection ranges from wine to water and nothing in between.There's no question that our food was absolutely delicious. The clams, with lemon and sauces, were delightful. The ceviche, though not what expected (it was really more along the lines of strips of fish with sauces laid on a plate) was lovely, and the red snapper was one of the tastiest dishes I've had in some time. I rate Neptune Oyster only 2 stars because the food, while delicious, did not make up for the exaggerated wait time, the cramped and noisy seating situation, the lack of choices, and the high prices.

An old high school friend and I decided to try to beat the Friday night dinner rush and showed up at the restaurant at 5 PM. As soon as I walked in, I realized why the place is known for its wait - the restaurant is tiny! There were probably a maximum of 30-40 seats in the whole place, and this was with minimal open floor space. Regardless, I had heard too much about the lobster roll to walk away and the waitress was kind enough to take down our cell number so we didn't need to wait in the restaurant. About 10-15 minutes later, a surprisingly short wait, we got a call and headed back to be seated at the bar. First we started with a single oyster each - my friend got one from MA and I got one from NB (described as med size, med salt, with a champagne finish). Neither of us are really oyster connoisseurs so I can't say if the oysters were very different from the fresh ones I had just eaten at the Haymarket outside but unless my tastes become much more sophisticated, I probably won't be paying $2.70 for an oyster again. I had a small debate over whether I should try the cioppino but ultimately followed through with my original plan to order the hot butter lobster roll with a side of salad rather than fries. The very first bite was DELICIOUS, meaty, buttery, warm, and good. However, I have to question the $25 price. I haven't had many lobster rolls so I'm not sure how this one compares but I hardly think that substituting mayo with butter and heating the roll a bit should constitute a doubling in price. Adding butter generally makes everything taste good - so I wonder how difficult this actually is to make with the right ingredients. Also, the butter seeped into the bread and made the bottom half a bit soggy. Perhaps toasting the bread would help with this problem. Finally, the salad that came with it had a pretty presentation of lettuce leaves arranged as a flower but the vinaigrette was overwhelmingly salty.All that aside, I still really enjoyed my experience at Neptune Oyster and was very sad to come to the end of my lobster roll.

Neptune Oyster is possibly the most perfect spot for this here Yelper.Located on the edge of the North End (Boston's Little Italy), this place is easy to get to, but not easy to park close by - we had to valet the car at a different restaurant and walk a couple blocks to the tiny but wonderful Neptune.Walk through heavy curtains keeping the cold out, and then through another door, into simple seafood paradise. With only a few high tables and the bar, Neptune seems to crowd easily, but that's part of the fun. If you're a small party (we were three) and it's full, you might make nice with your fellow diners sitting at the same table, but don't fret: these patrons are Boston's desirables, so you're in good company. The atmosphere buzzes with either excited or already satisfied customers and proud, sociable, attentive servers.Everything on the menu looks delicious, and the daily specials are not to be missed, so our table summoned 18 oysters, two orders of the lobster spaghettini (Monday's special), one order of seared scallops atop braised pork shoulder, and an order of fried clams, in that order. I could rant and rave about the flavors for pages, but for brevity's sake I'll simply mention that I haven't had better, well, anything! I could return and have the exact same meal time and again, never tiring of the deliciousness.To quench one's thirsty cravings, Neptune serves up some of my favorite beer, which can pretty much only be found in Massachusetts: the Whale's Tale Pale Ale from Cisco Brewery, which is located on a favorite island, Nantucket. While the ale pairs well with oysters and fried clams, the spaghettini and scallops called for something deep, red, and decanted. Though surprisingly small, and not as Italian as one might expect, the wine list sports some decent bottles, and the reserve list (called \"Pearls\") is, while equally limited, aptly named. After trying for a Brunelo, then a Barbaresco, there was finally a Barolo in stock. Not what I'd initially wanted, but who can complain about a Barolo?

This is the only place that I am willing to wait for a hour to be seated, and to feel lucky, that I am sitting at a table and at not the bar. \u00a0If I could eat shellfish all day here, I would. (And if I had the money...). Many choices from the raw bar.... and all very fresh. If you come here for lunch, get the warm butter lobster roll. Sooo much scrumptious lobster in a bun. Each time I order the roll, I look at the plate and say \"Oh, wow, so much food, I won't be able to finish it this time,\" but without fail, I devour it like a gluttonous beast. Everytime. It's a phenomenon that continues to baffle me. If I'm feeling healthy, I get the bib lettuce salad instead of the the fries. The scallops, an entree recently added earlier this year, are seared to perfection and taste phenomenal on top of a creative bed of greens, pomengranate, and duck confit. The foie-wich is one of my favorite appetizers. But beware, it is deceivingly filling, so be sure to share. Each bite is heavenly...The only thing I do not recommend is the oyster burger. It is quite underwhelming for a specialty seafood burger, as the oyster becomes completely lost in the mess of cheddar, garlic mayo, meat, and batter. It's like a treasure hunt on your palette... with sadly no prize in the end. All in all, I always look forward to dining here. I like how they have a small, consistent, set menu with daily specials. If I have any room left after dinner, I always try to grab a ricotta florentine cannoli at Mike's Pastry. Mm you can never have too much buttery, cheesy, artery clogging goodness.

The Triton Plateau was more than enough to sample all of the fresh seafood that Neptune Oyster has to offer. The clumps of lobster and crab in the salad were huge. Oysters and clams were freshly shucked and tasted like they were fresh from the Boston Harbor. The shrimp cocktail were the biggest shrimp I have seen, which had the sweet taste of fresh shrimp. The Clam Chowder was very flavorful, but a little but too water for my taste. And finally, the Lobster Roll hot with butter. The fresh toasted roll was stuffed with a large amount of huge chucks of lobster and topped with hot butter. It was also served with season French fries, which were also delicious.

There's a cozy coffee shop a few doors down that you can wait at. The restaurant itself has a bit of an at the docks feel decorated with posters of various kinds of fish. Oysters: first place I tasted oysters and now hooked. The raw bar has both local and those from father afield. Sitting at the bar you can watch them shuck the oysters and watch passerbys peer into the restaurant to stare at them. Fresh and served with lemon and a cocktail sauce topped with a bit of garlic in truffle oil--yum.Neptune on Piggyback: fried oysters topping pork belly. The whole meal was so not kosher, but so, so delicious. Scallops: delicious scallops-perfectly seared on the outside. They come on a base of potato puree topped with a bed of brussels sprouts, chanterelles, and some more pork belly. Lobster Roll: get it hot with butter--it practically melts in your mouth. This is the lobster roll to measure others by. The previous time I went, we had the clams as well, brought on accident, which they comped. Also, delicious.

The prices where what you'd expect at 2-4 dollars an oyster.The order came pretty quick, and the oysters were superbly fresh. I was also given back the order form along with the oysters so I could know which ones we were eating. This was a hugely appreciated, and in my experience unprecedented. I really liked having my cheat sheet as we tried each one.At 27.62 for two beers and 6 oysters it was pricy; but compared to what people around us were ordering, this was a remarkably small order.

The first thing we decided to do was eat. With my spreadsheet of Yelped places to eat in hand, we headed to Neptune Oyster. It's a small place and gets crowded easily. There was no room for us to wait in the restaurant either, but for our 30-45 min. wait we just browsed the shops around the area. We didn't have to worry about staying close since they took down our number and called us once our table was ready (this was awesome and I wish more places would use this method!).We ordered a dozen West Coast Oysters from the raw bar. The names escape me at the moment but the 2 kinds we ordered were delicious and extremely fresh! Then came our main meal - we each decided on ordering the Hot Maine Lobster Roll ($25). At first I was undecided between ordering it cold (served with Mayo) or hot (served with Butter). We asked the waitress what most people order and she said it was pretty much split down the middle and just depends on what you're in the mood for. I finally joined my 2 girls in their hot orders. The Lobster Roll was AMAZING to say the least. It came out on a toasted roll with large heaping pieces of fresh, juicy, delicious Lobster falling out of the roll. The butter made the roll that much more enjoyable! It also came with a side of fries. We were stuffed after our meal and that Lobster Roll turned our whole trip around!

Try some oysters. Get there early. While most prefer the hot-with-butter option, I actually like both the hot and cold versions equally, but they definitely are different. The chilled (huge) chunks of lobster in the cold sandwich are tossed with a light and barely perceptible layer of mayo, just enough to give it some extra flavor. Chilling the lobster also gives it a bit of a different and firmer texture, making it taste a bit more 'substantial.' That's not to say that the hot lobster roll wasn't swoonworthy, because it definitely was. Melted butter + lobster = infinite WIN. Go with someone else, and try both hot and cold. Die happy.

You get a lot of lobster... not just enough to fill the bun, but enough to REQUIRE eating a good number of fork-fulls before picking the damn thing up and trying to take a bite out of it. \u00a0Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way, and ended up spilling about a tail's-worth of lobster meat onto my plate when I tried to take a bite from the get-go.2. Each goes really well with a beer, preferably something that can stand up to the natural butteriness of the lobster meat. \u00a0I suppose you could get a nice acidic white, but a nice New England draught (Geary's Winter Ale at Neptune and Tremont Ale at B&G) seemed like the perfect accompaniment to me.Differences:1. B&G: \u00a0cold lobster in a light aioli with lemon and chives sprinkled on top. \u00a0The lemon gave the dish the perfect amount of acid to balance the lobster. \u00a0Not really mayonnaise-y at all. \u00a0Lobster chunks broken up to just the right size so when you take a bite out of the roll, you don't have to chew through a piece of lobster or get an overly large piece in your mouth.2. Neptune: \u00a0warm lobster in butter on a toasted brioche bun. \u00a0The warmth allowed me to fully enjoy all the natural (and added) butteriness of the lobster. \u00a0Often times large chunks of lobster that were obviously crab or tail meat. \u00a0While a bit harder to eat, the large chunks gave me the impression that there was some dude in the back who cracked open a fresh lobster, chopped it up a bit, put it in the bun and splash some butter on it.The service in each place was great. \u00a0The decor was a bit different, with Neptune sporting marble tables and an old-school oyster bar feel, while B&G had a more modern touch with a nice open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant where you can watch them do their magic.Both of these places are must-go's, even if you only like lobster a wee little bit. \u00a0I'll be back next time I'm in town, but I think I'll bring some cholesterol-lower medications just in case...", "Date": "2007-11-09", "Author_Location": "Oakland, CA"}, {"Author": "lily l.", "ReviewID": "_0NXQ66coVMcjyZawQDJSQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So.

New England Clam Chowder - not as thick or buttery as most new England clam chowders, but still very hearty and the seafood flavors were much more distinct in this chowder. I could really taste the clams, which were large and tender. The firm chunks of potatoes and celery also added a nice contrast to the texture. Oysters and Sea Urchin - they have one of the largest oyster selections I've ever seen, and I appreciated the helpful descriptions listed on their menu for each oyster (e.g. nutty finish, sweet pea taste, salty, sweet, size, etc). The Wellfleet and Kusshi oysters were my favorite. \u00a0The sea urchin was good, but wasn't that creamy. Warm Buttered Lobster Roll - heaping with warm, sweet buttery meat from a 1 \u00a01/2 lobster in a toasted roll...straightforward and perfectly executed. It's also served with a generous portion of fries - because the fat from all the butter isn't unhealthy enough, of course. \u00a0:-)Lobster Stroganoff with Wild Mushrooms - again, they don't skimp on their seafood here...there was more lobster than pasta in this stroganoff. And because they use cr\u00e8me fraiche instead of sour cream, the sauce was less tangy and enhanced the sweetness of the lobster meat. The egg noodles were delicate, while the flavors were rich and earthy. Admittedly, I thought the dish could have used a little more salt or something else to perk it up. It's a huge portion, so I got kind of bored half-way through it - although my husband loved this stroganoff and happily finished the rest. \u00a0Overall, I really liked the unfussy personality and plethora of seafood at Neptune Oyster.

We came back when they called us, and three of us promptly ordered the hot lobster roll with our very accommodating server, who said of course we wanted the lobster rolls. My brother ordered the cioppino, a seafood stew of everything *but* lobster (though you can request it for an additional $10). Lobster rolls arrived stuffed and overflowing with fresh chunks of lobster meat, coated in the right amount of butter: decadently, but not overpoweringly buttery. The toasted brioche buns were the perfect bread for the roll. Now here's where the service gets a gold star. The cioppino is served with rice-- but, our server said, the dish in his opinion \"screams for\" a side of bread as well. So he took it upon himself to include that with the order. Say what?

I agree with other reviews that have noted slow service and high prices. But here's the thing--I don't mind long lunches or dinners (in some circumstances) and I definitely don't mind paying high prices for fabulous food. Granted, I won't go regularly since I'm living on a grad school budget, but for a splurge, it's great. First tip: if you sit at the bar, things tend to move a little faster. You're right in front of them so there's no ignoring an empty dish or glass.Second tip: Even if you're not a huge fan of eating an entire meal full of raw seafood (like I do), Neptune Oyster has wonderful alternatives for you--particularly their daily specials in the corner of the menu. I sampled my boyfriend's fish and chips (he's one of those who doesn't live off raw seafood) and it was honestly the best I've ever had. It was an ACTUAL filet of fish instead of those pathetic pieces they normally fry up for fish and chips. It was perfectly battered and the fries were awesome. I was really, really surprised that they did such a good job with it.I've had a various assortment of the oysters they offer plus the clam chowder, hamachi, and a few other random entrees. I'm allergic to lobster and crab--so I can't attest to that myself. I can only repeat rave reviews from my parents when they last came with me.The oysters are always amazing. Super fresh, absolutely the best quality and always presented well. I order extra kumamodo (sp??) and kusshi. I'm a huge fan of the small, plump oysters that are less briny than the bigger ones. But I'll eat (and appreciate) any oyster. I could literally eat an entire meal of those two oysters alone with a glass of white wine and be the happiest person in the world.The clam chowder isn't everything I hoped it would be. It has great quality ingredients and the clams are wonderful but the soup was a little thin for me. But that might just be personal preference.Whatever fabulous sea bass concoction was offered the second time I was there with my boyfriend....oh my god. Insanely delicious. The fish just melted in your mouth. I believe it also came with a polenta that made my day.Hamachi--always a winner. Beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.Triton platter--supposedly incredible. My parents split it during my most recent visit and I, sadly, could not partake...but they talked about it through the night and into the next day. The lobster salad was a huge winner, as were the mussels, clams and oysters. The shrimp were HUGE. Oh dear lord were they big. And supposedly also quite good. Needless to say, I was insanely jealous. The trick to Neptune Oyster is to not go during extended peak hours. Go for lunch (same menu, smaller crowd) or around 9ish if you can stand a late dinner. Personally, I love long lunches so I love going (when I can, obviously), in the early afternoon and just eating as much as humanly possible. Maybe that's what made the slower table service more acceptable my last visit. It was also only one waitress for the whole restaurant and she tried to be as attentive as possible so I respect her for that. I've also never, ever had a problem with any of the staff at the restaurant. They have always treated me with respect and have been very friendly through the meal.Final tip: Put your name in when you're not hungry, wander around the great little shops in the area, then indulge when they call you. Don't expect to immediately get in. It's a tiny, tiny restaurant and it's always crowded. But it's crowded for a reason....

Hands down, best. Why did I give this only 3 stars then? Well, a restaurant's reputation doesn't live by food reputation alone. I also work in a restaurant on the side - so that kinda colors my vision as well.I read some really good things about Neptune Oyster and its food and was pretty excited to eat there. Being from San Francisco, I'm fairly spoiled for food quality when I go out. I really enjoy a good meal and I was excited to try some great seafood. So I walked in and saw it busy - an AWESOME sign of a good place. I saw people were busy, so I figured I'd give it a few. Good things come to those who wait, right? Then a Bostonian comes in and started asking me if I went to the back and talked to the waitress about getting on the list yet. Huh? You mean it's ok to barge into a restaurant and pile on more work to the already busy waitstaff? From what I learned, this is pretty standard as a practice in the area. I was a little horrified and I didn't see this as a service - I saw this as the restaurant not setting boundaries on their customers. Walking in to give a reservation to a busy waitress (most likely in the middle of another task) would be like going into the kitchen to ask where your food order is (and kitchens typically don't like that). Let people do their jobs. Anyway, the waitress came over to take my number, which was fine. It got weird when I asked if I could have a glass of wine while I waited. I mean, I'm a single diner and based on the area code, obviously from out of town and not sure where to go. All I got in response was that I couldn't have a drink and wait (only drinking while dining at the bar, which is fine) - but no suggestions as to where to go. Odd. I know from working where I do, if we had to tell someone to wait somewhere else, we'd give a suggestion at least.So I started walking around the block and then my phone rang with a number I didn't recognize. I figured it must have been the restaurant. My phone rang twice and that was it. I hurried back to wait some more (again, they were busy - I could appreciate that). When the waitress finally got to talk to me, my seat was given away. She claimed she called me a few times (entirely possible even though my phone said once) and put me back on the list. But then I got to thinking - what if I went somewhere for a drink and had to potty. Unless I'm very rude - who answers a phone while going potty? - that's kinda gross. Maybe if the people there left a message? Not sure why they don't.Anyway, moving on. After a few minutes I got a seat - mission accomplished. I then ordered some oysters, mussels (awesome) and a salad (awesome). After close to 30 minutes, there were still no oysters. WTH! Apparently they had a new shucker for the night. Again, it's fine if someone is new, but obviously, this person wasn't trained right or still needed to shadow someone to get more up to speed. I finally got the oysters, 30 minutes after ordering - but apparently there were people waiting longer than me!I guess my experience there was laden with management problems - which really colored my vision of the place being great and wanting to come back (good food alone is not enough). I don't blame any of the waitstaff or the oyster shucker. It's a busy place and people need to be enabled to do their jobs. Again, I also have my view because I work in a restaurant as well.My suggestions to management:--have a self-managed list for people to signup for a table. We do this all over the place in San Francisco - people signup and put a phone number or whatever. It takes the burden off of the staff to manage a list. People can write down a name and wait or walk. They get it.--have a voicemail left when a table is ready. Maybe tell someone you have 5-10 minutes to show or else your table is gone. What if the person is in the bathroom or indisposed somehow? To lose your table over that is just - well - kinda uncool.--don't allow customers to come in and interrupt waitstaff. People can wait - and make that clear. The interruption these new customers provide doesn't give anyone any better service. Except getting themselves on the list - see item 1.--If someone is new - help them to succeed and not throw them into the fire. They waited WAY too long to get the poor new guy help. I mean - it's obvious he's not ready. Maybe he needs more training during the day. Sure he did get help - but after being 30 minutes behind? Really?This place is really great foodwise....I just fear that over time, there will be somewhere new with equally good food and the business here will die off. I hope next time I visit Boston I can swing by with less aggravation and have a more relaxed time.

Scallops it was.The scallops came with duck confit, Brussel sprouts, blue cheese and D'anjou pear sauce. The quality of the scallops was good, but I felt distracted by the duck confit to really be able to enjoy them.

The 3 of us shared everything and by far, this was the best thing that we ordered!I'm afraid to order scallops anywhere else now, since my bar is now set so high.", "Date": "2012-08-26", "Author_Location": "Los Altos, CA"}, {"Author": "Milly H.", "ReviewID": "p3oFN5ySTX0oPRtpcKi_GQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is strictly for a special service that Neptune Oyster provided. \u00a0After drooling over the lobster roll for the last year, I insisted that my brother and his friend visit on a recent trip to Boston. \u00a0Being that it was his birthday, I wanted to pick up the check. \u00a0Neptune was able to accommodate this request for me without any issues, and my brother was so surprised when instead of the check, they gave him a note that lunch was on me. \u00a0It was so special, and I really appreciate them making it happen.", "Date": "2013-08-27", "Author_Location": "Raleigh, NC"}, {"Author": "Scott D.", "ReviewID": "35PROE-C_Sfjrj_2Te3auQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Anyone who knows Boston knows that that North End, Boston's Italian neighborhood, is notorious for it's narrow streets, lack of parking, and great restaurants. Neptune Oyster is one of those great restaurants.The restaurant is tiny with not much of a waiting area. When my wife and I got there, the place was packed. No room for us inside the door so we stood outside and waited.The restaurant is longer than it is wide with an L-shaped booth-like bench stretching along the entire left side of the space and half of the back wall. Several tables were jammed together in front of the bench with chairs on the other side. With seating for twenty-six at the tables and another ten at the bar, which ran along the right side of the restaurant, this place might be considered large by some North End standards. The very front of the restaurant, just inside the etched glass window fronting the sidewalk, was the raw bar where J and I watched the show. Rows and rows of shellfish, and a woman shucking oysters like she was pouring water into a glass. Smooth, effortless, perfect.After about ten minutes outside and another twenty minutes inside, we sat down at a table. J and I started our night off with two glasses of NV Borgo Magredo Prosecco and a dozen oysters. Four Wellfleet, medium sized, salty, and sweet; four kumomoto, small, sweet, plump, and creamy with hints of cucumber; and four Fanny Bay, medium sized, plump, low salt, sweet, and buttery with a melon finish. Neptune Oyster has a dozen different oysters to choose from as well as little necks, cherry stones, and shrimp cocktail braised in Harpoon beer.Moving on to course two, we shared Neptune's Bottarga Salad. Bottarga is cured fish roe and is delicious. This salad was fantastic with Boston lettuce, red grapes, fennel, caramel onions, white anchovy, grape seed oil and a Parmesan dressing.With dinner we drank a bottle of Carpe Diem Chardonnay from the Firepeak vineyard in Edna Valley, California. J ordered Neptune's Gloucester Cod Loin served with stewed tri peppers, oregano, mustard, freshly grated horseradish and a grapefruit vinaigrette. The plate was garnished with supremes of grapefruit.I ordered the Fillet of Salmon with a saute of crispy duck, pea tendrils, avocado, ginger and soy. Both of our entrees were truly spectacular, but J's cod loin dish may very well be the best dish of the year. The cod was cooked to perfection and the spicy horseradish was balanced so well by the sweet, tart grapefruit, the mustard and the oregano. The cod dish was definitely the star of the meal.Now for the best part of the evening. We return to the car to find a carefully placed PARKING TICKET on the windshield! Sometime between the last time I was in the North End and last Friday night, Hanover Street converted all the on-street parking to Residents Only after 8pm.Oh well. Neptune Oyster is awesome and worth a parking ticket.

If you ever want to come try this place, make sure to come 2-3 hours before the actual time you'd like to eat (esp. on the weekends), because that's how long of a wait it will be. If your stomach is on flex time, come on a weekday between lunch and dinner, and the wait will be a lot more manageable - 5-15 mins wait.Although there's a long wait, this place is definitely worth it. The lobster roll is amazing - get the hot one and ditch the cold - the hot buttery lobster roll brings out the fresh lobster flavor a lot better than the cold mayo ones (and that's a general rule of thumb with LR at any given place, trust me). $25 for a sandwich might sound a bit steep, but you get a butt load of lobster meat where you don't need to get cracking 3 lobsters to get to it. Aside from the lobster rolls, Neptune has a great variety of selection at the raw bar. It's like ordering sushi, they give you a little piece of paper with all kinds of raw goodness on it with descriptions for each of them, and you can order them by however many you want - great way to try different kinds and not have to commit to one option by the half-dozen like most other places are. (C'mon, we are all commitment phobic one way or another, it's difficult to commit to SIX of the same kind of oysters!)This place is tiny - bar seating on one side, tables on the other side against the wall. But to keep it as an oyster BAR, all of their seating are raised to a counter-top level (even if you're not siting at the bar). I really appreciate when restaurants put little details like that for their identity, so this makes me like this place even more.To compare with the other oyster bars in town, Union Oyster House is more touristy, for the history, and a bit more run down. Island Creek is more hip and modern, putting raw bar with a contemporary twist, where as Neptune is more of a classy, traditional and sophisticated oyster bar.

If you come here with several peeps, I also love the entire whole bronzini, which is cooked perfectly (but of course, with bones) and isn't for the lazy. Whole fish is always best. I recommend coming when you have less people, as it can be a grueling wait.

I don't think I've ever experienced such a level of oozingly outstanding decadence - I may just keel over into cardiac arrest any day now; nothings like butter and cholesterol to do you over...Neptune's is known for two things; their raw bar and their lobster roll... but it was our last day in Boston, so my BF and I went all out... oysters, shrimp, clam chowder, *johnycakes*, and their oh so coveted hot buttered lobster roll.They have a list of 10-15 different items on their raw menu. They were out of the one oyster I was eyeing, but we still managed to order a selection of different raw oysters and clams, as well as some giant sweet shrimp... It was fun knocking them back and getting a taste for northeastern oysters. They were all smaller than I imagined them to be, but.the champagne hinted one was definitely my favorite... When in Boston, get clam chowder... right?? The clam chowder here was stock full of fresh clams... but it was also very runny and less creamy and typical chowder-texture like than I prefer. Id prob not recommend the chowder from Neptune's - head to Quincy Market instead? Per recommendation of the people sitting next to us at the bar and our waitress, we got the **Buttermilk Johnycakes** aka honey butter, smoked trout tartare, and Little Pearl caviar on a cornmeal pancake. If I were to give a dish to describe decadent, it would be this one... it tasted as if a whole stick of butter was put into it, and it was divine! There was a hint of acidity to each bit of sweet and salty, and it had a great sense of textures... If I were given whatever I wanted in my last dying meal, this would definitely be on that list of my dying last bites. It really is THAT good, and I would definitely recommend it!The HOT buttered lobster roll... I'm typically not a huge fan of lobster; I prefer my crab and shrimp and raw seafood... but if lobster we're to be done any way, it should be done the way it is here at Neptune's: piled high and oozing with butter. Its over the top and definitely gonna require a few extra notches on your belt, but worth the go at least once if not more for the die-hard lobster fans.Overall an exceptional meal worth every penny.

This combo along with the freshness of the oysters made me curse like a sailor. Downed with some bubbly goodness I was in heaven. We also got 2 lobster rolls, one cold with mayo the other warm with butter.

Drenched and hungry, this place looked dry and cozy. Heading inside, it was empty. Apparently, we beat the rush by a good hour before it was flooded with people. Do get here early because it got packed even on a Wednesday night. We seated ourselves at the bar and our waiter was quick to greet us. Staring hungrily at the row of oysters by the window, the seafood fiend next to me could hardly wait. I was excited as well especially since I have never tried raw oysters before. As it turns out, I couldn't have picked a better place to do it.To start, you're given a piece of paper and a yellow pencil to write how many oysters, sea urchin, shrimps, clams, etc. you want. We decided to go all out with the raw bar getting a bit of everything plus the P.E.I mussels appetizer. What did it for the appetizer was the curry broth. Be sure to save a piece of the bread you get in the beginning to pair it with remainder of the broth.I love the jumbo sized shrimps! One bite, you'll get this overwhelming sensation that you're sitting out on a dock by the beach with the Caribbean breeze blowing through your hair. It's my way of saying this is damn refreshingly fresh! The cocktail sauce was delicious even by itself! The spicy mustard slabbed on top makes it all the better. The oysters were A-mazing! \u00a0I honestly couldn't tell which was which since everything was served on this gigantic silver platter with ice. Our waiter did tell us, but seriously I was just nodding \"okay, yup yup,\" hoping it'll help speed up his monologue so I can quickly feast. This whole experience rocked my taste bud. Some were salty while others were sweet. That oyster juice was so good that I wish they sold it in bottles at CVS or something. Titled \"Wellfleet oysters juice\" now flavored with cocktail mustard and garlic. The cherrystone and little neck clams were also deliciously succulent. I think the little neck clams were the most salty ones of the raw stuff I've tried. \u00a0Definitely come here for their fresh oysters selections. It's a pricey place but well worth the money.

Well, perhaps not the plague. Maybe I avoid the North End like the flu, as I do head there occasionally. But the point is that the hordes of tourists and the restaurants that get by serving their unknowing patrons lackluster, and often, inauthentic cuisine, prevent me from staying too long. It's no surprise that my favorite place in the North End, Neptune Oyster, is a seafood restaurant with an emphasis on shellfish.I have been meaning to try the lobster rolls at Neptune for, I kid you not, four years or so. \u00a0I needed to know if a roll in a sit down restaurant with a $25 price tag really did trump all of those served up at seaside shacks. So, I clearly took my dad here for Father's Day out of loving daughterly devotion and not at all out of the need to satisfy my own selfish shellfish affinity...The tiny spot, with its nautical tiling and window full of fresh oysters, clams, and shrimp, probably only seats forty, three-quarters of them with lobster roll in hand. For one who tries to avoid tourist traps, I may have come to the wrong place. In fact, while waiting to be seated, one family on the street told us they were from Maryland and had tried on two other trips to Boston to get in.But trap Neptune was not. The restaurant satisfies both CT-style lobster lovers and everyone else by offering its rolls hot with butter or cold with mayo. I told my father that there were rules to our outing: We were to each order a lobster roll. One had to be buttered, one had to be mayoed. We were to split these evenly. We were to eat the buttered one first so as to enjoy it while warm. Again, I stress the daughterly devotion. Rules and regulations, though, went out the window, because both of us had strong preferences. My dad only had eyes for the cold lobster roll, but I did steal a bite or two and was impressed. Both rolls featured only whole pieces of claw, knuckle, and tail meat which were substantial and weighty, yet not at all chewy. The brioche bun certainly tipped its hat to the traditional hot dog roll and its light sweetness heightened the extreme sweetness of the lobster. This was not, however, a refined experience. Whole pieces of lobster means a whole lotta mess. The soft bun perfectly encased the cold lobster but quickly split when topped with, no saturated by, the buttered lobster, which sent streams of fat down my arms. Although, \"streams of fat\" may not sound particularly appetizing, I definitely have to declare the lobster roll with butter the winning sandwich. The sweet butter gave the lobster such depth and richness while allowing what we paid $25 dollars for to shine. I would certainly also order the cold roll again. The coating of mayonnaise was so very light and added a sexy silkiness to the experience. It also gives you the option of forgoing the knife and fork if you simply want to hunker down and eat the lobster roll as it was meant to be eaten.As for the sides, the roll is served with a heaping pile of fries, which I expected to only be a forgettable requisite but which were instead well-seasoned and nicely browned. I opted for some mixed greens, which were woefully overdressed. I've heard great things about other menu offerings and the raw bar, which I would love to try, but as I said, there were rules to this trip.Just as you sometimes feel the need to get the burger from Radius, I guess there's a time and a place for a good $25 lobster roll.", "Date": "2011-10-03", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Monique N.", "ReviewID": "SWS5gooAPjG3BITQyNj_Qg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I heart Neptune Oyster!My hubby and I visited this place twice and each time we are amazed that the food is consistent and you cannot beat the authentic atmosphere, character in the decor everywhere you look. \u00a0Our first visit was during a quiet afternoon and our second, a hustlin' and bustlin' weekday evening. \u00a0On our last visit, we started off with a round of 8 pairs of select raw oysters, the freshness is amazing! \u00a0Accompanied with cold glasses of harpoon IPA.

We ended up sitting at the bar, which was fine.We had:Fried Oysters - They were great, perfectly fried, and the tartar sauce it came with was homemade and very tastyOysters - We had about a half dozen oysters.

Well, maybe except for the wait. I love seafood! It's kinda my thing.The goods: I ordered 3 different types East Coast Oysters and they were amazing. I wish I could tell you what they were, but I insisted on letting the waiter choose them for me. On a side note, if you don't know what's good just ask the waiter/waitress. The Oysters were shucked on the halfshell and placed on a bed of crushed ice served with condiments. Not bad for approx $2.50 a pop.Then there was the HOT or Buttered Lobster Roll. I can't even begin to tell you how awesome this thing is! It's a good amount of lobster chunks in the roll served with fries. The fries are also very good and are often overlooked because the lobster roll just eclipses it. The roll is $25 and is worth every penny. When the lobster roll hits your lips it just melts in your mouth. The lobster topped with warm butter very tender and the roll containing it all together is moist. It's pretty much a perfect combination. To top things off I had a Peroni to finish it off.The ONLY complaint:The wait was a little long. Give or take an hour or so just to get a table. Luckily for me I had a layover for 3 hours and got a seat at the bar right away.Overall:It's a quaint little place that has a knowledgeable waitstaff with passion for what they serve. From talking with some locals and outsiders like myself, I've found that this is probably the best hole in the wall place. People are friendly and the food is amazing.

Fresh, thick slices of beautiful yellowtail lightly topped with salad green garnishes and homemade kimchi (yes, kimchi) underneath with a little cucumber/lime/salt sauce to accompany. Delicous!I had the North End Cioppino for my entree and it was amazing. Basically a seafood stew (two of my favorite things in one) served with saffron rice.

I'm a huge fan of the lobster roll at Luke's Lobster in NYC, where the lobster meat is very flavorful with all the butter and seasoning they put on it. $25 for a hot lobster roll and fries here, vs. $17 at Luke's for a roll, chips, and a drink. \"This better be worth it,\" I said to myself.It was. It was worth the $25, worth the 1.5 hour wait for a seat, worth enduring sitting next to two obnoxious biznatches who thought we couldn't hear them and kept commenting on how we were such tourists for taking pics of our food.I want to estimate that Neptune's lobster roll had about twice as much meat as Luke's. The chunks were gigantic and juicy. The big difference was that Neptune's roll was much more \"au naturel\"; the hot bun was buttered, but the lobster meat itself tasted very pure and fresh. The fries were awesome, too. I can tell I'm going to have dreams of Neptune's lobster roll; one of these mornings, I'm going to wake up with drool all over my pillow.

Given all the reviews that mentioned a long wait, I made sure to get there just before 6pm to avoid the dinner rush and was immediately seated in one of two remaining tables.We started with a sampling of oysters from the raw bar, all of which were fresh and delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed the nutty finish of the Summersides so much that he ordered another two for himself. I ordered the blue crab cocktail, which was around $15-18 market price, expecting the usual not-too-little-but-not-generous Manhattan helping of lump crab with cocktail sauce on the side given the price. I was pleasantly surprised when the waiter delivered a heaping bowlful of crab meat, and was even more astounded by the flavor: amazingly fresh crab with a spicy kick of what I believe was horseradish. Just recalling the dish now, I'm salivating and lamenting the fact that I can't have it for lunch today.For the entree, my boyfriend decided to try the vitello tonnato sandwich. The combination of tuna tartare, veal, and spicy mustard was intriguing on paper, and the sandwich itself did not disappoint - a single bite was an explosion of flavor so surprising, very different but incredibly delicious. I had the lobster roll hot with butter, as recommended by many of the reviews here on Yelp, and it was as flavorful and fulfilling as I imagined it would be. If there's one thing Boston does right, it's lobster, as no matter where I went during my trip, the lobster was always juicy, fresh, and well-cooked, and Neptune's lobster roll was no exception. I also appreciated that they weren't stingy with the lobster, as that seems to be a trend with a lot of places that serve lobster rolls.Overall I was very moved by my dinner there, so much so that I'm writing a wordy out-of-town Yelp review, which I rarely do.

There's absolutely no room to stand inside the restaurant. It's a pretty tiny place and the \"waiting area\" really can't hold more than a couple people. The nice thing is, you go in, you put in your name, and your phone number and I guess some people just go until they're being called? I can't be sure they actually call you since we waited there. But I assume since they did ask for your number and and most people just kind of disappeared after they gave their names and numbers. We were seated after waiting for 30 minutes, which was not so bad I suppose. Tables are really close together so you can definitely hear what your neighbors are saying. Since we had cold lobster rolls at other places, we thought we'd try the hot lobster rolls. Boy, did we make the right choice. Very generous portion.. The Mr and I shared our order since he wanted to try the Lobster Bisque too. We both regretted not getting our own plates. Cousin who normally never finishes her plate gulped down the big roll herself... and the fries. I can't remember the exact price, but I believe it was around $25/plate. Not cheap, but the portion definitely matches the price. The Mr. really liked the lobster bisque too. I didn't try it, so I can't give my opinion here.

It really couldn't have come together any better. We started off the day knowing that we only had limited time in Boston before our flight, so we figured we'd eat an early dinner. We were determined to eat at a great seafood place. That morning, for no good reason, we declared the day to be the \"Day of Lobster\". It started off with a lobster omelet at the hotel and went from there. Neptune was to top it off.Not knowing anything about Boston and having no leads, we turned to Yelp, which in turn pointed us to Neptune. We did some touristy things to kill some time and then made our way to the restaurant around 3:30. When we got there we were surprised to find a line out the door already. Yikes. We put in our name and she said the wait would be around an hour and 45 minutes. Yikes again. But we were determined. We walked around what seemed to be Boston's Little Italy, had some food from Mike's Pastries (which also had a huge line), played in a children's playground... and realized that it only killed about an hour. We went back to see where we stood, and it didn't look great. We explained our flight situation and she told us to hang around and she'd absolutely have us seated within a half hour. Totally accommodating. Thirty minutes later, we got a call and we were sitting in Neptune. The place is really small, which is the reason why the waits are so outrageous. The entire left side of the place is a bar and the right side is about 7 tables. It seems a bit cramped, but you can deal with it because it's all very clean and pretty. Our waitress, Kristin, also doubled as the hostess. She was very busy, but our service never suffered. First we ordered some oysters because it seemed like it would be a crime not to, and of course we ordered the lobster cocktail to continue with the theme of the day. The lobster was good. I'm not big on oysters, but the two I had were alright. I liked being able to order different varieties and compare them all.For entr\u00e9es , we were all looking at lobster. Most of us were eying the lobster roll, however, and that seemed like a wasted opportunity since there were plenty of other interesting dishes on the menu. We told our waitress about our Day of Lobster idea and she suggested 3 lobster entr\u00e9es and an oyster appetizer for all of us to share. We ended up with a lobster salad, the grilled lobster, a lobster roll and the Neptunes on piggyback. She also helped us order a bottle of wine that goes well with lobster.Everything we had was delicious, but the lobster roll was everyone favorite. The flavors are very simple and traditional, but damn is it good. I could eat that roll soaked in butter and lobster juice alone everyday. I don't have grilled lobster all that often, so that was a nice change of pace and the salad was fresh and was a nice element. Overall, everything was great and it all came together nicely.

In hindsight, I am so glad I made that decision.Luckily, we had arrived at an opportune time and the wait was a little over 10 minutes. In the meantime, I was treated to watching the workers shuck oysters through the window. The interior of the restaurant is humble in size, but what they lack in square footage is made up for in qualify seafood.We ordered some oysters from the raw bar as starters while we waited for our lobster roll and yellowfin tuna. Unfortunately, razor clams were not being served that day, so we decided on a mix of west and east coast oysters. Flavorsome oysters with a taste like they had just been plucked from the ocean. Very briny with a hint of sweetness when biting in.Then the moment of truth arrived: My lobster roll arrived. I ordered it hot with butter and, to my extreme delight, they chef had drenched my lobster roll with it. It was just like a french dipped sandwich. I dove in and was overcome with flavors. The rich butter and the delicate lobster meat coming together on a roll meant to vessel this combination directly to my taste buds. I can now define my life to before and after having this lobster roll. If there it only one thing you could do while visiting Boston, this had better be it!Overall, it was an impressive experience. Come early or be prepared to wait if you come down during busy times. Also be prepared to pay a pretty penny when the bill comes.

They give you a oyster menu (think sushi menu at a Japanese joint), and you can write the number of each kind of oyster you would like. I loved the idea because I felt like the lobster roll would fill me up, but I still wanted to try the oysters since it is called Neptune Oysters.

Hostess said there was a 20 minute wait and that she would call me when a seat was available. Didn't have to wait 10 minutes before I got a call back, so that was a good start. I overheard that the wait was about an hour for a party of 4 at that point.Ordered three oysters of varying sizes, origins, and tastes to have some variety. They run about $2-3/oyster and all were nice and fresh. I definitely could've eaten a couple more but wanted to save my appetite. BTW, the triton plateau looked tremendous.Now the clam chowder. I LOVED. Probably my favorite part of the meal. I like my chowder not too heavy and this delivered. Fresh and flavorful with clams you can actually taste. I only wish the bowl were bigger.And then the Maine lobster roll. Nice, large chunks of lobster meat on a buttered roll with a large heap of fries. It was good but a little too buttery for my taste. Compared to a $15 lobster roll I have had from the Red Hook Lobster Pound, I felt that while you definitely get more bang for your buck the quality was just slightly higher. And the fries were sadly burnt. Maybe if they take that off the order it would be $5 cheaper and then you can leave your stomach room for more oysters...Service? Ehh.

Bored and watching TV, I suddenly had a craving for soup, more specifically, clam chowdaaaaah. I attempted to remember when the last time I had it was and that was at the end of October in Boston at Neptune's. So I started to reminisce about experience there...(insert dream ripples and harp music...)I walked into the restaurant, the place was small and crowded. Few gentlemen in suits in front of me and I was worried I wouldn't be able to get seated in time since I had about an hour to eat before I needed to get a cab back to Logan to fly back to California. Hostess approached me and said she had a bar seat available and a big smile formed on my face. I sat down at the bar and looked at the numerous selection of oysters in ice at the oyster bar. Looked over the menu, but really i already had in mind on what I wanted to order based on friends' recommendations.Summerside Oysters, New England style clam chowder, and the lobster roll with hot butter.Oysters came out first, freshly shucked right in front of me. (yelp.com/biz_photos/nept\u2026) I drizzled a little of lemon over all of them and slurped the first oyster in one quick gulp. Suddenly, Lionel Richie's Hello popped into my mind, why? \"Hello, is it me you're looking for?\" YES! YES IT IS! I've been looking for the perfect oyster and now that I've found you, I wanted to kiss/engulf you a thousand times! Golloped the next one with a dash of the red sauce and the sweetness of the sauce even brought out the sweetness of the oyster even more. A minute later, the whole dozen was gone and I didn't know what to do with myself, twitching already like a crack fiend in need of the next hit.Luckily, the chowder came out before I had to resort to prostituting my rotund body for more oyster money. (yelp.com/biz_photos/nept\u2026) The chowder was amazing. It was light and the freshness of the ingredients just bursted in your mouth. Just a dash of pepper and that was all I needed to compliment the chowder. Clams were plentiful and you just know that these clams were from cold waters.Finished that in about a minute and a half, would've been faster had I just thrown caution and my tongue to the wind to just down the hot chowder. The last order took a while to come out, I kept looking at my watch and started to worry that I might have to bypass cannolis from Maria's and just head back to Logan (#FatKidProblems). But then suddenly...(this next part was all in slow motion).A sweet aroma caught my nose and my heard turned. I saw my server come out of the back kitchen holding a plate on a tray. I squint my beady little eyes and tried to make out what was on this place. I could actually see the buttery smell arising off the place and making a streamline arrow towards my nose. She is taking forever to walk along the L shaped bar counter towards my end. Then she plates it down in front of me and all at once the sweetness of the toasted soft roll, the large fat chunks of perfectly cooked red lobster tail, and the dripping hot butter attacked my nose and a pool of saliva formed in my mouth. (yelp.com/biz_photos/nept\u2026) That picture does not do it one bit of justice nor will any of the meaningless words I have written or about to write. The roll was oh so toasty on the outside, perfect crunch at first, then followed by the soft sweet inside. Then I hit the barrier of rich, aromatic, hot butter and what glorious butter flavor it was. Finally the lobster meat: succulent, juicy, tender, hot, sickly, and ripe, it may my taste buds dance the Lambada, you know? The Forbidden Dance? Yes, the roll was in sync with my taste buds in a perfect harmony. It was beautiful and unfortunately ended too quickly.I looked down at the empty plate, tears building up in my eyes, and wanted to order more. However, my flight time was approaching and so I sent for the check. During the meantime, i devoured the delicious crunchy fries that came with my lobster roll. I thanked the server for delivering Heaven to me on a plate, bid adieu, and went off on my cannoli quest.Now I snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity. I'm in my cold house and yearning for Neptune's warm buttery lobster roll. Why do we have to be on opposite ends of the United States? Oh well, 'til next time our paths cross again.

I ordered the hot version of the roll which has lobster with hot butter as opposed to the alternative of cold margarine.

I recently took a trip to Boston and so many of my friends were recommending this place to me. I saw the $25 lobster roll on the menu and was like... shmeh. But people kept assuring me it was worth it, so I tried to grab a seat here... 3 times.First night was a Thursday. Following some advice on here, we figured we'd show up to put our name down on the list and settle for a late dinner (we're thinking maybe 9:30 or 10) since we were pretty full anyway. Decided to show up around 8:30 to put our name down and they were SOLD OUT for the night. I've never heard of a restaurant \"selling out\", but there ya go. It's ok, we have a few more nights so we'll just try again.The next night, Friday night, we show up a little earlier, this time around 7:15. Surely we'll get a table for late dinner. Nope! The hostess said we could maybe get a table around 10:30 or 11, but no guarantees. Wha?! Jesus, this place is popular!Finally, Saturday night, we do it right. Showed up at 5:30 to put our name down, we're told the wait will be around 1.5 hours and they'd give us a call. Perfect. We head back to our place, take a little nap, and get a call about 2 hours later saying our table is ready. We showed up and were seated promptly, and service was great.Now, onto the FOOD (I feel like half the battle was just getting a seat around here). I must say, it was worth all that hassle because the food was amazing. Oysters were amazingly fresh. Also got the johnnycake which was like... how do I explain this.... heaven in your mouth. No kidding. The cake itself was so fluffy and crispy and buttery, and the creaminess and saltiness of the caviar and trout tartare complemented it perfectly. And of course, we had to get the hot lobster roll. SO delicious. Lobster was perfectly cooked, plump and juicy with a little chew to it, on a perfectly buttered bun and crispy fries. It was amazing. I will have dreams about this lobster roll, it was so good. I wanted to order more, but we were pretty full after that. I bet anything here would be amazing though. And the bill wasn't too bad either.I'm only taking off a star because it is so hard to get a seat here. I understand that's just how it is, but if you're from out of town and aren't expecting that (since most restaurants aren't that way), it can be really frustrating (ran into several frustrated and angry out-of-towners hoping to get a seat here). At some point you either have to a) expand or b) change your system, but I guess it'll happen if it makes sense and is what's best for the restaurant. So overall, definitely worth the wait, but the wait issue should eventually be alleviated somehow.", "Date": "2012-04-23", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Eileen J.", "ReviewID": "Zg__H0KpGz4RPEwAIwKdxw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place is fantastic!

First, yes, the wait was as bad as people say. We had to wait 1 hour to get seated (as promised by the waitress), and this was on a random Tuesday. It's busy. It's small, and there's not a lot of seating inside. Memorial weekend must've been a nightmare.Bro Tip: you'll probably get seated faster with a party of 4 or less. Taxi cab size. We had a party of 5, and parties of 3 and under got seated before we did. They had to put 2 tables together for us. As visitors we had no problem waiting for \"the best\" so we strolled around the north end and admired the history, and quaintness of the entire area--as well as the filming locations for The Town. Not hard to waste time when you're entirely new to the area. Picked up some goods from Mike's Pastry a few blocks away. \u00a0There was only one waitress handling the floor (not counting the one behind the bar). She was polite and helpful, though clearly over worked, running around refilling water and taking orders. On to the food: We ordered the spicy seafood stew, 2 lobster rolls (hot), 3 different oysters, and 2 New England chowders. Seafood stew: A nice tangy spice along with some great seafood. A piece of whitefish(?), 2 pieces of salmon, and assorted shellfish. Not too bad. Oysters: we only ordered 3 because we came for the lobster and I never had any before. They have all the different types of shellfish listed on a sheet like a sushi bar along with descriptions of their flavor--like fine wine. I ordered one from Thatch Island with a \"buttery finish\". I couldn't really discern anything specific, but it was cold, refreshing, and surprisingly good. Not fishy at all. Lobster Roll: Comes prepared in 2 ways, cooked in butter, or cold with mayo. We ordered 2 hot ones because mayo would overpower the delicious lobster. It was worth the wait with it's buttery deliciousness on a toasted bun. Only thing negative was that I got some cartilage/shell in my sandwich that I had to pull out of my mouth. Not pleasant nor appetizing. -1 star.All in all, very good though expensive for the casual lunch.

The wait for seats is not the problem- there are plenty of places in the area to enjoy a drink or snack before your table is ready. They don't take reservations, but you can go early in the afternoon to put your name down. They call you when space opens up and you come back - you can't sit at the bar to enjoy a drink. Nothing was said about how long they would hold your seats for - so..then what is the difference with taking same-day reservations? Would they hold it for 10 minutes (like some places in NYC do) or until you decide to waltz in? And what is their policy if I missed the call? I missed the call but called them back and no one picked up. They finally picked up when my friend called them back a few times frantically since we have already waited over 3 hrs for this much anticipated meal. May I suggest working on your communication with customers or posting your restaurant policies somewhere? Food was ok. We picked an assortment of oysters, had the lobster roll and curry mussels.

We ordered the Triton platter, which came with raw oysters, cherrystone & littleneck clams, steamed (& very sweet!) mussels & tigerprawns, lobster salad & another salad (crab?) + a bottle of white. So delicious!!! Perfect after dinner meal :)The next time we came for lunch and amazingly, there was no one there. We were joined by 3 different groups afterwards though. The atmosphere was more laid back, you could see more of the place, all the details, like I noticed this really old (vintage?) black metal fan on the wall by the entrance to the kitchen, the nice tiles, etc. So the ambiance is really nice, both daytime & nighttime. Lunch was also amazing...tried 6 different types of oysters (the highlights were the kumamoto & I forgot the other type - Pleasant Bay?), clam chowder (very light on the cream, you can really taste the essence of the clams, this was so yum), and tried several appetizers, like hamachi ceviche, scallop spicy ceviche, octopus salad, & crab cakes (kind of Italian stye, it had basil, cheese, tomato...)

\u00a0WARNING \u00a0!!!!!If you do not get to the restaurant by 7:00 pm, you may not get seated - that's how busy this place is. \u00a0I am not joking, I watched them turn away more than a dozen dining parties because they were booked for the night. \u00a0They do not take reservations, either.Now that that's out of the way, let's talk food.I was in Boston this week for a convention and decided I wanted lobster. \u00a0Friends from home suggested I go to \"Legal Seafood\", but after asking some locals their opinion, the consensus was that Neptune Oyster was the place to go.So I checked Yelp and the reviews said I had to try the lobster roll. \u00a0Now that I had a plan, it was tune to set out and get my dinner. \u00a0Fortunately my hotel is only a 15 minute walk through a very nice section of town to the \"Little Italy\" area where Neptune is located.I arrived at 7:10 and put my name on the list. \u00a0I was told that there would be \"at least an hour wait, maybe longer\". \u00a0They took my name and cell number and said they would call me when my seat was available. \u00a0The restaurant is small, maybe 10 tables and the bar seats maybe another 15 people. \u00a0This explains why the wait is so long.While I waited, I walked around Little Italy. \u00a0What a nice, charming area! \u00a0I haven't been around a nice community like this in a long time. \u00a0Lots of other restaurants, bars, and shops to check out - I wish I was going to be here longer...Anyway, I was called at 8:15 and was told my seat was ready. \u00a0I sat down at the counter in the 1st seat by the door. \u00a0I had a great view of the oyster bar and the street, so dinner and a show!The waitress was quick to bring me some water and a menu, but I already knew what I was going to have....clam chowdah and a lobstah roll! \u00a0I placed my order and waited anxiously. \u00a0I didn't have to wait long and my chowdah arrived. \u00a0This was some very good clam chowder with BIG chunks of clam and potatos, and some very small diced celery bits. \u00a0This chowder was thin (think mikly, not the thick creamy stuff that comes out of a can). \u00a0The waitress even asked me if I wanted fresh ground pepper in it (yes, please!).As I was finishing my soup, the lobster roll arrived. \u00a0No before we get to the lobster roll, I need to talk about the fries that came with the dish. \u00a0Normally I'm very 'meh' on fries - they're always soggy, or greasy, or blah. \u00a0THESE WERE THE BEST FRIES I'VE HAD IN AGES!!! \u00a0Hot, crispy (but not greasy), and they had a nice TASTE to them - not that typical 'meh' taste that requires a ton of salt and/or ketchup.Now for the lobster roll, and we'll start with the 'roll' part. \u00a0Again, rolls to me are usually kinda stale, tasteless, and usually the worst part of a sandwich. \u00a0This roll is baked fresh at a local baker about 4 blocks away (I think that's where she said it was). \u00a0It was incredibly fresh, SOFT, buttery, and delicious! \u00a0It was about 7-8\" long, and STUFFED with lobster.I opted for the hot lobster and butter combo (versus the cold lobster with mayo). \u00a0The lobster is Maine lobster, and there are HUGE chunks of tail meat and claw meat in there. \u00a0This brings us a good point - this is a messy eat. \u00a0If you're wearing a suit or dress shirt - roll up the sleeves or you'll get lobster meat and butter all over them.All I can say is this was fastastic! \u00a0The lobster was fresh, the bread was fresh, and the fries were crispy! \u00a0If I ever make it back this way, I will probably try the Crab Coctail instead of the chowder, but I'm definately having the lobster roll again!Now go forth and have the best lobster roll you'll ever eat - you'll thank me later.Oh, and don't forget to go early!", "Date": "2012-06-06", "Author_Location": "Lake Mary, FL"}, {"Author": "Miguel R.", "ReviewID": "D8cxdTaPq_K8_-VShLWKjA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I passed this place twice trying to find it, and my my, what a terrible decision it was to try to be seated around 1PM on a Saturday.

I told the waiter and appreciated that they took the chowder off the bill.When the lobster roll arrived, I was excited but it was soooo rich that I found it to be difficult to eat.

I sparked up a convo with the house shucker and she told me their is almost never any down time and they are constantly busy. Another good sign. We started with some stuff from the raw bar (oysters, clams, and shrimp.) Everything was delicious, and very very fresh. We ordered 2 lobster rolls (1 cold-mayo, 1 warm-butter). Both were full of huge chunks of juicy, sweet lobster. We both agreed that we liked the buttered one best. However, this by no means discredits the mayo one. If (when) we come back, i'm almost sure we will order both and have the same eating/sharing arrangements.

It looked amazing so we got an order. HOLY COW were those mussels tasty!!!! Sadly, these came first because the rest of the meal was quite lackluster. The cioppino came out luke warm and tasted...standard. The lobster roll was good but drowned in butter, so much so that it tasted more like a butter roll - which is great but it gets old after a couple bites.

This place was amazing... I was in Boston area for business for a few days and had a few meals here and there but nothing really blew my mind or was worth noting. On my last day in MA I was in the area and decided to stop by! This place is nice and small... but the wait is insane! From what I heard from the servers, this place stops taking names for dinner on weekdays typically around 8:30 (they close at 9:30 on weekdays), and on weekends they told me its not unusual for them to stop taking names around 7-7:30 (they close at 10:30 on weekends!)!!!Who does that?! lol... so this already shows how amazing this place is.Luckily I came by myself and snatched a bar seat!From what I heard, MA is best known for the lobster (or lobster roll) and clam chowder. By that time, I had already had a lobster roll from another well rated restaurant known for their lobster roll (and I don't really like lobster all that much!)... so by the time I got to this place, I really wasn't feeling another lobster roll. However, upon the recommendation from everyone in the restaruant, I deicded to give it one more go....So starting off with the main entree, I got the lobster roll... and boy am I glad I got that!!! It definitely knocked my socks off and made me rethink liking lobster (as I'm more of a shrimp guy)! The lobster was hot and succulent. The meat tasted like they just picked out a lobster out of the sea, cooked it in a tub of butter, and got all the meat out... all in one go!! I don't think I've had lobster this good before and I was flabbergasted at how good it was! If I had more money and if they let me, I would've tried to take one to go (too bad they don't do to-go orders though because of how busy they are). The lobster was very buttery, hot as it came out to me, and cooked to perfection. You could taste a bit of the sea left in it as well!I'm not sure if they make their own rolls but would not be surprised if they do! Because their roll held up pretty nicely as well and was the perfect partner in crime for all those huge chunks of lobster!Also got their clam chowerder and had to try some of their oysters as well. Their clam chowder was a bit different from the west coast clam chowder it seemed... The chowder tasted a bit more... \"ocean-like\"? if that makes sense... probably doesn't but it was really good. I was impressed. Their oysters were probably a little less excited just because I've had some amazing oysters already. I got the island creek (from Duxbury, MA), and the Beausoleil (from Shippagan, NB) from the recommondation of my server. The island creek was better but was not super impressed in that arena (not to say it wasn't good like I said, but I've had amazing oysters already on west coast already). Once you sit down, service is great and food comes out reletively fast (if you aren't in a huge group or anything). So all in all, a fantastic last dinner at Boston MA. I am very glad I took the effort to drive down-town to get this meal. I can't imagine anyone getting a better lobster (or lobster roll) better than this place. The price and wait are def worth it. Therefore this place gets 5 stars in my book!

My group decided to try this place out for dinner. We were going to make reservations but then I saw on yelp that they don't take reservations. We ended up waiting about an hour for a table. Like many of the highly rated restaurants in Boston, this place was small but busy. Since this was close to our last meal in Boston, I decided to try the Clam Chowder, since we were in New England after all. It was pretty interesting. They had potatoes in it and it was creamy with an adequate amount of clams in it. I felt that the soup needed some more taste to it though. Instead of getting the soup, my friend ordered an enormous dish of mussels for an appetizer. I tried one and it was very good. I wish I had gotten that instead.For the main dish, I wanted to try the lobster since I heard they are plentiful and cheap in New England. However, the market price for it was like $50 so I went for the lobster roll instead. The lobster roll was covered in butter and looked tasty. I enjoyed it and it was very filling. However, I don't believe it's as good as my friend and the reviews here described it. I thought there was too much butter and it seemed to have overwhelmed the lobster taste. It also didn't look as good as some of the pictures I've seen of it.

Nothing worth having in life comes easily, unless you are a spoiled brat who is used to getting everything you want instantly. Small, local eateries are difficult to maintain in busy, expensive cities like Boston, and for this establishment to uphold a standard of quality for so long without compromising their culinary integrity is notable. So go early, plan ahead, and find something to occupy yourselves with, KNOWING that you will have to wait. Don't be one of those people who stands awkwardly gawking at others while they dine. That said, the food is excellent. The Lobster Roll is of course, as many have said before me, amazing. But rarely have I found a Northern Spot that accurately prepares a southern dish like Shrimp&Grits, and rivals Southern cooking! (I lived in the South for 15 years and my Man is from SC). Delicious, just the right amount of spice, and a whole lot of shrimp! Seriously. It's rare when eating a shrimp dish that when you get down to the last bites, you have shrimp left. Even with me sneaking them off his plate, he had a large last shrimpy bite!We tried 11 different types of oysters, and found the written descriptions to be accurate and enticing. We found we enjoyed them best with just a tiny squeeze of lemon, as they are ridiculously fresh, but to each his own. The mignonette is nice and the cocktail sauce had plenty of spice. However, despite the awesome food, the BEST part of our experience was the service. Although, as it was our first time at Neptune's, getting our name in with the very busy hostess (poor thing, what a tough job) at first was a bit confusing, we ended up with seats at the bar which was awesome, as our bartendress Julie turned out to really make our dinner more of an enjoyable meal. She has a great sense of humour, honest recommendations, and, as it was my birthday, sent out a few extra oysters on the house.. totally unexpected kindness but much appreciated and really sweet! I have worked in the service industry since I was 14, and this was an overall exceptional experience. If you want to be coddled, go find an overpriced place with white tablecloths where they crumb your table in between courses.

\u00a0Upon first entry, patrons will discover the uptempo vibe of this establishment to be both homey and relaxing. \u00a0The lively, upbeat atmosphere of the restaurant suggests a low key, good food establishment that's meant for patrons looking to converse at unabridged decibels. \u00a0Although the restaurant itself is petite in nature and somewhat cramped, the ultimate feel of the establishment is that you're here for the food and the conversation. \u00a0Don't expect high end white table cloth service at Neptune Oyster, here, it's all about the food.The Food...East Coast Oysters: \u00a0Buttery to the touch, clean to the taste! \u00a0The natural sweetness of the East Coast Oysters protruded during consumption. \u00a0Although hearty and slightly bitter notes were detected, the overall impression of the Oysters was derived from its complexity and sweetness. \u00a0A slight application of lemon juice provided the welcoming acidity, which helped to insinuate the Oyster's delicate texture and bold flavor.Cherrystone Clams: Scrumptious & Meaty are two terms that immediately come to mind. \u00a0At first taste, patrons will find that the delectable musky flavors from the Cherrystones are complemented well by the superbly clean finish. \u00a0Topped with cocktail sauce, the cherrystones provide a slightly bold bitter flavor that's enhanced by the mild tart / tanginess of the condiment. \u00a0Perhaps the most acclaimed remark that can be rendered to the Cherrystones is the textural contrast derived during consumption. \u00a0Boasting a buttery smooth outer texture, which alleviates to a meaty center, the Cherrystone clams provide an accompaniment of varied consistency.Cold Lobster Roll w/ Boston Lettuce Salad: \u00a0The visual appeal can be summed up with the 5,000 character constraints of this review. \u00a0Of course, I'll leave the visual aspect to the picture taken of this roll. \u00a0As for the taste, at initial consumption, patrons will find that the excessive (and somewhat insurmountable) portions of Lobster meat applied in the compilation to be both welcoming and humbling. \u00a0Each individual bite revealed a progressive quantity of scrumptious lobster meat. \u00a0As for the flavor, the perfect balance of mayo to crab meat provided both a slight tartness which helped with amplifying the natural sweetness of the lobster. \u00a0Furthermore, the perfectly cooked texture of the lobster meat helped with escalating the crustacean's natural delightful flavor. \u00a0Lastly, the substitution of French Fries with the Boston Lettuce Salad provided the welcoming flavor contrast of acidity, earthiness, and slight nuttiness to the application. \u00a0Overall, the Lobster Roll was superbly executed with no technical or presentation flaws present.Hot Lobster Roll w/ French Fries: Similar in presentation to the Cold Lobster Roll, two significant differences are noted... \u00a0The first being the roll was hot. \u00a0The second... \u00a0Mayo was substituted with warm unsalted butter. \u00a0Initial observations of the roll revealed that the heated application helped to elevate the natural sweet scrumptiousness of the Lobster. \u00a0The application of the unsalted butter in lieu of mayo helped with the magnification of the lobster's juicy consistency. \u00a0Further consumption of the warm lobster roll will provide both a mild detection of saltiness and peppery kick, which helps with enriching the delicate properties of the lobster. \u00a0The side of French Fries accompanying this application provided a welcoming crunchy textural contrast and mild starch profile to this dish.35 minutes later and the best meal ever consumed in Boston was complete. \u00a0Despite the wait time being 45 minutes to an hour, having a chance to sample Boston's Best Lobster roll was indeed worth the wait.Needless to say, this is the first restaurant I am hitting up when returning to Beantown!Notes on Neptune Oyster:- Wait times can vary from 30 to 90 minutes- Seating is cramped, suggest leaving large baggage behind- Although the lobster rolls were pricey ($25 each), it's best to get two and share both the Hot & Cold.- Get anything other than the Lobster Rolls and you're doing yourself a disservice", "Date": "2010-08-11", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Rick T.", "ReviewID": "pSFpzpsyWAHehAwXY6YrcA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered the \u00a0warm Lobster Roll with butter today and what a delight.!

Described simply as \"Maine Lobster Roll with toasted roll, hot with butter, fries\" and checking in at $25 all I can say is that the parts I was able to eat hot were everything you'd expect from hot buttered lobster - no more and no less. \u00a0Ample in portion and with the bread nearly saturated with butter while still holding its form I only wish more places in Boston served their lobster rolls in the manner as opposed to cold with Mayonnaise. \u00a0Was it worth $25? \u00a0Probably not, especially as I was not wowed by the fries - but it was quite tasty and prepared perfectly with a great meat to bun ratio and plenty of butter.With the check divided and paid our exit from Neptune would be almost precisely one hour after we entered the door and even then the wait time for those leaving their name at the door remained \"an hour to an hour and a half\" and all things being equal I'd say the experience and food was worth the wait at least once-but looking back in retrospect on my trip if I were a local I'd probably not return anytime soon unless I lived in the neighborhood given the quality, size, convenience, and reservations system of their new competition near Fenway - Island Creek Oyster Bar.", "Date": "2011-06-25", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Analisa S.", "ReviewID": "phjxxjYW-n-IcQZ1V_RCzw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The hostess is a snooty woman who gives herself a little too much importance.

I also shared the PEI Mussels with Angel and they were damned tasy-recommend getting hot bread to sop up the buttery sauce (although I still love Central Kitchens Mussels the best).

However during that 10 minutes another friend of mine shows up behind us and told me that he had been told close to 2 hours and that the hostess would call him, etc etc. He then told me how the hostess informed him that she tried to call him as well but yet no such call received.

To no surprise, the menu is dominated by fresh seafood, leave it to this nitwit to order one of two dishes on the menu that featured beef, it felt like I was ordering off the kids' menu. It's my fault for thinking this burger would be excellent, how could a burger be any good at a seafood restaurant? It's different, I'll give you that, maybe that's why it's so beloved, when do you ever see a burger with fried oysters? I feel that too often people like or dislike their meals before they even eat. Brioche, ground beef, garlic mayo, oysters and relish may sound appealing, but does it actually work well together? In my opinion, it does not, too much burger and way too much bun overwhelm everything else in this burger, despite being pretty well seasoned.Let's start with the beef, as any good burger blogger should do. It's above average in quality, probably nothing more than Chuck but I could be mistaken, and seasoned nicely. But it's over-cooked most of the way, medium about 75% of the burger, then oddly a perfect medium-rare for my last few bites. Either way it's more or less dry and not juicy like a burger should be. I was excited for fried oysters, but whatever attempt that was made at breading these guys was a failure, with only a couple of scattered bread crumbs managing to cling to the oysters, not like a fully breaded offering I was expecting. And there were only three sad little oysters, really not serving much of a purpose other than the addition of the fresh smell of the ocean, which I don't think I need with my burger, but that's just me. The relish offers a nice tang, but it can't stand up to the size of this burger, which is much too big both in the meat category and in the bread category. My old nemesis brioche comes up again, and fails again, and we've seen this too many times before; it's too much bread and it almost never works on a burger, no matter how pretty it looks.The French Fries are perfect, however, arriving crispy, fried to perfection, and salty in that glorious way that only a French Fry can be. I do believe that the burger could be improved upon by being a bit smaller, I'm not saying every burger has to be thin and griddled just to feed my preference, there's a place in my burger heart for a thick and juicy burger unequivocally, but too often larger burgers initiate more problems. It's not always easy to cook the proper temperature throughout, ingredients get lost along the way (garlic mayo was supposed to be on the burger, could have fooled me) and it can never be harmonious because you end up alternating between a bite of bread, a bite of meat, and the occasional taste of a condiment, but rarely do the ingredients come together at the same time.", "Date": "2011-01-28", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Irene L.", "ReviewID": "3HC6qcx_VaieC5HAl6iq_A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think this is over rated, compare the price and the food, the one in long beach called john's raw bar (as I remember) which I reviewed is a lot better than this one, and need to wait for an hour for a table.

And who to blame for this terrible spell? Neptune Oyster Bar. If you call yourself an oyster bar then you should know a thing or two about that briny little shellfish. My friends and I ordered about 20 oysters of local origin to down on Friday night, followed by some lobster rolls. We enjoyed ourselves heartily with the oysters (but, wait!) and even though the lobster roll was expensive and not that special (overcooked, poor quality butter) we left with smiles on our faces (even after waiting 1.5 hours for seats at the bar). Fast forward one hour and I am puking my ever-loving guts out at home and crying for mercy, a process that would repeat itself through the whole night and following day. This was coupled with a nasty fever and other, unmentionable, gross things. The culprit had to have been a bad oyster that in my hungry haste after the long wait I failed to detect.Now, it might seem unfair to write a one star review over one bad oyster. But, again, this is supposed to be an oyster bar. THEY SHOULD KNOW! We didn't go there and spend almost $200 so that one of us might get the lucky oyster that makes you never want to eat seafood again. In a lesser, not renowned establishment, maybe...but C'MON!

The atmosphere is busy but there is still an intimate feel and its not so loud you cant hear whomever you are talking to. I went with the same person both times I've visited Neptune Oyster and both times, we both LOVED everything we had. Whats funny is that on our first trip back in December, we loved what we had so much that we ordered the exact same meal on our second trip together this past week. We started with a selection of oysters including some wellfleets and kumamotos. The mignonette served on the side add's such a refreshing bite that really compliments the sweet and briny nature of the oyster. For our entree's, I ordered the tuna ribbons salad, similar to a nicoise. This salad is so incredibly fresh and delicious I cant even begin to explain. If you like fresh raw tuna, this salad is where its at. The aioli style dressing included on the dish adds such a depth to all the ingredients, tying the eggs, greens, haricot vert, , capers and tuna together perfectly. He ordered the vitello tonnato, a sandwich of epic proportion. Holy sandwich. The bread is a texas toast style, toasted perfectly and stuffed with the most luscious tuna tartare and layered with roasted veal. Its then topped with a crunchy cucumber salad and mustard sauce to boot. The play on the classic italian dish, traditionally served as a veal cutlet topped with a tuna sauce, is phenominal to say the least. If my friend wasn't going to order the sandwich this time, you better believe that I would have gladly done so. The contrast in flavors and textures is enough to make my mouth water but the execution of this sandwich is flawless. I highly recommend trying it. The fries served on the side are killer as well.Other notables to try, which I have been told are simply fab, include the hot lobster roll and the grilled bronzini.

We were seated promptly but with a bit of attitude from the waitress (there's not really a host here). An annoying thing about this restaurant is how cramped it is; even though you can get your own table for 2, it's pushed against another table for 2, so basically your party of 2 will be a party of 4, except you just won't know the other two people there. We didn't particularly like the mother and daughter sitting next to us with their snooty air and got especially ticked when they ate about 3 freaking clams from their entire appetizer and left the rest to be tossed. So wasteful... We had those clams in the wine and garlic broth as a starter, and wow were those good. Nice, garlicky, with a bit of sand in the clams but not too much to notice it terribly. I loved the broth; wish we had more bread (we got only got 2 tiny pieces of bread, AFTER asking our waitress, and then we asked for another helping) to sop up that clammy goodness. We also had the oysters, of course.. I can't remember all of them, but I do remember that we had the kumamoto and the pemasquid. This was my first time having raw oysters, and while they were very fresh and tasted interesting (sorry, this lack of detail is due to my lack of oyster experience), I'm not sure I'd want to get them again. We then shared the cioppino and the lobster roll. The cioppino had too much heat in it; yes, on the menu it says it's spicy, but I really don't think the average person can take that much heat. I can tolerate slightly more than the average person and so can my boyfriend, but we both agreed that if they had to make it spicy to give options to diners if they wanted it mild, medium, or very spicy. Kind of ridiculous. But the lobster roll was DELICIOUS -- we had it hot with butter in a roll (how else can you have a lobster roll?), and there was a very generous amount of lobster. All the seafood we had that night was fresh. The service, though, is something I was really upset about. From the moment we walked in we could tell the waitress had an attitude problem. She gave us a dirty look while we were getting seated, and in addition to that, she explained the sides and specials to the table next to us but didn't let us know that we had those options as well. And then, she also didn't give us the full wine list, but she DID do that for everyone else around us. I didn't even realize it until I noticed that all the other tables around us had one more menu than we had, and this was after we already ordered our drinks. We wondered if this may have happened since we were the only non-Whites in this restaurant... well, we could never really prove it. Our main courses also took a very long time to come; we probably spent over an hour waiting for them to come, which is really unacceptable. This isn't some large restaurant where several hundred people are being served. We asked the waitress if our dishes were coming, and she had this agitated look on her face and insisted they were coming. They didn't come for another 20 minutes after she said that. While the food was great and the seafood fresh, I'm still hesitant about coming here again because of the poor service and the long wait for the main courses.

I love it. I have only been here twice, both times for an early dinner on a saturday afternoon.First off, as it is the first thing that strikes you walking in, the place is tiny. If you have never been there, and you are reading this review and thinking about how tiny it might be, i will guarantee you that it is tinier than that. There are only a few tables and they are very close together. There is also a bar that sits maybe 15 people? Anyway, despite the cramped space, it still has a look to it. White and black tile and a nice bar. There is something very nice about it. Get there early. Because of the small space, it doesn't take much to fill the place up. Prepare to wait no matter what time you get there; you might get a table or a bar seat right away if it's off peak hours, but even then there's no guarantee because if one or 2 larger groups get there first you could be out of luck for a while. I recently waited about 20 minutes for bar seats at 4pm on a saturday. By 5pm, people were being told an hour.The food is just excellent. The oysters are the draw, they carry about a dozen options at a time with a pretty wide variety of flavor profiles plus cherrystones and littlenecks; everything i've had from the raw bar has been excellent. I've tried a bunch of the entrees there including the cioppino, a seared red snapper, a tuna entree, scallops and some steamed littleneck clams. The steamers were fine, they were like pretty much any decent steamers i've had, but that is the only thing i've tried there that wasn't exceptional. The snapper was the most perfectly cooked piece of fish i have ever had. The scallops were huge and flavorful and perfectly seared, served with (among other things) some of the nicest bleu cheese i've ever tasted. I have never tried their famed lobster rolls (they do look great but when i go there i'm not in a sandwich mood.)I have ordered white wine both times and been happy with what i was given but i'm not a wine person so i can't really review the wine beyond that it was refreshing and complemented my food well. The beer list is small but has some nice local brews on it. My sister swears by their belinis, offered in a bunch of flavors and made with fresh fruit juice.Service is friendly and knowledgeable. I have only eaten at the bar so i can't comment onthe table service, but the bartenders are great. They don't rush you out despite the small number seats; food can take a while getting out but in the meantime you can eat some oysters, have a drink and feel pampered.Prices are medium/high. Nothing is incredibly expensive on its own, entrees seem to be in the $20-$40 range, but it is easy to spend a lot of money there because once you start eating those oysters it is very tough to stop yourself from ordering more. 2 entrees, 10 oysters and 2 glasses of wine came to around $95 plus tip.", "Date": "2009-09-29", "Author_Location": "Cambridge, MA"}, {"Author": "Katrina W.", "ReviewID": "cOJIJEYlCe9SOOuwZQGpwg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Big Ups to my fellow Yelpers with all the reviews to Neptune.

Definitely the best place of our Boston/MV food tour.Atmosphere:It's a tiny place with a long bar that almost spans the complete room. There are maybe 30 seats available, which you cannot reserve. so take some time to wait (the waiter will take your number and you can go and have a drink at one of the many bars in walking distance until you get a table). Oysters are presented at the front window, the decor overall is comfortable and fits the seafood menu.Food:The PEI mussels were soft, no sand, great mussel taste with a surprisingly well tasting sauce. Not your average garlic white wine sauce, it is spiced up to taste a notch sweeter and very extraordinary - but still supporting the taste of the mussels rather than distracting from it. We had about 30 oysters and tried all oysters they sold that day. All were excellent in quality (which was certainly supported by the right time of the year for oysters), we specifically liked the Summerside ones.The Neptunes on Piggyback were fantastic, as well. I always try things in restaurants that I would never put together in one dish myself. Most of the time I find out there is a good reason why I wouldn't and occasionally I have a chance to extend my horizon. The fried oysters and the pig already worked incredibly well together and came on a very tasty bread. The raisins were a fabulous addition to that taste, I simply loved it. I considered ordering it again as a main dish...But then decided for North End Cioppino, which was a delicious fish stew with saffron rice. Very tasty and the prawns topping the dish were as fresh and moist as they get. Yummy. Some of the fish was a bit dry, but that's to be expected as they provide the flavor for the stew.We also had pan roasted fish from the daily menu, which came roasted to perfection, extremely moist and very lecker. And least but not last at all Lobster Stroganoff. Wow, that sounds crazy and it tasted very, very well. Not too much cream so that the Lobster taste was strong in the dish. Surprisingly (again!) the Lobster was supported by the mushrooms, rather than put to the background. Just great.Drinks:The wine selection was really good. We picked a very nice French Sancerre, but I don't remember which one it was. It did go very nice will all our dishes.Service:Though no reservations are accepted, you get a call when your table is ready (after you showed up with the complete group).

It needs to be a little bigger. They sat us at the bar and that would have been okay if the stools had backs, but they don't and my friend and I both did not like that. They also had tables, but it was tight in there and there was a line out the door so we waited and that was the first available. We were curious. It was really good. We had some calamari that was sauteed in some kind of tomato type juice/sauce it was not thick enough to be sauce, but not watery enough to be juice if that makes sense. I had never had calamari done this way. I've only had fried calamari with an array of sauces but this one topped them all. \u00a0There were olives cut up and some kind of green in the sauce as well. It was very tasty.For my main course I had the Georges Bank Scallops with Duck Confit and Pear Anjou and brussel sprouts. It was awesome. I suck at cooking scallops at home. Some things I leave to the professionals. Scallops is one of them. Excellent job! My friend had the lobster roll with butter. I have to be honest. I love lobsters and specifically lobster rolls but the only time I've ever seen them with butter instead of mayonnaise, was at the Big E in Springfield, MA and it was so gross and like dried out, but I should have relalized that I was at Neptune Oyster and it wasn't going to get much fresher and better than that. I checked out my friend's, she offered a bite, but I've been losing weight, so I was trying to stay away from all that butter. Plus every time I have had a brioche roll, its been dry and not the way I am used to having a lobster roll like at Kelly's Roast Beef where they butter and toast the roll. But this one looked really good. She said it was. The prices were right in line with what I envisioned being they are high end, in the north end and near the ocean so everything is so fresh. The service was good. the waitress/bartender was very attentive, but we did wait quite a while in between the appetizer and main course. We ended up saying something. They handled it well. At first seemed annoyed but quickly got over it. It is way too cramped in there. I'll go there again, but I hope they expand some day. You need room to move when you're eating.

We went with the Sangiovese, which was quite yummy and seemed like a good choice being in the North End and all. Then it was magic time, the oysters came out with a cocktail sauce and a nice mignonette. The oysters were so fresh and had a nice straight from the ocean flavor to them. The only thing that could have made those little raw critters seem more fresh if I was sitting on the beach. Then came the mussels, which were cooked in a red curry broth with cilantro, garlic and cashews. I don't know about you but I feel that mussels and curry is a great duo, such a great combo. They even brought out some bread for us at the end so we could sop up all that delicious broth at the end.The food was great, so fresh and delicious. The wait staff was great, playful and fun.

As with majority of people, the warm lobster roll had been my favorite dish only because it is not easy to find warm lobster rolls. All other dishes there have been good with the exception of the Clam Chowder which is lackluster. Even with the popularity of the place, I still enjoyed the lobster roll until yesterday. A little background: last week I was in CT and ended up at a restaurant that yes, had warm lobster rolls. I really enjoyed it but wished they used the same bread as Neptune Oyster. Since I had that in mind, I decided to stop by Neptune yesterday around lunch and shockingly, was able to be seated almost immediately (since I was solo, I guess). Of course, I got the lobster roll and was rather surprised to see that there had been some changes since my last visit there mid-August. The meal portion was considerably smaller, even the fries. I did not complain though since the prior portions were considerably large and this one was somewhat manageable but, it is about perception. The bread not as sweet as it used to be, there was barely any butter on mine, and the lobster was overcooked. Now, if that was my first time there I probably would have raved about the lobster roll but sadly, for me it demonstrated a negative turn and all I can think of is that other warm lobster roll in CT. \u00a0As I looked around, it was easier to count the people that did NOT have the lobster roll which I think explains the significant drop in standards.

They took our number down so we could roam around while we waited.

Strangely, we sat there for over 5 minutes with no one taking our order. I got grumpy - hey, if you're going to have customers waiting 2hours, expect that they're going to look for very good service. When the waitress finally came by - my icey attitude melted away because she was very nice. We ordered a bunch of oysters for an appetizer and 2 hot lobster rolls for dinner. I had trouble deciding on a glass of wine and asked for a suggestion by the waitress. Well, I guess I should have realized that I may have set myself up, but little did I know she suggested the $15 glass of red. I had no idea it'd be $15...there were no other red wines by the glass on the menu for that much. It was delicious - so her suggestion wasn't bad - but I got sticker shock when the bill came. 2 glasses costing a cool $30 - add on 2 $25 lobster rolls, oysters, and my husbands beers - it was a legit bill.

They give you a slip of paper w the flavor profile of each oyster, you write down how many of each kind you like. Love it!I get the Johnnycake, I feel it is one of the most wonderful things in the world. I wanna spread the smoked trout, caviar and creme fraiche all over the cake, roll it up and eat it, but I dont, I use a fork. The cake is crispy, a little sweet and a little savory and the perfect accompaniment to the fish. It is in my eyes, absolutely perfectly constructed, thought out, and executed. It humbles me with its simplicity, texture and flavor. These people in the kitchen care about me as a customer so much that they create dishes like these. It makes me feel loved to be in there. For another starter, I've also had the neptunes on piggyback, they're fried oysters on roasted pork on crostini with pistachio aioli. I have to try this dish again, to be honest I had it right after I had the Johnnycake for the first time and I was still weak in the knees from the johnnycake, its hard to follow that johnnycake.I've also had their burger, it is a beautiful thing. Why waste stomach space on a burger at a seafood place? Because it has fried oysters on it, and if they care about their meat as much as their seafood, its a lock that the burger would be divine, also the lovely Sarah (hope I spelled it right) recommended it. It was, in fact, divine, perfectly cooked (although a little under seasoned for my taste) with cheddar, fried oysters, garlic mayo and a pickle relish. A Beautiful Burger! Beautiful is how i would describe everything I've had here, not so much in presentation, but in flavor.

It's actually quite a bit cheaper than I would expect, given the quality. I had the buttermilk johnnycake as an appetizer -- something I'd never even heard of before. It's a honey butter cr\u00eape topped with smoked trout tartar and caviar. Now, I'm an American/Italian food kinda gal -- cheeseburgers, calamari, potato skins, et cetera -- but this completely blew my mind. I ate more slowly than I ever have in my life, just so that it would last longer! For dinner, I had the Maine lobster roll, served hot. This being March and, thus, not lobster season, I didn't expect to be impressed... but it was by far the most delicious, juicy, succulent lobster I've ever had. And they didn't drench it in butter, either: it was lightly brushed -- the perfect amount. Absolutely amazing! Months later, I still think about this dinner and wish I didn't live 3,100 miles away so I could visit it more than once a year!The service was attentive and friendly. Our drinks were never empty, and the food came out speedily and with care. The chef himself attended our table on no fewer than three occasions to make sure we were happy and to offer any assistance he could -- even such mundane tasks as filling our drinks.Those who are looking for a quiet, spacious, private place for a relaxed dinner or an intimate date will need to look somewhere else. It was noisy (though not prohibitively so -- I never once had trouble hearing my companion) and incredibly crowded, even when sitting down. We shared our table with two other couples (there are only spots for perhaps 30 people in the entire restaurant). That said, the air of happiness, the smell of delicious food, the hustle and bustle of a busy, successful restaurant, the chatter of obviously pleased customers, and the warmth of both the staff and the interior itself contributed to making the experience an exceedingly comfortable and enjoyable one.The bad: the wait is long -- hours, and even so it's still far longer than they quote -- and annoying in that there's no standing room. I was incredibly frustrated by the time our table became available; we'd been shoved, pushed, and snapped at by other equally frustrated customers for far too long a time.

Oh how I love Neptune Oysters. Let me count the ways: 1) The menu is perfect and focuses on fresh seafood with an emphasis on tasty oysters. I've had east coast oysters like Malpeques and Blue Points to the west coast varieties like Kumamoto and Fanny Bay. It's all good. 2) Hot lobster roll with butter on a toasted roll. Hot diggity damn do I love this and I'm from Maine! I grew up a lobster roll traditionalist -- lobster, a bit of mayo, and a toasted hot dog bun is what I had considered to be the bomb, but the hot lobster roll at Neptune Oyster is awesome. And for those times when I am feeling a bit traditional they do offer a cold lobster roll with mayo (not as good in my opinion though). 3) Olive oil shallot mignonette for your oysters --hey you are in the North End after all so this mignonette really represents your location. I thought it was weird the first time I tried it, but now I kind of like it. It adds a nice flavor with my oysters. 4) Try their daily specials -- lobster spaghettini, fritto misto, risotto...c'mon this ain't some leftover crap you'd get at most restaurants. Their specials are GOOD and again fresh. They often sell out!! 5) Wine list -- by the glass, by the half bottle, or by the bottle. From fairly inexpensive to much to much for my budget they have a great selection and the staff don't bat an eye if you order the $29 bottle of white or the $100 of red. 6) The staff are really quite unpretentious here which is a rarity. They are friendly and move quickly and are unassuming and make suggestions are the right time. I could keep going, but here is what I recommend you do:Walk to the T. Get on said T and head to Government Center or Haymarket (your choice). Walk from T to the North End, Salem Street to be exact. Go into Neptune Oyster. Order a dozen (to start) of east and west coast oysters. Order a glass of wine or even a bellini. Order a hot lobster roll.

First lets start off with the Fried Clams...Ive been everywhere for fried clams and they're prob my favorite thing to eat...Woodmans, Farnhams, Clam Box, Clam Shack, Kellys...you name it Ive been there. The Clam Shack in Kennebunk,ME was the mecca of fried clams for me until I had them at Neptune. They were done perfectly...nice slightly salty taste and a perfect batter. The Oysters made Legal Seafoods raw oyster bar seem like a joke...so fresh you could taste the sea water. Finally the lobster roll...a Real Lobster roll...chunks of lobster meat tossed with butter and the most amazing french fries makes me wish I never moved to LA if I knew how good this spot was. Special Thanks to Tiffany our waitress who gave 3 glasses of champagne on the house for my birthday. I give this place THE BEST OF THE BEST AWARD....100/100 I certainly DUKE IT!!!I do want to note...the lines are insane here...Heres my advice...GET THERE EARLY...Anytime after 5:30 you are looking at a 2-3 Hour wait due to limited seating...

My only complaint is that the roll didn't necessarily seem up to the task of holding on to that much buttery lobster. Other than that though, amazing. My cioppino was very good as well and contained quite a bit of seafood. It looks kinda small at first, but in the end it turns out to definitely be enough food. The service was fine for such a fast paced place. I can't say that it was stellar by any means, but it was more than acceptable for a place of this size with epic wait times. Overall, the food was 5 stars and the service was good enough to not drag it down...so that is 5 yelp stars in my book.", "Date": "2013-07-01", "Author_Location": "Claremont, CA"}, {"Author": "Megan C.", "ReviewID": "1dCL4atV4_5lvocSUdCtXw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is THE PLACE to get a warm, buttery LOBSTER ROLL.

I don't like to double up, but this place is sooooo good that I couldn't stop myself.Went here first to celebrate a friend's new job and so, of course, we started with some prosecco while we perused the menu up at the bar. After some careful deliberation we got a bangin' bottle of wine, at a reasonable price, and the Triton Plateau to start. I say to start, because we were set on getting that famous hot lobster roll, but when the $48 cold bar platter arrived, it was pretty clear there'd be no lobster roll. 6 oysters, crab legs, cherry stones, little necks, mussels, and two giant bowls containing a lobster and a crab \"cocktail.\" Everything was amazing, but I was a huge fan of the crab cocktail. Basically some fresh bluepoint crab tossed lightly in a dressing of herbs and a little mustard... it was amazing. And I was surprised at the lobster cocktail being so fresh and amazing. I'm used to pre-shucked lobster being kind of pasty or rubbery, and this was neither. Too full to continue on, the amazing bartenders brought over some after dinner wine to say, \"hey, thanks. You guys are awesome.\" And we said, \"yum,\" and tipped them like crazy.Second time around we dove in with a bottle of white that the bartender helped us select, and after three tastes we found one that we liked. The bartender was totally helpful and nice, and not at all annoyed at the girls who didn't like a couple of the wines. We started with the GIANT shrimp cocktail (this shrimp is borderline lobster, they are so big). Amazing and horseradish-y, they were the perfect started for the hot lobster roll. Finally. And it lived up to expectations. A roll piled with warm lobster, tossed in butter, and paired with some awesome house-cut french fries. The roll was soaked in butter, in a delicious way. Basically, when I dream, it is about this lobster roll.I hate giving so many high ratings, but this is the best seafood restaurant I may have ever been to.

The first time i went to Boston, my friend and I couldn't get on name on the list, it was only about 7-8 pm. We were very disappointed since we were only there for the night. I definitely had to come back JUST to try this place. So recently, I came back, mainly to finish up eating at all the places I didn't get to on my first trip. The wait is long, about 1-2 hours on weekends for dinner to get seated, but the good thing is they take down your name and number and call you when a table is ready so you have plenty of time to walk around north end. It's a fairly small place, right in between fine dinning and local's go to. The service is great, attentive waiters and helpful suggestions. They'll keep an eye on when you're done and are on top of getting your next order in, and trust me, you will order multiple rounds. I was only looking forward to the oysters, but it probably wouldn't filling, so I asked for suggestions on appetizers. We chose yellowfin tuna tartare.. it was heavenly, melt in your mouth texture with out of this world dressing mixed into it, on top on toasted rye. It was the best tuna I've had, I devoured every last bit of it. Shrimp cocktail were next, and you can't mess those up, but they always have their way of topping everything! THE BIGGEST SHRIMP I'VE EVER SEEN. So juicy and sweet, I didn't even need the cocktail sauce, it was perfect alone. Then of course, we were given a list of west and east coast selection of the oysters, I wanted all of them. And that's exactly what I got. We made our round and tried every single selection available for the season (during november). Freshest oysters I've ever eaten, hands down. You'll taste the distinct flavor of each one from the area that they're from. Some more ocean-y than others, but I'm sure there's one to fit any person's palate. From nutty, to fruity, to champagne-like flavors; you'll find it all in these succulent oysters. My boyfriend and I had many favorites, so of course we ordered a second round. Ones that stuck out to me most were Kumatos, from WA (these little ones hold a lot flavor, don't be deceived), Summerside, Wellfleet, Island Creek from MA, and Beach Blonde from RI.

I forget which ones they were but in their description I remember they said \"with a melon flavor\" or something like that.

Buttery, toasted bun just bursting with huge chunks of delicious lobster.

Monday wait was still about 45 minutes. Not a big deal, the Modern Bakery is right around the corner for cannoli goodness. \u00a045 minutes later, a harried waitress seated us at the worst seat in the restaurant -- at the tail end of the bar, next to the bathroom and the chlorine-spewing dishwasher. That's fine, we can deal. \u00a0Then we waited for the bartender, who was apparently the manager on staff to wait on us. 20 minutes later, after several attemped mild-mannered flagdowns, we finally had our drink and raw-bar order taken. In that time, the chatty couple next to us were finally served (after 40 minutes, they said). Then half-way through their dinner, their much-awaited appetizer arrived. When they complained, saying not only was the dish far too late, but that they tried to flag down the bartender twice to cancel the order... the bartender argued with them for several minutes that they should still take it. \u00a040 minutes later, we received our oysters -- easily the highlight of the evening. They were exactly as described on the order card -- tasting like the distilled essence of the ocean. When the bartender dropped them off, we joked with him that it looked like the kitchen must have been short staffed, expecting a slower Monday. He gruffly said 'No, this is a normal Monday, and we have the same staff as normal.' \u00a025 minutes later came the clam chowder. It wasn't terrible -- was even pretty good, if under salted, potatoes under-cooked and almost crunchy. At least it was real New England style, with a creamy, but non-flour-pasty thick broth.  \u00a010 minutes later (and an hour and a half after we sat down), I finally received my much-awaited lobster roll. Toasted roll... butter... hot lobster. \u00a0...What a let-down. \u00a0The lobster was OK. Far less sweet than a northern Maine crustacean, and a bit on the tough side. There was plenty of it, and it was drenched in butter over a toasted bun. But... The bun was a non-descript semi-sweet roll. And the butter was unsalted, and the lobster meat cooked without salt or ocean water. So the whole of it was more of an oily-slobbery pile of rubbery lobster... However, when I was finally able to flag down the bartender after another 5 minutes for salt, I was able to eat the rest of the roll with at least a modicum of flavour. \u00a0On the other hand, the fries were far over-salted, and a quarter of them over-cooked unto charred. \u00a0All in all, not a great experience.

Here are a few survival tips so that you can have the best possible experience.1) If you don't queue up around 11-11:15 odds are you going to be waiting and on busy days that can be 2-3 hours. Telling you how long the wait is not a science. They have no idea if people are going to hunker down, order tons of food, etc. If they don't get it exactly right they're not being assholes. They will take your cell phone number and call you. Don't act like an ass and get in their face. Got to witness a group of 6-8 completely go off the rails about not being sat immediately. They have like 45-50 seats, that's it. Relax about it or get there early.2) If you're going to complain about the cost of the $25 lobster roll, don't order it. It is huge and the buttered version is really quite amazing. That being said, it is not the only lobster roll in the world. They have a plethora of other things to choose from.3) The Johnny Cake and Smoked Trout is not talked about much here. It is insanely good. It sounds weird but it might be the best thing on the menu.4) The great thing about the place is the atmosphere. Relax and take it in. If you are just treating this like some tourist thing to do in Boston and go in and pound down a lobster roll and then head back off to the Freedom Trail you will likely not get it and feel like you didn't get your money's worth. Have a glass of Muscadet and order a selection of oysters (their taste descriptors are incredibly accurate) and ease into the whole thing. 5) If you got auto-gratted you probably deserved it for some reason. They get stiffed on tips there a lot and not because they aren't good servers. Go to Miami. You'll get auto-gratted on your take out latte at lots of places. If they hit you with an auto-grat you were either a big group or a person who clearly was planning on the no tip route.In short I love this place.

The long awaited lobster roll was very disappointing. Our waiter recommended the hot lobster roll, so that's what we went with.

ASK if they are sold out of lobster. on our first attempt to eat here, we went in at 7 pm, with an hour wait, by the time we were called for our table only to be told that they were out of lobster. we were going SPECIFICALLY for a lobster roll, so this was like OMG DEVESTATING news. I left heartbroken, but live and learn.... if you are waiting for a table and give your phone number, they can call you if they run out in the meantime to give you a heads up in case you would like to make other plans.2. go as EARLY AS POSSIBLE. don't show up at 8 pm and expect them to still have lobster. this place gets BUSY and things do get sold out, despite what the hostess may tell you - when we made our second attempt at dinner here, we were told \"that never happens!\" well guess what, it happened to us! we knew better to play it safe next time and go directly from work for an early dinner.do this and you will have no problem.", "Date": "2010-08-14", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Bob W.", "ReviewID": "qJQzhRmpQu7IWguHZPkZBQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This place has good selection of oysters but the staff, especially the women behind the bar are horrible. \"Don't move the chairs we need to squeeze as many tourists in as possible\".

It was a lot smaller than we had anticipated; only around 8 two-person tables and a bar that seats around 13. It was a half hour wait, so we explored the bay and waited until they called us. After 45 minutes, we were sitting down. There were only 2 servers, and one of them was the hostess as well, so don't expect fast service when you go here, especially on the weekends.

We ordered a pair of WellFleet, Katama Bay, East Beach Blonde, Tatamgouche, Summerside and Ninigret. All were delicious but three of the most memorable in terms of taste were the WellFleet - sweet butter finish, Summerside of cos from Malpeque PEI with a nutty finish and Ninigret - a sweet pea finish. The oysters were $2.40-2.90 a pop but it was well worth it. We were not feeling full for obvious reason but we had an early dinner planned so we wanted something light - the waiter recommended the fried oysters with white sardines salad - it was interesting with a sweet finish. I thought it was a bit overpriced in general given it's just a bar type place but the food was good.

We started with oysters and ceviche from the raw bar which were nice. Oysters were fresh with a good selection. The lobster roll was delicious but OMG the scallops. Why do people not yelp more about the scallops. I had 3 lobster rolls while on this trip. I had one at Quincy market, yankee fish market, and at neptune. All 3 places did a nice job though Neptune was best, but truly we should be discussing the scallops more than the lobster roll. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the accompanying flavors were unique and tasty. Anyhow, the service here was wonderful. My water glass was always full and i felt welcome to continue to order and sip my drink even though I had been there a while and there was a line forming out the door. I had dinner at another Boston \"line out the door\" restaurant that week and scarfed down food because I could feel the waiter's sense of urgency to turn over my table.
