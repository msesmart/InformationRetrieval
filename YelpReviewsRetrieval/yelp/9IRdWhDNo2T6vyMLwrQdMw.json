When you enter they have large menu boards posted and depending on what you are getting you get in that line which expedited the process. If line gets too long they open another one in your area and someone comes along and starts taking your order writing it on your take out bag. Service is quick and friendly.Food was yummy. Tables outside, inside, out back and upstairs so lots of seating.Condiment bar would be my one negative as it should have plastic ware, mustard, mayo etc and it only had ketchup and napkins.The hit dogs were excellent and the ribs juicy and tender. Prices are phenomenal and for 3 people and $30 you cannot finish all the good.Definitely will be back here again when in Chicago to try some of their other well known food items and hope they are as good.Don't expect a fancy dining experience but if looking for some local comfort food this is the spot.", "Date": "2014-07-16", "Author_Location": "Apollo Beach, Tampa Bay, FL"}, {"Author": "Jay Y.", "ReviewID": "GueoYroWrpN1bx3oR9NgwQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In this retro marketplace-like interior, Portillo's is a great place to hang out with friends or take someone on a casual date! Of course, what's even more awesome about this place is the famous Chicago hot dog.This was my first place where I have my first Chicago hot dog, and I was not disappointed! Even though the line was a bit lengthy at first, I reached the counter quickly and got my hot dog after only a short period of wait since ordering. Portillo's classic jumbo hot dog comes with more toppings such as onions and pickles, so it was deceptively filling.

First, I didn't do much research about the restaurant (other than the fact it's a must visit) and didn't realize it was actually a sit-in cafeteria style restaurant. You order your food and then just find a seat somewhere inside. The restaurant is big so it's easy to find a seat and it's also nicely decorated. The decor really gives it a Chicago feel with the sports banners, photos and lit up neon signs.Second, the restaurant is more than just about hot dogs. They serve hot dogs, sandwiches, burgers, salads and drinks (smoothies, shakes, malts) and each type of food has a wide selection! I really wished I had a bigger appetite when I was there because they had quite a few attractive sounding items I wanted to try!The only item I did try though was the Hot Dog (Chicago Dog) because it's supposed to be the rave. My friend, who warned me about Portillo's, was right in that their poppy seed hot dog bun was a bit soggy, but that's expected since they state it's a steamed bun. I didn't mind the little bit of sogginess at all. The hot dog exceeded my expectations because it was actually really good and it seemed like your typical classic Chicago Dog with the mustard, relish, onions tomatoes, sport peppers and pickle. I can't say it was spectacular, but it hit the spot for what it was worth. It was what it was, a hot dog with lots of toppings.", "Date": "2014-06-30", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Craig Z.", "ReviewID": "O7p8GL7e1bqrCp_h17_D_g", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Food is good, but the experience really sucks.

Maybe it was those differences, or maybe my palate is numbed and wearied by my advancing age or maybe we hit Portillo's on a good day, but, whatever the reason, that was a much better sandwich than before. It was a big, damp mess, but tasted good and was satisfying. The wife got a chili dog, the kid got a plain dog and a shake, and we all got fries. These things were all average and unremarkable. That's a problem for a hotdog-fries-shakes place. In the end, I'm glad I didn't heed my own advice to get a hotdog. In the end, I find that my original three star rating accurately reflects an average restaurant in a city with much better offerings.

People talk about the hotdogs here--rightly. What I will talk about is that this place has the best fast food chain establishment cheeseburger I've ever had. I don't know quite what it is. It's huge. The veggies on it taste fresh, there is a perfect balance of all condiments. I love it. I am a bit of a connoisseur of cheeseburgers, but some days you don't want a special pretzel bun or bbq aioli or cage free eggs on top (most days I like things like that). Some days, you want a burger how you remember. No fuss. Big. Juicy. Melty cheese. Lettuce. Tomato. No nonsense. This place makes my favorite version of that.Shakes are awesome, also very nostalgic, although half the nostalgia might be from the fact that everything here is served out of styrofoam. The chocolate shake is my favorite and the chocolate cake shake is decadent. That needs to be eaten with a spoon. I should also mention that whenever I get a craving for cake, Portillo's is almost always my first stop. Example: I went to a child's birthday party recently expecting to endure lots of children, but at the end of it be rewarded with cake. What happened was that the host decided to serve cake pops instead because \"all anyone ever wants is just a bite\". Who put that crazy idea into this person's head? Needless to say I was tired an hungry by the end of that party. There is only one place in my area that I know of where I can get a chocolate cake (or piece of it) with chocolate frosting in a DRIVE THROUGH because I am hungry and won't get out of the car to eat it and that is Portillo's.Outside of that, fries are pretty standard and onion rings above average. Add on some cheese sauce for dipping into the order and you have an outstanding meal. It's a bit pricey as far as fast food goes, but totally worth it.

I'm used to the monster-stacked hot dog offerings that have been taking a foothold in Los Angeles.

I thought it would since I asked for everything but nope. When I noticed that the only condiment at the station was ketchup the liners were too long for me to go back and ask for mustard. I didn't want to be the jerk to skip everyone in line just to ask for mustard. Everyone has experienced that a-hole even though people let that guy skip in line to ask for condiments, people still think that person is an a-hole.

With no French bun or toppings, the delicious, thinly-sliced beef marinated in a wonderful herby stew received my full attention and appreciation.

His response was, \"okay, I am NOT taking you back to your hotel, I'm taking you to Portillo's!\" and what a great recommendation that was!The place is huge with precious, crazy diorama-type scenes hanging from the ceilings. They have multiple service lines depending on what you want(pasta, hot dogs, dessert, alcoholic drinks, etc.) so we went straight to the sandwich line. I got the Italian Beef, dipped like our pedicab guy said to do, with mozzarella and sweet peppers, and a slice of the Legendary Chocolate Cake to go because it really did look good. My boyfriend ordered the Italian Sausage and Beef sandwich, dipped, with hot and sweet peppers. Both sandwiches were huge to match our appetites and absolutely delicious!

Yet, we moved through the line within less than 10 minutes and about 5 minutes after that I had my food in hand. I credit this to the organization they practice. One person handing out menus as you walk in the door. The next person takes your order and writes it on a bag and hands it to you. Then, you wait to pay at one of four registers that are all staffed with quick cashiers. They take your bag, type up your order, beep-boop-beep, take yo' money and send you along to wait for your goodies. Numbers listed on receipts are called over a microphone, for you to pick up your now-filled bag (that they took your order on) and drinks are pre-poured into cups and labeled for quick passing.Looking around while I waited a couple minutes for my meal, I noticed a ton of cool decor including mannequins doing cute things like sleeping on a porch or sitting in the front seat of a car suspended by the ceiling. There are cutesy things hanging all over the place and really a lot of places to sit.Moving along, the actual sandwich is enormous. I mean..

Both are valid reasons to come here. If you are just craving Portillo's, I think there are locations that are run a bit better. The food and ambiance are awesome at this location, but it can be a bit chaotic and disorganized. (i.e. All of us ordering from Barnelli's - more on this distinction in a sec - had to ask for forks as they were out of them, and then the person managing drinks and distribution of food orders as they finished went across the counter and got take-out roles of plasticware)The food at this and any Portillo's location are great. There are the Chicago classics - hot dogs and Italian beefs. These are must-haves. I recommend Giardiniera on the beef if you like a spicy kick. I only recently learned that the availability of giardiniera across the city (even in Subway) is a Chicago thing. I also recommend asked for the sandwich dipped. It will make the sandwich messier, but it's so tasty. Nothing worse than a dry Italian beef sandwich (though some people like it that way) Besides the \"must-have\" Chicago classics, people love the Polish sausage or combination (beef with Polish). I also really like the chopped salad, which isn't a Chicago classic, but Portillo's is sort of known for it. I don't like that this location gives you bread vs. a poppyseed muffin that other locations give with the salad. I think the difference is if the place has a Barnelli's pasta bowl inside. If it does, like this location, there is a separate counter, and you must order and pay for a salad there. You will also get bread. I think.As far as food, I think you can't really go wrong. I personally don't love the cheddar and beef croissant though. I've been fooled a few times as I love all parts of the sandwich, but together it makes for a soggy mess that isn't worth it. Again, I recommend a dipped Italian beef for the best combination.Lastly, to get dessert or not? I usually don't, but I give in to the shakes sometimes.

I am still not sold that \"the Chicago dog is the greatest iteration of the hot dog and all other competitors need not apply!!!1!!\" as some people seem to be. But this seemed to be a pretty solid example of a 2nd City wiener. Better than the dog though, imhTo (T is for Texan), was the Italian beef. Drippy, messy, spicy, nasty, in the all of the best possible ways. I am always a sucker for a good giardiniera, and this certainly was. I probably could've come back for another one of those even though I was only in Chicago for a few days....oh that's right, I did!But on my return visit (on the way to the airport headed home), I also had something that was just as good as the Italian beef and probably better than the hot dog. The Maxwell St. Polish! It was toward the bottom \"Nice To Have\" (as opposed to \"Must Have\") section of the list, but should definitely be towards the top of yours! Deliciously topped with so many grilled onions, it was like have a french onion soup on top of a sausage (also pictured: mustard). Fantastic.As for the lack of \u00a05th star:- Chocolate Cake Shake was ok. So rich it would need to be split between about 20 people at 5-6 sips a piece.- Cheese fries were...decent fries with a side of whiz? Maybe because I come from the land of queso, where people do amazing things with cheese as a topping, I am spoiled. But these were nothing to write home about.- And my biggest gripe?!? The name is not pronounced \"Poor - Till - Os,\" with the till sounding like it was named after Chicago Bear, Charles Tillman. IT IS pronounced \"Por- Tee- Os\" (Spanish double L) with the middle portion sounding like something you would hit a golf ball off of. But every Chicagoan seems to be missing this.

I was getting very impatient. finally she yelled out what was in my order. i said it was mine and they never called the number. she snapped back at me telling me they did, a lot. I was especially listening for it since so many unclaimed numbers were being called out and i didn't want to make their job harder. I'm sure that somewhere on the line someone got the orders mixed up and thats why so many were being unclaimed and eventually thrown away. It's a mix up that shouldn't happen but it's understandable. What is not cool is the attitude thrown back at me. Like really lady? Other than that, this place has a great layout and a bar which is cheaper than most of the joints in Near North. I feel like i should say, as far as their food, it is great. However, if you are a Chicagoan and you are looking for some good REAL Chicago style eats for cheap, dont ever go here for that reason. There are tons of amazing, cheap places in the city to get a great dog, beef, or pizza done the right way at the right price.

My tastebuds thanked me profusely as the beef melted in my mouth and the light spicy peppers really added the extra flavors needed for a beautiful meal.For the Chicago dog, it may not be everyone's thing. They put a salad onto a quality hotdog on a toasted sesame bun - it's definitely not a nyc waterdog. There is literally a spear of pickle in the center and no ketchup. I know someone who likes to put ketchup on her ketchup, so this is definitely not her jam (er... ketchup).All in all, I'll be here again the next time I'm in Chicago.

They slab some cheese and sauce on it and tossed it in the oven. This was no better than a frozen pizza. YUCK.3) Ice Cream: Y-U-M. 2 scoop Chocolate or Vanilla on a waffle cone for around $3.50.

I stop by here a lot, sometimes after church, after a long road trip returning to Chicago, or just when some visiting friends are in town. The food is simple but different, rich and tasty. The location is welcoming and service is usually clear and prompt. The Italian Beef is a great, artery clogging, mouth-watering sandwich packed with meat and accented with peppers (hot or sweet at your choice). You can ask for extra gravy/jus on the side to make the sandwich even more soaked in some sweet savory goodness. The hot dogs are loaded with toppings and surrounded by a nice poppyseed bun; no ketchup of course. The pasta is actually pretty good too at this location; the tomato sauce runs a bit on the sweeter side if that's your thing. Salads and ribs are an option too; I've never bothered to try those but it seems like there's always a line for that side of the restaurant too. Busy hours can lead to a bit of a wait for something as simple as a hot dog and seating can be surprisingly hard to find too despite the size of the place. Three stars for great fast food.

Don't know what it is but it had to be good!Said Chicago guidebook had suggested Portillo's and after my mom and I got a massage it was time to fill our bellies. Portillo's is a chain fast food place. I wasn't expecting the food to be mindblowing but I figured it'd be a good pick me up. I was on a mission to eat Chicago centric food so I zeroed in on the menu in search of the Italian Beef and a hot dog. The hot dogs are mounted with foods I would have never thought of combining. Tomatoes, peppernocinis, mustard. I am more of a ketchup fan and I failed to find any. Come to find out it is sacrilege to put ketchup on your dog in the midwest. Despite the random toppings the hot dog was tasty. Who new tomato would be a great partner to miscellaneous meat? The Italian Beef was a sandwich with French bread and beef so tender and dripping with beef juice. Yowza! This made me happy I was eating meat again. While I did not order any alcohol I saw people with massive goblets of beer. The fact that you can order beer in a chalice gets Protillo's bonus points. I never thought I would be giving a chain four stars but Portillo's delivered much to my surprise. What I still need confirmation on is how is it pronounced?

What do you think? Without ketchup, there is no hot dog for me. Yes, I'm one of those ketchup snobs who won't eat a hot dog without ketchup. I bit my lip when I found out Chicagoans don't eat their hot dogs with ketchup. HOW COULD YOU NOT! It is the most common topping, especially if you're having a bbq. Now I just wonder how Chicagoans have their barbecued hot dogs. In New York, adding relish (and perhaps mustard) is already going over the top. Excited to see what this Chicago-style hot dog is about, I got the Jumbo Hot Dog (no ketchup for the first time in my life, of course) with everything. This was daring for me. I'm afraid of onions, mustard and peppers alone but for the sake of just to say \"I've had a Chicago Hot Dog,\" I sucked it up and took my first bite...without ketchup. I don't think I'll ever look at hot dogs the same way again. This was a life-changing moment. The fact that there were fresh slices of tomatoes and a dill pickles made me squeal - it certainly was a more \"natural\" way of having ketchup and relish. Within \u00a02 minutes, I finished this delicious, perfect hot dog, wanting more but couldn't stuff. It took only one to fill me up like a whole meal of McDonalds would take 2 different foods to. I slurped down a cup of their strawberry milkshake as if I've never had one in my life. I've been to many diners and none of them could top Portillo's milkshake. It was so smooth, and even though it's obvious it's made of blended ice cream, they blended it well, unlike diners who blend it half-ass. For only $2.59, you get a small (when it's actually a medium-sized) cup = score!The ambiance and atmosphere is so warm and friendly. I feel like I'm either at a beer garden, someone's backyard or in New Orleans. The place looks like a huge food court and I love the string lights!

I'm usually a healthy eater but when I'm not, watch out because I'll put down three chilli cheese dogs, a large fry and an onion ring.

The food has always been good to great quality, and always delicious. The over-carbing nap that follows is also sometimes a nice plus. This location is generally very clean, and even though the drive through sometimes wraps around the block, it moves predictably and at a decent pace.The only bad experience I had there was an incident around 9-10pm a little while back: I ordered my usual: 3 chilly cheese dogs, large fry and an onion ring. I know form experience that the longest thing to make on that list are the onion rings, so I was prepared to wait a bit extra for the deliciousness. I was the only customer there waiting for my food. The woman behind the counter first bagged the hot-dogs, then she bagged the fries (all within a few minutes) but had to wait about 6-7 minutes (in total) for the onion rings to finish frying (an eternity in fast food time.) One of the male employees was just getting off his shift, came over the counter where I was standing and in Spanish asked for the onion rings that were cooking. The woman then took the finished onion rings, handed them over to the employee, who then left, and started making a whole NEW BATCH for me. I was the ONLY customer in line. Another 6-7 minutes pass for this new batch of rings to finish, which she then bags happily and hands over to me.I'm not one to usually complain (I've worked plenty of years in fast-food) but this was completely unacceptable to steal a customers order while they are the only ones waiting, forcing a new order to be made. I asked for a manager and explained the situation.

I eat it, but I definitely don't crave it or seek it out. However, one of the staples of coming to Chicago is getting a dog and the most famous place of all to do it is Portillo's! So, as soon as my plane landed, I headed to Portillo's to eat lunch. I was a little confused by the setup at first, but then realized it wasn't just Portillo's but that there were other food options to choose from (it's like a food court). The restaurant is self service. You place the order, get your ticket, pick up your food and seat yourself. Apparently Portillo's is known for their exceptional service, but frankly no one was too friendly or seemed too thrilled to be there. The minimal interaction I did have was fine, but really it didn't matter anyways since I was here for the food. Like I said, I am not hot dog's biggest fan and on top of that, I don't like pickles, so instead of going with the traditional Chicago style hot dog, I decided to get the Char-Grilled Maxwell Street Style Polish. I actually like sausage dogs so this choice suited me much better. They claim that it is grilled in the traditional way it was done on Maxwell Street but since I have no idea where Maxwell Street is, am not Polish and have never been to Poland, it does not mean much to me, but it sure tasted pretty delicious. I am also not a fan of mustard but on this dog it was not overpowering and I am always down for some grilled onions.My boyfriend stayed away from the dogs and ended up with the equally famous Italian Beef. It was very good. I obviously have to compare it to a Philly Cheesesteak and frankly, although it was good, the Philly wins, in my opinion, but definitely fresh ingredients and good flavors.With all the hype surrounded by this place, I would assume the fries would be good too. I ordered a Large Cheese Fries and was expecting a good amount of fries loaded with cheese, not something I would describe as a small with cheese on the side.

The workers are out there rain or shine, warm or bitter cold and have everything moving quickly and orderly.+ The grilled tuna sandwich. Really, next time you're there check out the menu, it's really on there. It's so good, they're very generous with the fish and it's just so darn tasty. Comes with lettuce, tomato, red onion and tartar sauce - kudos for not slathering on the sauce.+ The cheese fries, they are so tasty.

Everybody was stuffed from lunch, but there's always room for chocolate after a meal! We walked to Portillo's to indulge. One of our friends ordered a slice of the \"famous\" chocolate cake; my other friend and I split the chocolate cake shake. While we were waiting on our shake, we were asked to help with the slice of cake since she couldn't finish it herself. What a daunting task...of course we gave in! Holy cow. This cake hit the spot in all the right places. It was an extremely moist 2 layer cake with the most perfect chocolate frosting. Right away, it reminded me of the chocolate cake recipe on the Hershey's Cocoa tin (which is my fav homemade chocolate cake). I couldn't stop \"helping\" her eat it, but I had to save room for this shake that I was anticipating.The shake was ready within minutes, and we dug right in.

Burgers are decent, they taste fresh. Chicken sandwich, not bad. The hot dogs? I've definitely had better. I never get dogs from Portillo's. I'll end with this... I'm born and raised Chicago, and I'm currently living abroad. Chicagoans seem like the only people that crave specific places and specific foods, from all the other Americans I encounter. I mean, we're the only ones that seem to talk about it all the time. Portillo's Italian beef is among the things that people talk about and crave for. I once packed one from a trip home and brought it to a very grateful friend who immediately inhaled it. Alls I'm sayin' is that it's something that people consistently talk about and crave from the Windy City and it definitely has a Pavlovian effect in that regard. So enjoy your Italian beef sandwich, enjoy your Chicago-only giardiniera, because there are many displaced Chicagoans who would kill for a bite.", "Date": "2010-09-14", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Teresa T.", "ReviewID": "QC0_lTVIZVR3vs2jVeL4bA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Stopped by for my very first Chicago style hot dog.

Whether you come for their hot dogs, or Italian beef, it is sure to please. The decor of this location has tons of memorabilia from the 20's-30's. The ambiance alone is something to enjoy leading your eyes astray at all the interesting things hanging from the ceiling and walls.There are separate lines, one for the hot dogs and Italian beef, another for \u00a0Barnelli's Pasta Bowl (Italian food), and another for beer. Most of the crowds usually get on the line for the hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. If you've never been here, I recommend picking up a paper menu before getting on line because it's almost impossible to see the menu board when the line stretches all the way near the entrance. \u00a0And when lines do get long, a staff member walks down the line, takes your order and writes it on a white paper bag. You hand the paper bag to your cashier to speed up the ordering process. Changes can be made at the register, but make it quick. After you pay for your order, you proceed down to the Pick-Up window, and wait for your number to be called. After you are done ordering, find a seat and begin feasting on a very gratifying meal.The first thing you have to get here is Portillo's Beef Hot Dog ($2.45) with everything on it: mustard, relish, chopped onions, sliced tomatoes, a quarter-sliced kosher pickle, and sport peppers piled on top of a snappy hot dog, all squeezed inside a poppy see hot dog bun. All the ingredients are fresh and work so well together. I would have never figured a Chicago dog with so many toppings would be so good, but it definitely trumps some of the gourmet hot dog restaurants trying to one up you by selling hot dogs for $10.The second thing you must get is the Italian Beef Sandwich ($4.85), thrown on French bread. By default, gravy is poured in the sandwich, referred to as Extra Gravy style. You can also order it Dry, with very little gravy, or Dipped, which the whole sandwich is dipped in their gravy. The Italian beef is tender and flavorful, but the gravy really takes it over the top. It can get a little soggy, but believe me, you're going to love it. You can also opt to add hot or sweet peppers at an additional charge ($0.45 each), which takes an already fantastic sandwich to out of this world status. I prefer to add hot peppers which adds a little heat. It's a hearty sandwich sure to satisfy most appetites, especially if you're ordering it with a hot dog. But for those true die hard Italian beef fans, Portillo's also offers a Big Beef ($6.39), which is a larger-sized version of the sandwich.The Cheese Fries (Large for $1.99 with Cheese Sauce +$0.65) are another nice addition. Potatoey crinkle cut fries complimented with a small container of Velveeta-like cheese. Mmmm mmmm, so simple yet so delicious!But a meal wouldn't be complete without a drink. If you don't want to go for the heavier shakes, their schooners of beer are a fantastic option. There is a separate line for alcohol, located just to the left of the hot dog/Italian beef pick-up window. I like to guzzle my hot dog, Italian Beef Sandwich, and fries, with a Fat Tire (Large Schooner - $5.00), served in a heavy-duty goblet-styled glass.I can't wait to get my Portillo's fix again.

However, you will see it in the price over other hot dog joints in the city. The french fries are really about as good as you're going to get in Chicago. The cheese makes them even better. The Beef (dipped) sandwich is the best in the city for my dollar. The cheesy beef on a croissant is unbelievable. Event the burger ranks among the best in the city. The chicken sandwich is solid if you're keeping it light and my wife loves the tuna sandwich. Throughout the years they've added some items that have really impressed.

Then, when he saw me take pictures of the place, he joked that there should be a picture of us, and reached for the camera, and took a picture of us behind the counter! lol never had that happen before. The hot dog was really delicious. fresh, crisp, and yum!! I had tried a chicago style hot dog earlier that day, so I knew a little of what to expect, and Portillo's didn't disappoint! The Italian beef sandwich was filled to the brim with the beef. soo much beef!! One thing I didnt like was that, we waited about 10 minutes before digging in, and by then the bread had gotten soggy. if you can, i suggest you get sweet hot peppers inside the sandwich, bc that would balance the pure beefiness of the sandwich!! beef was moist, thinly sliced, and savory. yum! Another thing was that we brought a pizza from Lou Malnati's and ate it there. there was a sign outside that sed \"no outside food\", but really, my friends and I were desperate to dig in and didn't want to wait unti lwe got back to the hotel room.

Many will argue that there are better beef and hotdog places in the area and while that may be true, Portillo's remains my all-time favorite. Chicago-style is really the only true way to eat a hotdog. If you're someone who likes ketchup, go somewhere else. Here you'll find delicious Chicago dogs and Italian beef sandwiches on the same menu.My usual at Portillo's are two Chicago dogs and an Italian beef sandwich. If I'm feeling especially hungry, I'll add on an order of crinkle-cut fries. Portillo's uses only Vienna Beef for their hot dogs, which come with a natural casing so you get that great snap. Their poppy seed rolls are warm and soft. The toppings are very fresh and full of flavor, without overpowering the taste of the Vienna Beef dog. Portillo's Italian beef uses thinly sliced beef cooked in the most delicious gravy. Many people like theirs with green peppers. I prefer mine with hot giardina relish. It adds a great crunch and spiciness to the sandwich. Try chili as a topping for your dog as a nice alternative to Chicago-style. It's very good at Portillo's.Honestly, I could go on about this place all day long.

Easy-peasy. \u00a0 On my 21st birthday, while attending college in Ohio, my sister had an authentic box of Portillo's hot dogs with all of the toppings shipped to my house. \u00a0Without question, it was the best birthday gift, ever.Last night the quest began. \u00a0Accompanied by one of my best friends and a fellow hot dog lover, I knew I had a simple, yet perfect Sunday night meal ahead of me. There was no need to look at the menu this time around, I walked up to the counter and ordered a hot dog with everything on it, regular cheese fries, and a medium diet coke. Upon my first bite, I welcomed the ideal \"snap\" that occurs when biting into a well prepared 100% beef hot dog, the bun was steamed to perfection, and the toppings were generous. \u00a0The only downside to a Portillo's hot dog is the lack of celery salt. \u00a0I love a good sprinkling of celery salt, and Portillo's gets points docked for that one. \u00a0Everyone knows a hot dog's best friend is a carton of French fries - and my cheese fries were delish. \u00a0Portillo's crinkle cut fries are always light brown in color and generously salted; paired with my unique mixture of cheese sauce and ketchup and they were a serious home-run. Overall, I give Portillo's a round of applause. \u00a0Their food is constantly good, time after time. Even though, I know it's not the best hot dog out there, it was still fabulous and I enjoyed every bite. \u00a0Portillo's was the perfect place to start my journey.", "Date": "2010-10-20", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sarah S.", "ReviewID": "A8BVbB3yiKqQX1eF7-vyGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a long flight from the UK to Chicago what more can you ask for that to immediately visit Portillos for a Chicago Hot Dog with everything on.These are like no hotdogs i've ever tasted and required me to visit on another occasion during our stay.

Never having a \"Chicago hotdog\" or even anything closely related to it, I jumped on this opportunity.I visited both this Portillo's and the one in Skokie, over the course of two days and tried two of the main staples.Chicago branch:First, I tried the Italian Beef sandwich. This bread stuffed full of beef was super moist! I liked it because it was slightly peppery. Another plus, was that meat was not too dry. Usually I have a probably with the meat being dry- but this one was quite juicy. Mmm. It was big, but I ate it all.I liked the atmosphere as well. As it's more of a fast food type of restaurant, it reminded me vaguely of a college campus food court. It was quick and the food came out quick as well.Only gripe I had about this sandwich was that the way it was wrapped + amount of oil in it, was horrible. This sandwich was so horribly wrapped- as I tried to unwrap it, all the juices and oil started flowing all over my hands, dripping onto the table, etcera. Additionally, the bread was even slightly soggy in places that related to the oil and juices.Skokie branch:Secondly, I tried the famous Portillo's Beef Hot Dog. I got \"everything\" on it, as I'm not a picky eater. It came with onions, mustard, a long pickly, tomatoes, jalopenos, and other items. I especially liked the poppy seed bun- made it an interesting eat. As I have no idea what makes a \"Chicago hotdog so good,\" I'm not sure how this hot dog appeared to other hot dog places.. but to me, it just tasted like a regular, slightly beefier hotdog, with good toppings. Worth it? Perhaps... but it was not mind blowing at all.Tried the fries.. and they were already. Quite potato-y, but could have used more salt, and I was hoping it would come out hotter.Everything else was fine though.Portillo's is the best alternative to the hot dog stand.

Here are two heads up (and the reasons for only 4 out of 5 stars): 1) they have, in the past, delivered all my food WITH NO CONDIMENTS. I had thirty starving people stoked about the cheeseburgers and fries, pouting about not having any ketchup (which I FULLY understand). Be sure to check before the delivery person drives away; 2) The beef sandwiches do not come pre-cooked. They give you a big greasy bag of cold/frozen beef, some random sauce, and no instructions of what you're supposed to do with it. That's a little disappointing.

At first we thought it was a food court and PHD was just part of the food stall. But then all of the stalls read Portillo's. There was portillo's dog, Portillo's salad, Portillo's BBQ, Portillo's liquor. It was confusing at first. But later we found out that all of the stalls are owned by Portillo's. Since we were there for the hot dog, we started to line up for the PHD.The line was very short considering a lunch time period (around 1pm). Then we saw on the wall a lunch special only for mon and tues. It was perfect timing since we were there on tuesday. For 5 bucks, I had italian sausage with fries and drink, while my family tried the polish sausage (original and special). The hot dog was a good portion. It was tasty and very meaty. It's different from hot dog place like Pink's in Los Angeles. Overall I think it's a good dog out of chicago. Later I found out that they have a branch out here in Buena Park, CA.

Chopped Salad- If I'm feeling healthy (or I'm with someone who makes me feel like I better act healthy) I get the chopped salad. \u00a0And damn is it good. \u00a0Something about the dressing- I adore it. \u00a0I love those little tiny noodles in the thing. \u00a0I love love love this salad. \u00a0A good chopped salad is hard to come by. \u00a0Many places make a \"chopped salad\" but usually it's a bunch of cheap ingredients tossed together with no flavor or substance. And now Portillo's sells the house dressing (which they put on the chopped salad) by the jar. So I can do my best to recreate the salad at home. Chocolate Milkshake- My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.... \u00a0Ummm, yeah, oh so good. \u00a0It's thick and chocolatey... sometimes a chocolate shake is (gasp) TOO chocolate for me. \u00a0I never liked Ben and Jerry's (and I have a friend who would kill me for thinking that) because it's too much chocolate. \u00a0Strawberry Milkshake- The best strawberry shake I've ever had. \u00a0Ever. \u00a0I suppose if someone makes homemade strawberry icecream and then whips the stuff into a shake it might be equal. \u00a0But I love this strawberry creation. \u00a0Refreshing and tasty. Chocolate Cake- Now no cake is as good as my mom's. \u00a0But this cake takes 2nd place... a close 2nd. \u00a0In fact, my mom once bought Portillo's famous chocolate cake for a family party instead of baking HER family famous chocolate cake. \u00a0so yeah, if nothing else, get a fat slice of chocolate cake. \u00a0It'll change your life. \u00a0Oh... And I am always amazed at the drivethru- it's like a well oiled machine- a choreographed ballet- graceful and flawless. \u00a0And I've never had them get my order wrong.OH... and these are by far the best pickles anywhere. \u00a0Ever.", "Date": "2009-03-31", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Angela M.", "ReviewID": "WiEGnBCrVzQlr_-2DcbAMw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sometimes you just want to eat a meal that tests the limits of your heart, and when that occasion arises I head to Portillo's.

I love the food but figure a one-star rating would catch some attention amongst all the 4s and 5s.On a few recent visits to Portillos (notably last night), I can't begin to describe the frustration experienced at the drive-thru. For those who've been down this road, it seems like a relatively organized and efficient system. No ordering through a speaker - alternatively each car has a different attendant personally come up, take the order and payment so by the time you reach the front of the line you're ready to grab your food and go.This, my fellow Portillo drive thru-ers is where the magic ends. The orders come out with no rhyme or reason so if you're not the first car in line you may get your food before the people in front of you. Sounds great right? Not so much. At that point, you are completely trapped in the drive thru line until every single person in front of you gets their order. Let's say theres a missing item for a car in front of you - tough luck, you're stuck. I'm talking 10-15+ minutes of sitting with your food in the car unable to leave. A more efficient system would be to ensure that food reaches the cars in order that they are lined up - this way your food would at least stay warm in the restaurant prior to being distributed out - especially when it comes to food like burgers and fries that lose their proper temperature fairly quickly. If you happen to drive up and there's no one in front of you - go for it.

It is just one of several places to get Italian beef, and my last few trips have been pretty bland and way overpriced....freaking $9 for a beef and drink. \u00a0No thanks. \u00a0And it has been declining in taste, in my opinion. \u00a0I don't give a crap about the hype, it's not a big deal for me. \u00a0And come up for a different name other than \"combo\" for the sausage and beef sandwich! \u00a0In every other joint anywhere a \"combo\" involves more than one food item, not just a freaking sandwich! \u00a0 But they nickel and dime you for every thing at Al's so it's no surprise they are oblivious to the concept of a combo meal. ugh. \u00a0(yeah, yeah, I'll post this on their review too).Al's on Ontario - good standby, plus they'll make it with my twists without any problem (unlike original above). \u00a0But, again, just okay, but I would have to say they have more courteous employees of the three.Now, I usually avoid the tourist mecca around Ohio/Ontario/Clark, but have been finding myself on business near Portillos (down the street from the second Al's) lately, and had yet another demanding craving for Italian beef again .....so I stopped in here tonight, a Monday, so the tourist crowd was to a minimum. \u00a0 And for my primary reason for this review ---- the Italian beef was freaking excellent - dipped with peppers. \u00a0AND the fries are really great, way better than either of the Al's. \u00a0Oh, and great prices for the area.Anyway, as a lifelong Chicagoan, I used to recommend visitors (going to usual spots anyway) have the authentic Italian Beef \"experience\" at one of the Al's.....not any more. \u00a0 Kudos Portillos!Minus one star for \"vacant\" attitude behind the counter. \u00a0Seriously, I didn't know if/when their employees were talking to me, their co-workers, the guy behind me......and when they do talk to you none of them look at you...kinda look past you.....freaking weird. \u00a0 Also, I've been through the drive-through before and that is a less-than-desirable experience. \u00a0Dine-in if you can.", "Date": "2009-11-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Nicole M.", "ReviewID": "WFOEae3GH0ezXaDYl0l3Dw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Whenever I'm craving a chili dog (no onions) this is where I go!I usually do the drive-thru at this location.

I don't eat them very often anymore but I have had them all over the country.One thing I wanted to do before my Chicago trip ended was get a genuine Chicago hot dog. I wanted Hot Doug's or Weiner's Circle or even Superdawg's but they're pretty far from my hotel and I'm not taking a cab to get some hoof n snout. Nor am I walking very far off the train in areas I'm not familiar with. I'm also a lazy American.A girl who works at the hotel I'm staying at suggested I go to Portillo's. So today I decide Portillo's will be my dinner. My (not so) trusty iPhone google map sends me up and over the river and down 2 wrong turns until I see the place. I had no idea it was the size of a friggin Costco!! Speaking of Costco - great hot dogs.I walk inside and see like 4 counters and some people. I guess they have a different counter for Italian food. I wouldn't want spaghetti touching my hot dog right? Well anyways, I ordered a jumbo with everything and a regular with everything. I went upstairs to the bathroom and when I came back to the counter my food was up. I like that. I schlepped it the mile or so back to the hotel and dove into the dogs.They were ok. The relish was lacking and not the neon green I'm told true Chicago dogs have. The tomato slices were lacking a bit but that's ok, I don't like them. The pickle spear was nice and crisp and probably the best part.So ok, pardon my babbling and horrible grammar. Overall, it was just ok. I was expecting it to be like a hole in the wall hot dog type place. I should have turned around when I saw the size of the place and the giant McDonalds and Hard Rock Cafe across the street. Yay! I have officially entered touristville. I like the off the beaten path hole in the wall places. We have enough chains in Dallas. So you get chain quality food in a chain quality environment at Portillo's. I don't think I'll go back next time I'm in Chicago.

I recently found out that they deliver, I was very excited to find this out because that means I didn't have to take public transportation to have their amazing food. So I ordered my food for delivery, and was a little disappointed because the delivery fee was a little high. After waiting longer than I should have to receive my food, I tipped the delivery driver and started eating the burger. After taking one bite into my bacon cheeseburger (which was great) I went for some of my cheese fries. I noticed that the fries were very soggy and cold, which was a huge disappointment!So after paying the high delivery fee and waiting WAY to long, I get cold/soggy fries. After this experience I have decided to never order Portillo's for delivery again, if I did it would ruin Portillo's forever! The next time I want a great burger, fries, or hot dog I will force myself to go into the restaurant instead of getting it delivered.

It was the only thing I had twice, and now that I think about it, it was the very first and also the last thing I ate there and I NEVER eat the same thing twice in one trip, so that should say something! As a result, I've mastered how to eat it without it falling apart everywhere.With 1,404 reviews so far, I'm not sure I have much more to contribute here but I drool just thinking about the Italian beef sandwich!! I can't say much for the other Portillo's locations since I only ate at this one but it is a chain and it probably is touristy but you find every kind of people here: tourists, locals, drunkards, stoners, young and old, families, etc. It's a little daunting when you first walk in because the set up is much like a food court with different stations every which way you turn: frozen custard/dessert \"booth\", a section for salad and some other stuff, another for *I can't remember but I think it was...* booze (I was too focused on getting my Italian beef), and then the main hub which is for the hot dogs, Italian beef, sides, shakes, etc. The lineup gets pretty long and there're staff who wander around and take your order, write them on paper bags which you then present when it's your turn to order. I don't get why since you have to re-order again when you pull up to the cash anyhow, but it's cute and it gives you something to do while you wait. A lot of people don't seem to catch on to the concept of a line up so it can get a little chaotic and you can end up waiting longer than is necessary for your turn. Oh, and they even have a drive-thru--I can't even imagine how long one would wait around for that~ After you place your order, you move to the left and wait for them to call out your order number, grab your food and find a table (or leave). There's one gal who works there who is so cute, she would call out orders and make up some kind of rhyme to go with it. \"Number 126, I got yo' fix!\" \"Number 224, I'm knockin' at yo' dowah\"~ The service is really friendly. I found people in Chicago to be unusually nice in general, which I can dig. But getting back to the Italian beef, I cry just thinking about it which I often do late at night when I cry myself to sleep about it. It's nothing complicated, just thinly shaved slivers of flavourful beef rammed into a bun and dipped (\"juicy\") in its jus. I'm pretty sure the non-dip option is there but if you're going to try one of these, you may as well get it right from the get-go and ask for it dipped. I ordered mine \"hot and juicy\" (if you get the bigger 9\" version, I imagine you'd have to ask for a \"big Italian beef, hot and juicy\". Call me a prude but I didn't think I could bring myself to say that out loud!) which comes with hot pickled peppers that aren't THAT hot but they are flavourful and do wonders. There are some pickled vegs (bits of cauliflower and carrots) that seem to accompany the peppers. If you've ever had a Montreal steak sub and love that beefy flavour, you will LOVE the Italian beef. I was tempted to get it with cheese but glad I didn't since the beef flavour is so savoury, I didn't want to ruin a good thing. It's pretty messy so you'd better mean business if you're going to have one of these but it truly is perfection on a bun. I only wish they'd use day old bread for the dip so that the bread wouldn't totally sog out by the time you find yourself a table, but given the volume that this place deals with, I'm not even sure where they'd store the bread to age!Sadly, I didn't get around to having their cake shake as there were so many things I needed to eat throughout each day and in such a short span of time that I was faced with life or death decisions and it meant no cake shake but I'm sure it's wonderful~ I also didn't go for the hot dog because on my first trip to Portillo's, I saw a few people eating one and it didn't look like anything special. First of all, it's a hot dog, and nothing more; second: the stuff they pile on doesn't make me wet my pants, and third: it just sounded like such an unnecessary production and I'd probably have to disassemble it as I ate it anyhow. Too much work for a hot dog, I say.So while some of you may be too good for chains and franchises, or touristy places, this one is well worth a visit. If you're too cool for it, you're really missing out! It's fun, cheap, and delicious junk food at its best~Tips re: the dipped: 1) You'll need two napkins per inch of sandwich. You're welcome. 2) Roll up your sleeves before you dig in. As soon as you pick it up, not only will the bread likely fall off in pieces, but it acts as a sponge that oozes jus, which is essentially melted beef fat! MMMMM!3) Don't be messing around: you need to eat this thing right away (ie, no take-out) as the bread will start to liquify immediately.4) Get it with lemonade, you'll feel less greasy.", "Date": "2013-04-25", "Author_Location": "Toronto, Canada"}, {"Author": "sabrinna s.", "ReviewID": "V-wsqOGX2cSGundMEhCtTw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was looking for something open late with good prices.

So we ordered/paid at the counter, then picked up our food and seated ourselves. Since I've had their Chicago dog before, I ended up going with their Italian beef. It's basically a huge roast beef sandwich with bell peppers (I opted for sweet but they have hot ones too). I also think the bell peppers were extra so maybe it's just a plain roast beef sandwich. Lots of flavorful pieces of beef and tender with not too much fat at all. I liked it. And a side of the cheese fries - nothing too much to rave out. They are just fries and they charge you extra for a mini container of what tasted like nacho cheese. For dessert, we got their frozen custard. Guess frozen custard is very popular everywhere except for the west coast so I've never had it before. But it tasted like a creamier ice cream to me. We had the strawberry flavor so had syrupy strawberry quarters and whipped cream and a couple of maraschino cherries. And best of all, everything is super cheap. Most everything is less than $5.

The dog had pickles, mustard, hot peppers, carrots, relish, & was on a sesame bun! \u00a0What it did not have was ketchup and I guess you're not suppose to have ketchup. It did not need it. I ordered the chocolate cake because I was advised by a few locals. It is definitely a must and glad I listened. I also tried their frozen custard. Both desserts are nothing you expect from a \"fast food\" type joint. The chocolate cake is so moist and frozen custard so silky smooth. My girlfriends have never tried frozen custard so they each ordered chocolate and vanilla flavored frozen custard. I prefer the chocolate over the vanilla. Also got to try their Italian Beef Sub and it was deliciously good. There's a lot of flavor in their beef. My advice is Don't waste your stomach space for any other fast food place. Prices are cheap. If you're ever in Chicago visiting, this place must be on your list. Like I said we arrived on Thursday and after that we went to a Portillo's Hot Dogs every day till we left on Sunday.

I am forever thankful for Dick Portillo for living the American dream and expanding his hot dog stand on North Ave. in Villa Park to over 20 locations in the Chicago Land area...and 2 in California to date. Yeah, Barnelli's is cool too and has been a hit since Dick introduced it, good pasta and salads, but real Chicagoans go for the beef (Hot Dogs or Italian Beef) When they visit Portillos. I enjoy a hot dog every now and then, Portillos has an outstanding one, but the real reason I come here is for the Italian Beef (No peppers, Wet, and Gravy on the side to be exact). Nothing but juicy, soggy, beefy goodness. The beef here is consistent, the gravy has just the right seasoning and the beef is always of good quality with a good ratio on the roll so you never feel that even though the business is expanding they are skimping like some places do. I take every who comes to visit me here, acting like a proud mama of how good the place is. Onion rings here are also a must when I visit. Not to doughy, sweet batter and not over or under done. They have lots of choices on their menu of different kinds of street food, I have ventured a few times from the beef, and it's always good, but its no Italian Beef. \u00a0A plus in my book is that they sell beer and wine and do have outdoor seating when it's nice out.", "Date": "2010-05-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mish A.", "ReviewID": "_c-bcqTPjvM4WDmGnnbWww", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just dropped by portillio's to try my first Chicago dog during my recent visit to Chicago.
