Came here with a group of four on a Thursday over the July 4 holiday and were seated in about 20 minutes. There were plenty of thrift stores around to browse as we waited, so it wasn't painful at all.Our server was Jason, and he was INCREDIBLE. Attentive, really friendly, welcoming, funny - overall a dude that I think you would imagine is that perfect server in a dream world, but never really can find. One of the key points of breakfast was the place's hot sauce that we low key wanted to steal, and then Jason joked that he would totally understand if he came back to find it missing. He got us. It was also reasonably portioned -- with each of us ordering hour own entrees and the French toast as an appetizer, we were stuffed (and it's hard to get me stuffed). I didn't get to try any of my friends' plates (we were all kind of hoarding our own food because it was SO DELICIOUS) but they each got benedicts they raved about.--Crunchy French Toast (appetizer/side) - I'm going to be honest -- I'm not a fan of French toast, but I LOVED this. The bread was the perfect texture - fluffy and light on the inside with a nice, soft crisp on the outside. The fruits were fresh, and everything combined so well with the dipping sauce. 10/10 would buy each time to split with the party.Kamil's Lunch (entree) - I was in the mood for something ultra filling and was worried that brunch foods wouldn't be enough, so I opted for the first goulash of my life (partially convinced by the word MACARONI shouting EAT ME in my face). Definitely the right choice for me. Savory but not salty, filling but not heavy (you know, when you don't hate yourself for being a person that needed to eat), with the most perfect balance of macaroni pasta with broth with tender, delicious, beautiful meats and vegetables. With the hot sauce too - oh man, this meal was unstoppable. I'm now a proud lover of goulash, and I can't wait to come back and try other new dishes because obviously this is the place to do so!", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "La Jolla, CA"}, {"Author": "Zoey O.", "ReviewID": "Nr1PXJ2aV6VUsW1kAyXKWQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a big fan of eggs benedict and was told this was a great place to try it!

I was not too impressed by the service. Yes, the restaurant was busy, but it seemed as if they were understaffed. Our server walked past the table at least three times before welcoming us. We asked for water and then told us the water would be right out when he came back to take our order. When the food arrived, we had still not gotten our water.

Luckily, there's nearby awnings and therefore shade while we wait so it's not too bad. The food is delicious and very well presented. We had their benedict, the risotto, crunchy french toast and a steak/hash sort of situation. All perfection! The eggs were all perfectly poached, too, which is just icing on a very delicious breakfast cake... well done, kitchen staff!The waitstaff is (servers AND bussers) SUCH PERFECTION! My water was never empty and our server, Martin, wasn't hovering over the table but just perfectly present and nearby and had a great sense of timing when it came to check on us. His demeanor, attitude and service was just so refreshing considering it was a busy morning and we were a table of 4. Hooray for none of the \u00a0Also, very random, BUT the water here is delicious.

Its the best breakfast sandwich ever! If you never tried it, its a must order then. We brought a friend with us, and he finished his plate including the potatoes before us! It basically has over easy eggs, strips of crispy smoked bacon, fresh avocado, sliced tomatoes, arugula, and pistou aioli on ciabatta. Must warn you though, it can get a little messy. So make sure you go with people that you're comfortable with. It also includes their crispy red potatoes. Almost forgot to mention that, if you can eat spiciness then you definitely have to eat it with their tabanero sauce! Another dish that is a must order is their blueberry pancakes. I think their pancakes tasted way better than their crunchy french toast. To me their crunchy french toast was a little bland. There was nothing special about that particular dish. We had their earl grey before, it tasted quite interesting. It smelled and tasted like cupcakes! Their Arnold Palmer are refillable in case you didn't know! I tried a couple of their juices, and they were pretty good and fresh too. Their might be a lot of people here but I noticed that the waits are never too long.

We ordered a savory dish, the eggs Benedict, to share as our second dish. I highly recommend ordering a savory dish because as amazing as the crunchy French toast is, it's sweet and great to have something to balance this out. We also ordered a side of the apple sausage which in retrospect we didn't need and was just ok.The French toast lived up to the hype, we ate every last bite!

Of course, there was a wait. Of course ppl got a lil antsy and irritated and rude. And of course I saw some nice eye candy (its LA, man). Finally after an hour (AN HOUR+) we go it in. YAYYY!!! One roommate mentioned the interior was a lackluster. He expected something different, something greater. We all agreed but I was more interested in the food. I ordered the BREAKFAST TRIO. The sausage was OK, the french toast was OK, small but thick (ladies), the bacon was very thin but juicy, I could have done without.. But the eggs; my good sir, the eggs were fluffy and bright and beautiful! Best eggs Ive had in LA (so far).Other than the uninspired inside, the staff was cool and cooperative and attentive and understanding. The \"hype\" and long lines are TOTALLY unnecessary.

It was amazing, and kind of interesting because it's a mix between traditional breakfast and my favorite type of salad, minus the salad greens. The potatoes that both dishes came with was very tasty. We also both had the french press coffee - strong and smooth.Very friendly service, but we noticed that some of the mugs and cups were dirty.

Hoping this is not a frequent occurrence.Besides that, this is the perfect place for brunch. Also appreciate that vegan options are available, and that they use nearby farms.

Even our bus boy was so cheerful. I loved that. \u00a0I understand that a great diner is worth the wait when you understand and appreciate food as much as I do. One thing put a damper to my morning was that a guy walked up to the front and bribed the host with $50 to put him to the front of the line. She took the bribe by telling him to walk in and buy a coffee wink wink.. Unfortunately, I was standing right there to hear it. So my wait continued. I think that every customer that is waiting should be treated fair and square. There were elderly people in line looking uncomfortable and children that were waiting. That one silly and greedy move of that one host can put a sour taste in anyone's mouth and swear not to go back again. Would I go there again? I enjoyed my food even though it was on the greasy side but, Id be going there a lot less then I normally would. When we find a good spot we become regulars. We are amazing tippers and appreciate good service, food and presentation. I can see how long waits can be a problem especially if there are special line jumps with bribery.

They have a \"waiting room\" with a few chairs and couches, which is actually pretty nice because the sidewalk area could get super crowded. \u00a0We ended up waiting a little longer than 20 minutes, probably close to 30...but I think it might be because we didn't specify that we'd be willing to sit inside OR outside, fail. \u00a0But the outside \"patio\" area seems kind of weird because it's just jutting out on the sidewalk with a little shade separating you from the other patrons waiting for their name to be called.ATMOSPHERE: The inside is fairly small and narrow, so I could see why there is usually a long wait. \u00a0The walls have lots of hollywood type pictures and paintings and it has a little of a rustic feel. \u00a0One yelper said this place screamed \"industry\" and I have to agree. We saw so many people who looked important or famous and a group of guys got picked up in a fancy rental car...and the people next to us seemed to be basketball players from out of town. \u00a0Too bad I didn't really recognize anyone. \u00a0ALSO apparently this is where that famous proposal video was filmed where the guy made a video for his girlfriend and she watched it at their favorite restaurant. \u00a0Yup, that's blu jam.Anyway, we got seated and the service was pretty quick. \u00a0I could see how the waitress could forget about certain tables and our water came out after another table sat down after us but that's okay.FOOD: We had to get the crunchy french toast of course and the italian breakfast risotto. \u00a0Their menu is pretty extensive and they had specials that day (nutella french toast!) but we didn't want to deviate from what they are known for since it was our first time. \u00a0Oh yeah, and they serve breakfast all day :)CRUNCHY FRENCH TOAST - It's served with fresh blueberries and strawberries and a vanilla dipping sauce. \u00a0The sauce is pretty subtle but my boyfriend said he could definitely taste the vanilla sauce. \u00a0I guess some might want syrup but I liked it with just a little bit of vanilla sauce. \u00a0The texture was AMAZING. \u00a0Usually french toast can be kind of soggy or spongey but the batter was crispy and tasty, the corn flakes maintained their crunchiness despite being dipped in batter and slightly fried. \u00a0It wasn't too sweet and was just..GOOD. \u00a0It's big enough for two to share but definitely enough for one person to eat the whole thing if you're hungry.ITALIAN BREAKFAST RISOTTO - Debated between this and the steak hash but glad we went with this. \u00a0The rice was chewy and delicious. I think of risotto as being super mushy and watery but each grain was perfectly formed still. \u00a0It had a pesto type sauce and sundried tomatoes and two perfectly poached eggs. \u00a0I could see why they call it \"Italian\" because all of the flavors together remind me of italian pasta or food. \u00a0Mmm, it was also very good.CHICKEN APPLE SAUSAGE - I felt like we needed some protein so we ordered this, about $3.95 for 3 sausages. \u00a0They were super \u00a0tasty and added that savory meat flavor we needed to complete our brunch. \u00a0They weren't shriveled up or like it was all skin and no meat.Overall, I'm not usually a big fan of brunch and feel it's overrated but this crunchy french toast and the rest of the dishes we tried definitely met me expectations and a little more. \u00a0I could see why people would be adverse to waiting over an hour for their food but if you come on an off day it's definitely worth it.", "Date": "2014-04-19", "Author_Location": "Irvine, CA"}, {"Author": "Jem K.", "ReviewID": "-Umia7rQT-nWt18ld2ETog", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "my boyfriend ordered the french toast (and he doesnt like bread) but he finished it! i ordered the Florentine Benedict with the side of mixed veggies (i hate veggies) but i finished it. thats how delicious they are. lol :) very tasty. they were also kind enough to draw something on our latte (mocha and vanilla) even when they said they were busy and not sure if they can decorate it. :)", "Date": "2014-07-09", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Elizabeth N.", "ReviewID": "xSOQ07FgcTImFVGZVKJiKQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Obviously this place is a staple in Los Angeles and there will always be a wait.

Definitely the best french toast i have had in LA in the last 2 years. - Migas..delicious but salty. \u00a0 The ingredients were fresh and highly satisfying. the problem was the salt rebound after the meal. I felt like I was chugging water for the next hour (and I am not \u00a0salt sensitive person). - Early grey tea was well above the average early grey.

The corn flakes were nice and crunchy and the bread itself was so soft. The Vanilla Bean Sauce on the side was a great addition. It had a strong vanilla taste but not in an overpowering way. Also, not too sweet and way better than regular maple syrup!The other spectacular dish was the Florentine Benedict. Another great option, especially if you're leaning toward the savory side! I felt pretty healthy eating this version of a benedict since the ham was replaced with large heapings of sauteed spinach!

If it is, they nailed it perfectly. I'd recommend sharing the crunchy french toast along with a savory dish like the steak hash between 2 people.

The only downside to this place is the super long wait, but they do have a shaded waiting area which is nice.

However the wait sucks, the parking situation sucks.Park around the neighborhood - it's a 2 hour parking until 8pm (if you read the signs) There are different signages, yes, even across the street. So make sure you're reading ALL the signs before you leave your car. You might come back to a terrible surprise in the form of a $$$ parking ticket.What I had - Coffee. Yes. In a HUGE mug. Just right up my alley.Norwegian Benedict \u00a0(Toasted English muffin, smoked salmon, poached eggs, saut\u00e9ed spinach, tomato and dill hollandaise, served with potatoes). Instead of potatoes I opted for a side salad instead. A girls' gotta watch her figure right? SO delicious. Has to be one of the best tasting Benedicts I have had in a LONG time. num num num num.Friend had - Migas (gluten free) eggs scrambled with jalape\u00f1os, chipotle, beef chorizo sausage, red bell peppers, tortilla chips and mozzarella, topped with homemade tomato salsa, served with corn tortillas and potatoes. It was pretty spicy, but it tasted sooooooo good. It's a nice scramble with a kick. Yessss. May be what I order next.We came around 2ish and the wasn't too bad nor long. I think if you pass the 1ish, noonish rush, they're not as busy, plus they have time to devote to you. Btw, this place is open til 4, 7 days a week. Not sure about holidays and what not... since you should be home! Not at work or having brunch. hahI haven't been back for the lunches, but they looks sooo yummy.

Their water has lemon and mint in it, although I couldn't really taste the mint. Still a nice touch. Everyone I've met in LA has been so nice. We left a generous tip. Food: We each ordered our own dishes and shared the Crunchy French Toast. They have large portions, basically enough for 2 people per entree. According to my friends, Roma via Paris - just OK. Vegan Burger - good flavor. As I said, V had the Eggwich, and there's literally nothing else that could have given her food poisoning. It must have been from the egg. She's been sick and unable to hold down anything she eats for the last 3 days, and I'm not sure how long this will last - kinda puts a damper on her vacation. It's like she's unintentionally bulimic right now. Crunchy French Toast - 8 pieces, good for sharing. As the name says, crunchy.

That's insane! We gotta do it\" Peer pressured into the \"ultimate\" LA brunch experience i said \"Alright, Alright\"Finally our group was seated (more like an hour later), but the hostess always kept us informed and with a smile on her face, though the environment was conducive to bad attitudes and short tempers because of the large crowds and busy influx of hungry humans.The inside though jam-packed with people, did not feel claustrophobic or cluttered. The tables were spaced out enough that the floor plan, did not feel crowded, there was plenty of room for the server and bussers to comfortably move around with ease around the tables.I ordered the huevos rancheros which were delicious though very spicy. If you don't like spicy food i don't recommend them but otherwise they were fantastic. My eggs were over easy. The tortilla layer at the bottom was just the right amount of crispy and soggy from soaking up the sauces and the yolk.My friend ordered the Mac n' Cheese which was also exquisite though so rich in flavors and textures that i recommend you order the dish to share. Maybe too much for one person, as well as one note when it comes to flavor palette. But don't get me wrong- that one flavor of cheese and ham and bacon was delicious! It just became repetitive after the fourth bite. No new notes or textures, but still extremely well made, well put together and very tasty. Just not too complex as far as technique.And now to the best dishes, and the main reason Blue Jam Cafe deserves FIVE stars:1) the Breakfast Burger. Has to be one if he best burgers i have ever had. The depth of flavors, the complexity of textures, the bun, the quality of the meat! The only thing i could do without is the side of roasted potatoes. The roasted potatoes are really nothing special. Maybe a good side of French style Frittes would accompany this beast of flavors quite well.2) the corn flakes French toast. One of our friends tasted it before i did and i watched her face and thought \"she's gotta be bullshitting at least 10%. There's no way that this dish could make anyone make such exaggerated facial features. I mean, it can be good, but how good can it really be?\" HOLY SH*T! It was incredible!!!! The perfect amount of crunch, the perfect amount of sweetness. the perfect amount of tart from the confit fruit. the perfect amount of creamy (from the milky sweet substance it is served with instead of syrup-sort of like a condensed milk but much lighter in flavor and density).

I figured all the people would still be in bed from spending the entire night out in Hollywood. Boy, was I WRONG. People were up and crowding all over the entrance at BJC. My party of 2 probably waited around 30 min. Although this place isn't very big, turnover seems to be pretty frequent. You shouldn't have to wait long if your party is 4 or less.Since my friend brought her pooch, we sat outside on the patio. They have a ton of breakfast items and I love how they even have a healthy and fit menu for the people who are watching what they're eating. One thing stood out to me and it was the steak hash which had steak, potatoes, mushroom, gorgonzola, poached eggs and hollandaise. When my order came, it was a very generous portion with a bright green hollandaise sauce. It was purrrrrdyyy and delicious! I added some dashes of the Tabanero sauce they had at the table which added a bit more tang. It was tasty and filling. I took about half of it home to save someone the trouble of rolling me out to my car. BJC is right in the heart of Melrose and it's very well known. It's BUSY so be prepared to wait. The menu is pretty extensive, the food is good, and I didn't have a single complaint about the service. Everyone who worked there was very friendly.

The Blu Jam Benedict is a more standard Benedict with ham. It's not anything special but it was yummy and I'd definitely order it again! :) The huevos rancheros was a little different.

I ALWAYS remembered how delicious their eggs benedict & French toast were, but could never remember the name. However, after some detective work, Yelping, and Googling, I found Blu Jam at long last!- FIRST IMPRESSIONS/PARKING: Blu Jam is ALWAYS bustling, kind of cramped, and definitely loud. However, I love \u00a0the charming atmosphere because 1. it feels like I'm over at a friend's apartment and we're all making/eating brunch (if we could cook half as decently as the cooks here) together and 2. the place itself is decorated in a way that makes it feel intimate, yet trendy and casual. Parking can be pretty bad, but if you search around for street parking, you should be able to find available spots (or at least cars that are leaving)- SERVICE: We came here this past Saturday for brunch before we went shopping at The Grove (party of four around 215pm). Our host was very charming, friendly, and funny and quickly greeted us (despite having so many tables to attend to) and gave us an estimated waiting time of about 15 minutes (surprisingly short wait time even though they were bustling). We walked around and explored some shops while waiting, until they called, well actually texted, us that our table was ready (trendy, easier way of telling us when to come back instead of making us wait there). Also, they give your party about 3 minutes to respond to the text before they give your table away (unless you tell them you need some extra time, then they're happy to oblige)- FOOD: AMAZING. I ordered the Crunchy French Toast, my boyfriend ordered the Blu Jam Benedict, aaaaaand I can't remember what my other two friends ordered but I'm 100% sure they loved it. As soon as our food came (really fast by the way) everyone whipped out their phones to take photos because everything looked SO good. As we started eating, conversation died down and was replaced by a chorus of \"mmmMMMMMmmm\" as everyone indulged in their slice of heavenly delight.My french toast was PERFECT and tasted even better as I drizzled the warm, melted condensed milk on it. (my mouth is actually watering as I'm writing this). My boyfriend, who hates poached eggs because of the yolk, LOVED his eggs benedict. Upon his first bite, he exclaimed, \"holy sh*t this is GOOD\" and continued to eat until his belly burst.- OVERALL: Blu Jam is AMAZING (not surprising how many awards they have). Their entire staff is GENUINELY dedicated to making your dining experience fun and the food is PERFECTLY SCRUMPTIOUS.

Brunch = bliss. That said, Blu Jam Cafe does brunch right -- heck, they're only open until 4PM because they only serve brunch!PARKING -- There's plenty of metered street parking on Melrose and in the residential areas.WAITING -- On a Sunday morning at 11:40AM, there was a long line formed outside the restaurant just to put their names down on the waiting list. It turned out to be a 45 minute wait but you're free to browse the cute boutiques on Melrose while you wait because the restaurant notifies you via text when your table is ready! If you decided to go elsewhere by then, you just reply back to the text with a \"3\" and they'll give your table to the next party. Just remember to be in a 3 minute radius to claim your reservation.SEATING -- When putting your name down on the waiting list, the employee will ask you if you prefer outdoor, inside, or first available seating. We said first available and was seated outside and I'm so glad!!! I love natural light and the summer morning was perfect for the al fresco dining! When I went inside the restaurant to use the restroom, it was cute and homey but I would still prefer outdoor seating any day... so if you're not in a hurry, choose outdoor dining :)FOOD -- Amazeballs. We had the Crispy French Toast, Norwegian Benedict, and mocha lattes. The Crispy French Toast was nothing like I've ever tasted and perfect complement of crispiness on the outside with the cornflakes and softness on the inside with the brioche bread. I substituted the potatoes for a fresh fruit cup for free! The Norwegian Benedict was too salty for my liking and my poached egg was on the firmer side. If you're a fan of eggs benedict with smoked salmon, try Poach di Parma at Urth Caffe! The mocha lattes are good here too and come with latte art!SERVICE -- The employees here are so helpful and friendly! The moment I stepped inside the restaurant to use the restroom, I was scanning the perimeter for not even 2 seconds when an employee asked me if I needed any help! Likewise, I saw on Yelp that the lattes came with designs so I asked the waiter if they still did that. He replied that they might depending on how busy they are, but he'll ask.

If you are looking for the perfect brunch place and you find yourself in LA, on Melrose, look no further than Blu Jam Cafe. My boyfriend and I are in Orange County, but try to go up to LA every so often to trek Runyon Canyon. Every time, we opt to try a new brunch spot in the city after our hike. This time, we came across the Blu Jam Cafe. We were reading online that the wait can be very long, but we had nothing to do all day, so we figured we would deal with it. I am SO glad we did. Honestly, we waited 40-45 minutes, and there was a ton to do nearby - lots of second hand clothing stores, and other little boutiques to look at. I guess I was probably more excited to explore those places than my boyfriend...But he tagged along and was a good sport about it. When our name was called, we were seated and brought fresh water right away. They stuck some cucumbers in our water, so it was like having some fresh spa water, at no cost. That was an added bonus. Our server(s) were both extremely nice and helpful when it came time to finding something to eat. At the time, I was counting macros, and I LOVED that they had a \"get fit\" section, where they included the macro count of the dishes on that side (P, C, F, Cal). I didn't have to guesstimate as to what was in what, how much, etc. It was also nice as we had just done the hour hike in the heat, so we wanted to be semi-conscious of what we were eating. I got the Far East Tofu Scramble, and my boyfriend got the Muscle Beach. Mine was...heaven. It was definitely an interesting combination of flavors (eggs with curry, and dried chile, etc.) but the flavors blended so well together. It was a perfect ratio of tofu, rice, and all the fun veggies. MY boyfriends was pretty simple -- egg whites, toast, cottage cheese -- can't go wrong with that. He also ordered a coffee at the end, which he said was pretty d*mn good. I don't drink coffee, so I have to trust his opinion. Protip: don't wait until you REALLY have to use the restroom, because there is only one for girls, and I waited in line, doing my dance, for about 20 minutes for that girl to get out of there.

Though, not gonna lie Blu Jam Cafe might be the undisputed Hipster Breakfast joint for all Angelinos and let me tell you why I'd only come here once in a blue moon..Patrons: It's in Hollywood. Actually Hollyweird.. (Wannabe actors, Transplants, Pretentious and Elitist HOT Asian girls, Asian tourists, and couples) *No reservations by way* (I'm not talking about the Anthony Bourdain show by the way) The Wait: Fuckin' long. As in \"Disneyland 45 mins long but without a fast-pass\" long. Prices: If you're a poor ass college student or only have a $20 on you. You might want to re-think where you want to eat this morning. The majority of their menu items are over $10 for breakfast. It's decent for the working class though if your MAMA taught you how to be frugal then I suggest Norms or Dennys. Ambiance won't be the same FYI. Food: Amazing. Blu Jam Benedict: I'm like an Eggs Benedict Snob. Had extremely high expectations. Extremely tasty. A bit skimpy in size but it made up for it with the crispy pieces of bacon, perfectly poached egg, and amazing Hollandise Sauce. Jessica Y. and I are very critical when it comes to Hollandise sauce and it lived up to the hype. Kudos. Brunch Burger: Good sized burger with great taste and very Taiwanese in the sense that they put an Egg in it. I was thoroughly impressed and it was a mighty fine burger with all the fixings. Highly suggested.Service: Not bad. This place is always slammed with either the wait or even when you're at the table. Overall, this place is pretty good. The only thing I don't like about it is the wait and the size of the Eggs Benedict cause I like my shit HUGE. If you're not down for waiting but want to try a similar style breakfast place I recommend Square One dining. It's AMAZING.

You get a lot of attention from the staff because they don't have as many people to attend to.They have a full juice bar, and they are famous for their French toast and their eggs benedict. As I'm not a fan of cinnamon, I rarely ever try French toast, though I was really tempted this time. My friends ordered the \"crunchy\" French toast with cornflakes on the outside and fresh berries. It made me want to take a huge bite, but I had to save room for my eggs benedict! So glad I did.The Blu Jam eggs benedict has ham and bacon on an English muffin, and it is seriously delicious. Dare I say it? Phenomenal. Quite possibly one of the best benedicts ever. Yes, both ham AND bacon. The bacon is crispy, but not too think and not burnt. It's the kind of bacon I have dreams about. The hollandaise is fantastic; it has the perfect consistency and flavor. Every aspect of that benedict was spot on. I will most definitely be back here!I got super lucky with parking. I nabbed a spot on the street, directly in front of BJC.

The juice came out quickly and was delicious, I gulped it down immediately. The omelet came next and was tasty and fluffy. We were very excited to try our order of Crunchy French Toast since so many yelpers raved about it. When it came out, it looked dry. We drizzled a little of the oily looking whitish yellow (vanilla/butter?) syrup that comes with the toast, on top of the toast. This didn't do much to improve the moistness. It wasn't \"crunchy\" as much as it was \"dry,\" \"rubbery\", and pretty darn \"unimpressive\" And frankly, the white/yellow syrup got a little more gross looking the longer we sat there.

My friend and I called BJC to check how long the wait for two would be (this was at noon), and the host said about 20 minutes. We got there in five minutes, parked on a residential street around the corner, and were seated immediately! No wait at all? Already off to a great start.The friendly waiter immediately served us iced water and handed us some menus. He graciously returned in a few minutes and asked whether we were ready. We were still deciding amongst the many, many options, though. So when I signaled for his attention a few minutes later, he immediately caught it and came over, ready to take our order. I liked this guy! So prompt, so friendly, and so prepared. We chose the California omelet with a side of fruit salad (can choose between mixed greens salad and fruit salad; also choice of rye, sourdough, or whole wheat toast) and the crunchy French toast (per Yelpers' recommendations). In under 10 minutes, our food came out. Immediately, I was stunned by the beautiful presentation of the French toast (cut into triangles, each piece separated from the next by banana and strawberry slices and a handful of blueberries) and the neat (there's really no other word for it) presentation of the omelet and its accompaniment. At this point, we asked the waiter to just leave both dishes in the middle (so friend and I could share), and he already knew to bring us extra plates! So on top of everything.For the next half hour, we indulged in breakfast/ brunch heaven. Famished and excited, I dug into the golden omelet and ravished in the wonderful bits of bacon and chunks of avocado as well as the oozing tomato basil and other sauces within this piece of, well, heaven. Then I tried the crunchy French toast, which is kind of like fried French toast, really, but considerably less oily than one would expect! I'm proud to confirm that the taste of the dish did not betray the looks of it. The crunchy French toast was beautiful--inside and out. I loved that the egg wasn't overdone, that the French toast wasn't oily, that the fruit was fresh; that the wait was short to nonexistent, that the service was awesome, that the prices were decent. For a total of $28 (excluding tip), the two of us attained total satisfaction in both food and service departments. I was so happy that I didn't even mind being 50 minutes late for work and paying $11 for parking afterward. I absolutely cannot wait to come back!

ALSO, the food came out relatively fast given the crowd so that was a plus as well!I got their spring omelet which was a weekly special and i got it with egg whites! They are also accomodating to any customizations/substitutions you might make so I was happy (: \u00a0The omelet was good!! pretty standard and filled with lots of veggies which i enjoyed. It came with your choice of toast as well as potatoes(but you can substitute for fruit or salad). We also got the crunchy french toast to share with the table and it was pretty good as well.... I LOVED the texture and the vanilla sauce so I would say it lived up to its hype!overall, probz wouldnt come here with a big group or on a weekend again... but it was good!", "Date": "2013-04-08", "Author_Location": "Rowland Heights, CA"}, {"Author": "Courtney W.", "ReviewID": "FRLMHArWfCD-i_hHg4-2Cw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went here last weekend.

We were 30 minutes into the wait and the waitress brought out pieces of their signature dish to make sure we were happy which was totally unnecessary (Unless you're a complete selfish twat like the jerkface next to me who was talking loudly into his cellphone about how ridiculous a 45 minute wait was. I mean, the restaurant is basically saying, \"We apologize that we're so popular that you have to wait\". Sod off.). After we got seated though, it was fairly quick and easy to order and get our food. \u00a0I came here with my girlfriend and she ordered their signature \"Crunchy French Toast\" which is a brioche french toast that was battered and covered with corn flakes served with fresh fruit, a little dash of powdered sugar, and a vanilla bean dipping sauce. \u00a0I'm not much of a sweets kind of guy so there was definitely a small dilemma in ordering where I ultimately settled on the \"Migas\", a scramble of eggs, chorizo, and some other stuff. \u00a0From the description of the dish, it sounded like it would be pretty spicy but it wasn't at all. \u00a0However, they did have this salsa on the table that was unbelievably good. \u00a0The tortillas definitely made it so that I could have it in the form of breakfast burritos/tacos and was just the right portion. \u00a0The scramble had a side of potatoes that really helped balance out the flavors so it didn't feel too oily or that you had eaten too much eggs. I also ordereed the single origin french press (Columbian for the day), and it wasn't too bad. I didn't stick long enough to find out if they do refills due to the parking situation there (see below).Service was good. The people were super friendly beginning with the free samples of Crunchy French Toast (Note: the samples were a bit soggy because they poured the sauce on it, but are actually really crunchy when you do order it as a meal) all the way to the table service. The guy who served us was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. Parking in the area can be a bit of a hassle though. The surrounding neighborhood on the side streets are a 2 hour parking only so when you include a 45 minute wait during the rush hour, you'll probably only have enough time to kind of leisurely enjoy the meal unless you can find parking on Melrose.Food: 4.5Service: 4.5Price: 4", "Date": "2014-03-27", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Jennifer P.", "ReviewID": "gM1I0SmnTYvyVCTBwkZB5Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Key is to arrive as early as 9am to avoid a long wait.

The portion was pretty big too, I finished everything on my plate (so good that I had to finish) but I was stuffed when I was done! My friend got an omelette and it was HUGE! She only finished half of her omelette and she had to get a box for the left over. Her dish came with a side of either toast or fruit and some other options I think but I forget. She got a side of fruit and it was a good amount of fruit for it being a side and it looked really fresh.  Their service was really good being that there were a TON of people there.

The front host was very friendly and accommodating and our waiter was super nice. Came to check up on us every now and then. Parking I have to say is the worst since it is on Melrose so you have to find street parking and I got lucky and found one just around the corner but most of the times you might have to park a bit further and walk which is not too bad. I say that it's so worth it. The price for brunch or lunch is a bit on the pricier side. I paid 20 dollars total with tip and everything and for me personally that's on the high side for brunch. The place is also not too big so that's another reason why there's always usually a wait when you go there for breakfast/brunch/lunch. The tables were tiny too but obviously it was big enough to fit our plates and since it's always crowded there, it's really loud.

I will even go so far as to hand craft the award from gold, drool, and sugar as sweet as the kind their french toast held. As you all know, Sunday was Mother's Day and as you all should know, mother deserves only the very best. The vibe I got from Mom was that she wanted something delicious yet casual, a place where you can relax over some eggs benedict and finally have conversation with your children that runs longer than \"gotta go mom, don't wait up!\"Blu Jam doesn't take reservations and we had to wait for a good 20 minutes this Sunday late morning. My little brother growled and snarled at me from hunger like a full on werewolf as we read the large menu posted outside the cafe and stalked around with the 15 other hungry patrons. Thankfully the hostess was gracious and would update me on how much longer we would have to be in this zombie stage. \u00a0But once we were in, the gray skies cleared and we were all smiles. First of all, the decor itself is evocatively delicious. The rust-orange color of the walls brings to the hungry mind an image of a juicy blood orange, a perfect mindset right before you dive head first into the menu. What to order, what to order....Me:- A double cappucino: whole milk, lots of foam, rich and smooth flavor in a big white cup. Love. - Crunchy French Toast: One of the top 3 best french toasts I've had, yes ma'am! 4 pieces of thick textured toast, with moist-but-not-soggy insides, crunchy corn flakes fried into the bottom, vanilla bean syrup mixed in, with strawberries on top and a hint of mint. It could have had more strawberries, but I just love my strawberries and my thirst is rarely quenched. Little bro:- Steak and eggs: Medium rare steak cooked to perfection, covered in runny eggs, caramelized onions, and melted gruyere cheese. Comes with a side of roasted potatoes. Mike came in thinking he was going to order multiple plates but he could barely keep from falling over after finishing this thick slab of protein and carbs. Of course I helped ease the pain by eating some :)Mommy:- Chicken schnitzel with a side of mashed potatoes. Oh mom. You're so Ukrainian still. Mashed potatoes at 11:30am? But yes, they were made from scratch, so creamy and lush. I don't like shnitzel or chicken much personally, but mommy dearest greatly enjoyed her order. Papa:- Norwegian Benedict: Ultra flavorful smoked Norwegian salmon atop poached eggs with some spinach and a side of roasted potatoes. Pops had no complaints. AND get this:As Blue Jam's courtesy to Mother's Day, the waitress brought out the the zestiest lemon crepes for my mommy . My heart melted and my taste buds went for a wild ride at the same time. Has that ever happened to you? It's so wonderfully confusing. So not only is the food everything you can ask for on a breakfast, brunch, or lunch plate, but the service is equally superb. Our waitress was so down to Earth, patient, and friendly. I noticed Czech owner and chef, Kamil Majer, walking around the cafe greeting people and I waved him over to our table to personally thank him for the meal. He put his hand on my back and was so gracious thanking me. What a sweetheart! He has that Old World charm and personable-ness I swoon over when I see in chefs and restaurant proprietors. Le sigh.

On a lovely Friday late morning, a bunch of us 'lifestyle' workers headed here for a catch up. I had heard so much about the French toast here that I was determined to have it, quickly approaching swimsuit season be damned. I was all set to have the stuffed french toast with blackberry jam and yogurt, when lo and behold what did I see? The place was having a French week, with special items on the menu including a CORN FLAKE CRUSTED french toast! Sacre bleu! I hemmed and hawed between the two delicious sounding french toasts until the waitress came and suggested that I get both in one. So, that's right ladies and gentlemen, that means a stuffed corn flake crusted french toast with syrup and vanilla sauce on the side. I just died. And it really lived up to all of the raving reviews! the brioche was fluffy and yummy, the stuffing not too heavy or sweet, the jam just heavenly, the corn flakes giving it a nice savory crunchy touch. I didn't really touch the vanilla sauce or syrup because I thought that would have made it too sweet, but I appreciated the fact that they were there should I choose to indulge. The other girls had a variety of savory dishes, including this asparagus leek truffle gnocchi thing that was super different tasting - in a really good way. I also had two cups of a really strong and delicious coffee that unfortunately for the rest of the day made me feel like Jesse Spano in that one famous episode of Saved By The Bell.

It was a little chilly to sit on their sidewalk patio full of umbrellas but the vibe inside was homey with a red brick wall behind the counter that faced a row of local artistry hanging across a vibrant orange backdrop. There were occasional mirrors and indoor plants to give the place a personality, and the large posting but hard to see Czech menu only furthered our intrigue. We each ordered something to share and I was impressed upon receiving my cup of Wake Up Call ($2.95) which consisted a mix of espresso and coffee that arrived pitch black with no amount of soy that could help to lighten its color and taste. It's the best coffee I've had so far in LA but too bad it didn't come with a round of refill or two. The Blu Jam Benedict ($10.95) came with perfectly poached eggs gently laid on top of tender savory black forest ham and thick slices of crispy bacon over toasted croissant that was adorned with sweet golden hollandaise sauce. The plate was presented beautifully with a cup of fresh fruit with the croissant perfectly toasted to couple with a mix of runny yolk and hollandaise sauce. The meat combination became too salty after a while, and a few slices of fresh avocado could have helped the cause. The Florentine Benedict ($10.95) was lighter tasting with hollandaise covering two poached eggs that were served with fresh spinach, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, brie cheese with toasted English muffin at the bottom. The taste was sweeter than the other Benedict and a dish I would recommend to those who don't want a lot of meat in the morning. Our only Czech dish on the table, Dabelska Omeleta (11.95) had a mix of ground beef, bacon, onions, roasted red bell peppers, spicy red paprika and mozzarella sandwiched between a three egg omelets that came in a crepe-like shape. The eggs were cooked evenly and the fillings were robust and generous.Finally, we shared a Brioche French Toast (10.95) which was impressively decked out with lots of fresh fruit with peaches cooked on the outer layer but still stiff at the center to mix with thick slices of bananas that tasted wonderfully with orange caramel sauce. The plate was glistening with wow factor and it is a dish that I highly recommend.Service was straight to the point but lukewarm and distanced. There were times when our dishes were pushed onto our already crowded table to make room which is not the most pleasant in the morning.

It's over-priced, the wait is a joke, and frankly, their food is as ordinary as it gets. Plain and simple. However, today we had one of the WORST EXPERIENCES in food service/hospitality history, and I'm more than happy to tell you all about it. Blu Jam is located in the heart of Hollywood, where there are probably 100+ productions ranging from movies to TV shows of all shapes and sizes. We usually submit an order for 13-14 people on a daily basis to places all over Hollywood. Everyone is happy to accommodate, especially when they learn what TV show we are calling from. I won't namedrop, but sucks to be you, Blu Jam. To be honest, nobody has ever treated us as poorly as Blu Jam Cafe did today. We sent in our order via fax, which we have done as per usual. We were told \"Sorry we don't accept orders for over 10 people.\" Crock of shit. We order from there weekly. What happened was that today they were understaffed and tried to put the onus on us. Sorry we wanted to give you our business. We won't be so stupid as to make that mistake in the future. We split the order in two to accommodate them. When we called the woman on the phone gave us major shit. \"You're not too clever are you?\" Meaning she thought she was a genius for figuring out that we split the order in two. We weren't exactly hiding it. We did it to be helpful. Everybody needs to eat. We just put the cast members names on a different order and sent it in. No biggie.HERE'S WHERE IT GETS GOOD. We sent our Writers' PA to pick up lunch, as we do on a daily basis. Our Writers' PA is the kindest soul on the planet, and shouldn't be treated so negatively. He takes a lot of shit from studio execs, divas, etc. I draw the line at letting him take shit from some dickbag manager with a Napoleon complex. The owner/manager/fascist that was running the joint today was a complete and total asshole. He screamed at our Writers' PA in front of the other patrons, added an enormous gratuity for \"inconveniencing him,\" and generally acted like the biggest dickhead on the planet. If there's an award for assholery, this guy deserves it. Here's one thing you should know: you don't fuck with a room full of writers. It's our pleasure to take our talents online. Having said that, here are 5 other places just like Blu Jam, but much tastier, cheaper, and friendlier (in no particular order):1. Cafe 101 on Franklin and Gower. Delicious breakfasts, lunch, and dinners. The wait staff is great. Probably never yelled at a customer in their lives. For $11 you can get 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 pieces of bacon, and hash browns. YUM! 2. Fred 62 on Vermont: a true L.A. establishment. Go for the brunch, stay for the hilarious t-shirts the wait staff wears. They're open late for post bar-hopping eats, too! 3. LuLu's on Beverly/Detroit. So much better than Blu Jam. Best omelette around town. We actually go here all the time so we don't have to wait in line with the assholes in Ed Hardy shirts over at Blu Jam on Saturday mornings. 4. Alcove on Hillhurst: A little pricey, but definitely worth it. Great drinks, great food, great atmosphere. This place shits on Blu Jam so hard it's a sick joke.5. The Griddle: Yep, there's going to be a long line on the weekends, but their food is worth the wait. Put your name down and take a stroll down Sunset. You won't be disappointed. All in all, I'd say it's been anything but a pleasure doing business with you. And to the asshole/dickbag manager: don't bother writing me an apology with a coupon on Yelp. Nobody \u00a0that works on our lot will be going within a five mile radius of your establishment. Enjoy your miserable life!! *PS: You also forgot one of our soups, geniuses.

'perhaps you are used to the one from the can?!'ok, Mr. Condescension, i DO very much know what a good hollandaise is, and i've had countless good hollandaisey dishes over the years at some fine effin' establishments--and I guess they are all from the CAN?!?--methinks NOT.HE SAID:'I don't have a chive hollandaise on the menu either?!?'I SAY NOW:--Wait an effin' minute-- I didn't make this up, Mr. Kamil Majer.I got this chive hollandaise idea from YOU YOURSELF!!!I suggest a) Take a look at your printed menu in the restaurant and you'll see it in black and whiteb) Go online to your OWN WEBSITE, blujamcafe.com, and you'll see that you've clearly identified it there as well.For your convenience, I've cut and pasted it here:Florentine BenedictPoached eggs on an English Muffin with saut\u00e9ed spinach, fresh thyme, mushrooms,brie cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and chive-hollandaise, served with potatoes 9.95c) Just a little FYI while we're on the topic of online menus and PRICING. \u00a0Many of your prices clearly haven't been updated in some time. The said 'Florentine Benedict' I had is listed as $9.95 on your online menu, when it's now $10.95. More glaringly disparate on the pricing is the 'Norwegian Benedict' I'd intended to order instead but forgot--It's $12.95 on your restaurant menu but THREE DOLLARS cheaper on your online menu at $9.95, and it's called the 'Gourmet Benedict' on your site. Time for a little updatey!2) LA PROVENCE SALAD AND PINE NUT NUTTERIESI SAID: 'Toss some of my fave goodies in a sea of mixed greens-- sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, 'fire-roasted' red bell peppers, goat cheese and pine nuts with balsamic vinaigrette, and whaddya get?D.O.A.--DRY ON ARRIVAL. :O( \u00a0everything, i mean, yea, sun-drieds are, well...dry. but dried out goat cheese? contracting shrinkage of greens and reds in me salad?

Hmmmm. I wonder where I got some hallucinatory idea there were supposed to be PINE NUTS in this here Provence salad.Once again, Mr. Majer, please make sure to re-check your printed restaurant menu AND your online menu, which clearly states it in boldface type, and I cut and paste once again:La ProvenceOrganic mixed greens, sun-dried tomatoes, artichokehearts, fire-roasted red bell peppers, goat cheese andpine nuts with our balsamic vinaigrette 11.95Ok, I've pretty much said all there is to say, Mr. Majer.Good luck with your business....And please remember to get all the facts BEFORE you attack.This has not been fun, but it's something I needed to have said andDONE.", "Date": "2009-09-28", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "judy w.", "ReviewID": "J-gm37ciYVX-4ni2qbci7Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not sure why this place gets rave reviews. We arrived in the afternoon and the place was pretty empty. I had studied the menu quite fervently the night before and was very much looking forward to the \"Blu Toast\" - french toast stuffed with cream cheese and blueberry jam topped with bananas. I fracking LOVE anything and all that is blueberry so this was something I had to try. I don't eat out as much as I used to, so this was definitely a treat for me. And with so many great reviews I was very much looking forward to it!After we ordered, I was sitting there sipping and enjoying my organic coffee with free refills. Coffee was good. Then I remembered that the water was supposed to be infused with mint and lemon. I excitedly took a sip and was disappointed when all I tasted was pretty much tap water infused with chlorine - no mint or lemon detected at all. Which we felt was odd since we sat right next to pitchers of the mint/lemon water that had visible mint and lemon wedges in them. Bleh.Our food took a while to arrive and it wasn't even busy. At all. There may have been at most 3 - 4 other tables. I dug into my french toast and once again was disappointed. I had better blueberry jam in my fridge than what was used here! And it was not jam but jelly. There is a difference dangit. My side of bacon was all right. In fact, pretty flimsy and not at all crisp. But it IS bacon, so it was inhaled regardless.My meal was not bad and still edible. But honestly I could make a better breakfast! Three out of four of us felt the same. Jenn's Tex Mex tofu scramble was bland and Caroline's Olympus eggs were good, but not great. Lovey adored her meal though. I think it was the Roma Via Paris. I must mention that service, although sluggish at times, was friendly and I didn't have to ask for refills of my coffee once because I was offered them each time.The damage: \u00a0French toast $8.95Side of bacon $2.95Organic endless cup of coffee $1.95OUCH.

As noted by Kamil Majer (owner of Blue Jam) in his comment on my review, Blue Jam is going to stop offering their tapas menu on Wednesday, June 6th and is going to start offering their phenomenal cafe / brunch menu all day, from 8 AM to 9 PM instead. ______BLUE JAM IS OPEN FOR DINNER. I feel like more people need to not only know that, but also to *remember* that when it's dinner time! The reviews for BJC's dinner are overwhelmingly positive on yelp and yet, the restaurant was only half full when I came here to eat dinner last week. And that's definitely sayin something given Blue Jam's crazy line out the door during brunch. Blue Jam is also going to start serving their AMAAAAZING and super popular french toast at dinnertime starting in June so hopefully that will start drawing in the crowds!For dinner, BJC serves \"medium\" sized plates. So note that that's in relation to other places that might serve small plates. For two people, it's recommended that they order around 4 dishes. V and I ordered 5 but I could have stopped at 4 haha :). The menu has like 20 dishes to choose from so V and I took fooreeverr deciding on what to order. But! Never fear. I asked our waiter what were some of their most popular dishes and he was quite helpful.We had (in order from most to least favorite):Herb Crusted Lamb ($15) - omgoodness this was so, so good. The lamb is lightly breaded in a crispy savory crust and the inside is extremely tender and juicy. Perfectly cooked! It's also topped with a mint pesto - some more of that pesto would have been deeply appreciated :). It's also served with a veggie medley which consisted of brussel sprouts, peas, and currants. Beef Goulash ($12) - generous pieces of melt in your mouth beef smothered in a beer and red wine paprika gravy and topped with spatzel. This was quite good. V was eating the beef so daintily. I was wolfing this down haha. I looove this warm and hearty dish. If it had just a taaad bit more sweetness from the tomatoes (I assumed that there was tomatoes in the sauce?), it'd be perfect!Shrimp Ceviche BItes ($9) - shrimp, lime, salsa on a corn tortilla chip, topped with aioli. Very refreshing. Wonderful lime flavor and the texture of the plump shrimp was great. I thought the aioli was a little bit overpowering with the rest of the delicate flavors though. Still, I really enjoyed this and would recommend it. Cauliflower and Gorgonzola Soup for Two ($12) - pureed cauliflower soup with a warm cumin spice, topped with crumbled gorgonzola. The soup was good! I was commenting to V about how relaxed I felt when I was eating this. So warm and fulfilling. Pretty good and the portion was very generous for two people. Barramundi ($13) - seabass in a tarragon chili broth, served with the same veggie medley that accompanied the lamb. Even though seabass is my favorite type of fish, I think this dish was the least memorable out of the rest of the dishes. I also thought the broth was way too salty for me. Oh well.

We both ordered the eggs benedict with potatoes and expected something amazing (especially since there were 3 different options!). The potatoes were very greasy and the seasoning felt off - I've never met a potato I didn't like until now.2. The hollandaise sauce was very sweet and lemony. Definitely not what you would expect for a savory egg dish. I'm not sure if there are different styles of hollandaise and maybe a few people really like the sweeter taste, but for us, it was unappetizing.3. The eggs were almost hardboiled and not runny. Sad, especially for eggs benedict.4. I ordered a vanilla latte as a last ditch effort to taste something good, and it was overly sweet with a very watery/coffee taste. I drink coffee everyday from a variety of places, so I am used to everything from budget to Urth Caffe.

I did feel a little bit Blu after leaving.Cafe? Yes, but where was the coffee? The food came before the coffee and I was dying for a cup!Met my Dad here after a silly miscommunication between us. He was waiting for me in the Canters parking lot. Once we got it straight, he arrived before me and got a space out front using his handicap placard. Me, well crap, Melrose Ave has become so bourgeoisie they charge you to park at a meter on SUNDAY.Things started well as we were greeted by the model runway host who I swear could have been Miss Norway. But once seated we became invisible. I must say though that once the food was served we were treated very well. Coffee and water refills were plentiful, we were asked how we were doing, and at the end told to just relax and stay as long as we wanted.I appreciated that muchly, but the residue from the initial lack of attention stuck with me. It reminded me how wait-staff really MUST be mostly actors because they can employ that \"invisible wall\" technique between themselves and the audience (or customer) so well when they need to.The food looked beautiful. My Dad's Panini sandwich was a work of art. The bread a perfect brown, veggies poking out the sides of the bread tempting one to take a bite. My \"Salmon Cake Benny\" was a symphony in color, balance, and shape. I substituted home potatoes for the micro greens, the rest being poached eggs over home-made salmon cakes. The eggs were perfectly poached, however the salmon cakes were far too salty and the whole thing was only luke-warm. Although the potatoes were sprinkled with rosemary, there were just too many stems, and they were more of an adornment. They may not have actually been cooked with the potatoes which were strictly average, chopped and fried up potatoes.The prices? Ouch. Had everything tasted as good as it looked, that Ouch might be a Yum, but oh well.As far as ambience, the place is enjoyable. Upscale, dark woods, brick, well dressed tattooed and mohawked wait-staff, lots of smiles, but lots of stress too due to the extreme jamming of tables for two up the middle isle.

Breakdown: tofu scramble - kinda blah, for all the ingredients thrown in (bell pepper, black beans, cilantro, 'cado) it was seriously lacking some seasoning. thankfully, a bottle of tapatio gave it some life.potatoes were delish, pretty close to the perfection i've had at Figtree Cafe. you get only one piece of toast cut in half, its a big piece but i'm a hungry hippo and used to two slices of bread. : x \u00a0I was looking forward to the infused water and it was such a bummer to get tap water. :( \u00a0i'm bitter i admit it.

Blu Jam Cafe does a good job of balancing that fine line. Located in the trendy part of Melrose, at least trendy once upon a time, it full of hipsters, wanna-be hipsters and never-will be hipsters. There also seems to be a steady flow of C list celebrities whose faces are vaguely familiar but don't seem to warrant much actual attention, so the Midwest tourists flocking the boulevard will be in reality tv heaven here. And there is a line, always a line. The house Benedict is traditionally good here, most eggs are just eggs so it's all in the poaching which they've got pitch perfect here, and the sauce which has a time tested flavor to it. The roasted potatoes are slightly off kilter with a hint of ginger. If there were just the benedicts, this would be a pretty solid breakfast stop, but the French Toast puts this place right over the top into somewhere quite special. Crunchy French Toast is a remarkable combination of brioche French Toast and corn flakes fried on the outside. It's not entirely original, Marstons in Pasadena has had this dish for years, but it's not nearly as successful there. It's also incredibly sweet, more dessert-like than anything, so if that's not your thing you should probably stay far away. Judging by the number of orders coming out of the kitchen, it seems it's by far the most popular dish on the menu, and with good reason. It's quite easily one of the best French Toast in the city, anywhere.There are many other options to choose from, but there's really no reason to wander from these two options. There's some nice but limited outdoor seating in front, and and a cozy interior thats bathed in a warm and inviting orange. Though it's quite busy, the staff is overall organized, quick and friendly and the food comes quickly. The menu is pretty extensive, there's something for most everyone and prices are standard for this type of place.One bite of their French Toast will make hanging out with Pookie, or Snookie or whoevers about at the moment, not only bearable but entirely memorable.Best Plates: Blu Cafe Benedict, Cruncy French ToastPalate: MainstreamFood - AAmbience - BService - A-Value - B+", "Date": "2012-02-01", "Author_Location": "South Pasadena, CA"}, {"Author": "Seung Eun C.", "ReviewID": "cEcMhb_0kc8QmdKfEL2Ikw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My husband wanted to cry =***(His breakfast arrived on a huge plate.

I don't recall if we chose Blu Jam because they had a burger or if something else from the menu oddly called out to me. Regardless, once there the double egg topped burger cried out to me in such a way that I had no hope of saying no.Once the burger arrived, I realized I had been duped. The old bait and switch, it was a Monet, beautiful from afar but once you get your face right up to the meat of it, it loses its appeal. yelp.com/biz_photos/ki5S\u2026The picture doesn't do justice to the impossible mound of discarded, unfertilized chicken remnants and ground up cow. The thing was a behemoth. Too tall to bite properly and with the TWO fried eggs on top, I knew I'd need beach towel to clean myself up afterwards. Yeah yeah, but how was the flavor? Meh. With that much protein, you need a good helping of salt and then a little more after that. This ex-animal meal lacked seasoning in a big way. The players were all there though, the bun was nice, the burger cooked to a nice medium-rare, the bacon was thick and crisp, and both eggs had beautifully runny yolks. I wasn't the biggest fan of the thick slice of cooked tomato, as it stole too much of the show. Making a reasonable breakfast/brunch burger is harder than it would seem apparently. My advice to Blu Jam; 1) you don't need two eggs, that's just silly, 2) don't cook the tomato or use a much thinner slice, I want to taste burger not salad, and most importantly 3) salt is your best friend, don't be afraid to give the meat a good dousing of it, and no the bacon doesn't provide enough for the entire burger.

We noticed a sign in the window boasting \"Winner of best breakfast in Los Angeles\". With that and the 4 Star Yelp rating we decided to make this our brunch spot. We walk in and we were warmly greeted and recieved by the owner who chatted us up a bit. I like it when someone is personable with you. Makes you feel like you have known them forever. The decor is rustic. It reminded me of some cafes in Bellingham WA. Dark warm interior. With a brick wall bold reds! Loved it! We were taken to our seats and were introduced to Jason our waiter. Super rad guy with tons of charm! We overlooked the menu and while we were looking we were brought out some of there fresh baked bread and homemade olive tapenade. This is the best tapenade that I have ever had. Not overly oily and has a slight kick of spice to it. (we were told that they had chili pepper flakes). The two dishes that caught our eye was the El Fuego and the Migas. The owner came over and asked us if we liked spicy food.. YES! He then suggested the Migas. (I had the Migas) Scrambled eggs, chorizo, cheese, veggies and jalapenos. He also suggested that we try the fruit cup. Now, usually the fruit cups that I have had in the past suck. You know, melon wedges pineapple but he (the owner) told me that they have the BEST fruit cup! UMMMM, when our plates came out I went straight for the fruit cup. Fresh blueberries, figs, sliced apples, grapes.. They don't skimp out on the good stuff you know. There was plenty of tasty fruit. Nothing boring. In fact it was refreshing and I will be back in specific for the fruit cup. Maybe they can make me a bowl!! Anyhoot. Service was amazing. The bus boys to the other waiters were really friendly. The portions are insanely large! I couldn't finish mine. It could also be due to the fact that I kept on eating that olive tapenade and bread. Prices are reasonable. Not, over priced! Unfortunately, they do not have their liquor license yet. Jason told us that they have been trying to get their liquor license now for 3 years. Originally when the owner bought the establishment it came with a beer/wine licence.. But, the city revoked it due to annoying neighbor's who felt that a restaurant which closes by 4 most of the week and by 10 on Friday's offering beer/wine would yield drunks stumbling out of Blu Jam Cafe. Retarded!! Blu Jam will be returning to City Hall to try to get their license again. Forgot the date but if you are a fan you should phone up find out the date and support these guys! Because brunch kinda sucks sans the Mimosa's or Tinto de Verano!! Jason your rad.. Owner/Chief (forgot your name).. Thank you for sending out those AMAZING crepes to our table!

When deciding between here and another place, we decided to do BOTH (ambitious, we know). Came here first at around 11am after a crazy night of fun and were STARVING. The wait was 90 minutes (to be expected for weekend bronche) and the other's was only 15 so we headed there first. We ate ourselves to death, still up in the air about whether or not we should still do a second bronche/lonche here. Decided at around 1 that we should do it (probably only 30 minutes after we finished bronche #1). Please take this into consideration before reading the rest of my review.THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD HERE. JASON MRAZ, ONEREPUBLIC, COLDPLAY...perfect for BRONCHE!!!!!! It seriously was great song after great song. We mentioned it a few times during our meal. \u00a0Got here at 1:30ish, the wait for two was 30 minutes (though it seemed much longer). We were still full from an earlier bronche so decided to order on the lighter side and got the salmon hash and the burrata and strawberries. Also ordered a pot of white tip jasmine to help with digestion.The tea was lovely, my friend drank it hot and I had it iced. Reminded me of my childhood.The burrata and strawberries was plated beautifully. It was fresh with nice color. The burrata was pillowy and the balsamic glazed looked like it could be chocolate syrup. I was extremely excited to try this because I love the mildness of burrata and love the sweetness of balasmic. First bite was interesting. It was not what I expected and the buttered crostini ruined the flavor of the whole bite. Took a second bite and still felt the same way.Moved onto the salmon hash and it was pretty good, though I probably could've appreciated it more on an emptier stomach. Hash was served with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Savory and delicious and didn't need the hollandaise. There were capers (which I usually can't stomach) and they weren't overpowering in flavor. WIN!After trying the salmon hash, we gave the burrata and strawberries another shot. I suggested maybe it just didn't go well with jasmine tea. It definitely tasted different the second time but still not a fan.Staff was friendly. Loved the feel and ambiance of the place.

I probably would have never tried this place but for literally passing by. It's hard to get to from the westside, parking is difficult, and the wait is usually long. We were seated at a 4 fer table. The mimosas were strong albeit pricey. My crunchy french toast was plated on a long and narrow dish that was too small for its host. I probably lost an entire toast to the table by the end. The cornflakes were certainly novel, but lacked a certain...homegrown goodness you find in french toast. I would hardly say it was very much \"dipped in batter\" or \"grilled to perfection.\" I'd much rather have mine truly dunked to thoroughly crunchy extremes than be given a flaky one. Sliced strawberries and blackberries were fresh. I most loved the vanilla bean sauce on the side. Also tried their hangover scramble. If I really had a hangover, it would be a most disappointing antidote. It's described as a \"spicy combination of eggs, jalape\u00f1os, ground Angus beef, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and cheddar, topped with salsa fresca and sour cream, served with potatoes and corn tortillas.\" \u00a0It ended up being very bland and lacking any spiceness - or spice for that matter - whatsoever.

The shrimp was perfectly paired with the chipotle aioli and the crispy salted cracker was the right finish to it. Seared Ahi Tuna: OMG. THIS WAS MY FAVORITE! Not only was the tuna so well cooked and had a zesty lemon flavor to it, but the \"fake\" paella just added to the already amazing flavor! It had a sort of tomato flavor, and it just worked. The reason why its \"fake\" is because paella is usually rice, but instead they used risotto. Please order this!!

The place was already pretty packed.From all those pictures posted on Yelp, I really wanted one of those infamous lattes. I don't recall which one the waitress recommended me but it was pretty good n darn sweet. I was hoping the coffee artist would come up with a crazy design for me but I think he/she kept it simple. It was still a great piece of artwork though.Eggs Bohemia - eggs pan-fried with smoked bacon, black forest ham and chives, served w/ crispy red potatoes and toast ($9.95). It's one of em dishes you'd love to have once in a while. One too many will put you over the hill. The bacon and black forest ham makes it a bit salty but that's what the eggs, toast, and potatoes are there for to counter it.Norwegian Benedict - toasted croissant, Norwegian smoked salmon, poached eggs, saut\u00e9ed spinach, grilled tomato and dill hollandaise, served with potatoes ($13.95). If you don't mind that distinct taste of salmon, then you'll be okay. However, if you're sensitive to it then I'd advise you to stay away. It really is prominent in this dish. My tablemates (two of them) who ordered this seemed just \"aiight\" with it.Brioche French Toast - served with syrup & powdered sugar with fresh berries and bananas ($9.95). \u00a0Awesome, awesome taste and most importantly, texture. Not too soggy, not over cooked. Crispy on the outside and warm n fluffy on the inside just like you. It's a great dish to share.The other dish I didn't get to sample was the Brunch Burger found where else? The seperate brunch menu of course. Since I didn't try it, I can't say anything about it except that it's a darn huge burger especially for brunch. A true American wakes up and orders a big a$$ burger to kick start the day. All in all, Blu Jam Cafe defines what LA dining is all about. From the whole environment to the presentation of the food (which is thumbs up). Unlike many people out here in Hollywood, this restaurant isn't as pretentious and backs up the image is presents with the tasty dishes it pumps out.Arrive early to avoid the wait.", "Date": "2010-11-18", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Julie F.", "ReviewID": "IaSqu6vj6VIY6IwhMT--OQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't let the long line of people hanging out outside discourage you...This place is TOTALLY worth the long wait!!I'm not normally a breakfast or brunch person, but this place won me over and made me a fan!!I shared the crunchy French toast with the cornflake topping, strawberries, and blueberries along with \"Kamil's Breakfast\" which had mac and cheese mixed with scrambled eggs, ham, and bacon. \u00a0I LOVED the combination of sweet and savory flavors!! \u00a0The dishes came out very attractive and the wait staff was friendly, polite, \u00a0and helpful.I highly recommend this place and want to go back!!", "Date": "2012-04-22", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Mimi C.", "ReviewID": "923d0gavY58jvg89PekyJw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great little place for weekend brunch!

As long as you aren't monitoring your calories then you should be quite delighted with this dish! The ingredients says it all! The hollandaise sauce was doable but it was a bit sour to my liking, other than that everything else was Great! The potatoes were shockingly Delicious!.. They were just unevenly cut potatoes without any real support from onions/peppers.. These were Awesome!! Deep potato flavor, soft but held together and I just savored every bite.. YUMM,YUMM,YUMM!!!Crunchy French Toast: Only served on the weekends and holidays, Besides that French Toast is one of my favs, so this was a no brainer! They used the Brioche bread, corn flakes for the crunch and grill it. Then they top it with fresh banana slices and berries served with a vanilla bean sauce. The flakes weren't teeth shattering crunchy like I've had at other places, the mush from the bread was just right (a couple \"brioche\" frenchies i've had at other places were spongy = not good) and the sweetness and batter flavoring were quite Impressive! The berries, indeed tasted fresh and the vanilla sauce just rich, creamy and divine.. One of the better 'Gourmet' type French Toasts I've ever had.Vanilla Latte: I'm not a big coffee, latte, espresso person. I was feeling a little drowsy so I went for it and I'm glad I did! Slightly bitter and had a nice roasty and slightly sweet smoothness to it. Maybe if felt like I napped for 15 minutes after downing this?..

I thought it would be very heavy, but it was actually quite light and delicious. The crunch really makes this unique. I'm not exactly sure whats in the dipping sauce, but it was the perfect amount of sweet. The toppings of strawberries and blueberries made the french toast just the right amount of fresh and sweet breakfast perfection. It was definitely worth the wait. Just the right portion to share!

She normally isn't a fan of egg benedicts so that is a good sign.-Migas-If you are fan of egg, cheese, veggies, all mashed into one, then you would love this dish. Incredibility cheesy and savory. Right amount of veggies to egg proportion. Served with 4 corn tortillas, i would recommend this to counter the sweetness of the french toast if you were to share.

(Ha! That rhymed) Anyways, the place is a real pain to get to since it's in the heart of Melrose but it was sure worth it.When we entered, we were instantly greeted by a waitress who sat us down on some wooden seats and a VERY wobbly table. Ain't nothing like to packets of sugar can't fixed... so problem solved. The place had a Euro Jazz feel to it, even the customers there were fashionably appealing. Obscene paintings were on the wall, lights were dim, everyone was seated next to each other, and the featured colors were dark and soothing. After examining the menu, which was plentiful in variety and suitable for any craving, I decided to stray away from my sweet, pancakey or french toasty wanting side and get something savory for once. I was really wanting the Blu Jam Benedict but since half of these Yelpers got it, I settled for the Salmon Hash. Mama Bear ironically got the Blu Jam Benedict knowing that her son loves Benedicts (aww) so everyone wins!While we were waiting, our very friendly, attentive waitress let us try a Wild Mushroom and Potato Soup since my mother was craving something hot on this cold day. It had a meaty taste from the mushroom and starchy taste from the potato, but it gave you an aftertaste of Mung Bean Stew (which is one of my favorites!) It was delicious but the high temperature affinity taste buds of our tongues were perceiving it as a cold soup... Trust me, to a regular human being it would be steaming hot. Since that didn't suffice our need for heat, she ordered a hot chocolate and I ordered a soy latte as we waited for our entrees.Her hot chocolate was oversatisfying. Not too sweet and not too chocolatey. As for my soy latte, it had the real kick of an espresso with a slight touch of soy in the end. Plus it was a lactose friendly beverage so works for me! Kudos for the latte art as well.When we got our entrees, I (silently) applauded the presentation of my dish. Salmon Hash: Moist, sauteed potatoes with peas, olives, and tomatoes. The majority of the salmon was in between the potatoes and 2 perfectly poached eggs. It came with rosemary toast which had a distinct wheat flavor in it and I had my dill hollandaise on the side. Every single component of this dish could be tasted, especially the tomatoes. It had more a distinct flavor than the olives. The potatoes were seasoned perfectly, a little soggy though, and these poached eggs were amazing. None of the yolks solidified one bit and it made the slightly overcooked salmon have loads more of flavor. The dill hollandaise was just a cherry on top but I swear, the yolk alone will complete the dish. I mentioned about playing with puzzle pieces in the beginning because my salmon hash artwork was ruined by the little kid in me.Blu Jam Benedict: This benedict was one of a kind. In replace of the traditional english muffin, there was a sliced croissant on the bottom. On top of that, 2 different types of pork cuts: ham, then bacon. And on top of that, 2 pillow textured poached eggs, drizzled with hollandaise. It was sooo sinfully good. The sweetness of the croissant complimented the smokey flavorful of the bacon and the saltiness of the ham. The eggs provided that gooey texture from the whites and fat from the yolk and hollandaise topped it all off. I kid you not, you can taste everything! I especially envied my mom's side of potatoes. Unlike mine, hers wasn't moist and soggy. The potatoes had a cotton candy texture, literally melt in your mouth, but the skin was delectably crispy. An interesting texture combination with the same seasoned flavor. I guess it was the veggies in mine that made my potatoes moist.After 4 hours from eating that good meal, I'm still pretty stuffed. Plus my mother didn't finish her benny so I finished it... It was a great experience coming from the \"Best Breakfast Joint in LA\". For 40 bucks, I gotta say it was slightly unworth it, but 1/4 of the 40 bucks were coming from the drinks alone. So entrees of 10-15 bucks, yes it's worth it.

Tentative staff that makes you feel welcomed. They are great at giving advice on what to order. Or if you wanna just chitchat, always have something clever/funny to say. Only drawback is the parking. It is Hollywood, finding good parking maybe turn into quite a bit of a walk. There is always the valet service if you are feelin ballin'. But there are residential areas nearby.

Really nice modern and contemporary pieces up. \u00a0Our hostess and waiter were super duper nice and friendly. And to top off our visit, our order literally came 2 minutes after we ordered it!

Their Benedict was OK. not that great. They skimped out on their sauce...However! Their Crunchy French Toast! OMG. Now this was hella good. French toast wtih some type of frosted flakes mixed and on the top. (With fresh fruit and berries on the side too) This was just amazing.

We waited no longer than 2 minutes to be seated, and the waitstaff was quick in asking us for drinks and our order. The food also came out to us more quickly than I would have expected, which was a pleasant surprise. Throughout the meal, our drinks were refilled in a timely manner and we were asked frequently how everything was and if we needed anything. The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed, and I liked that (it seemed that) the employees weren't restricted by a rigid dress code. They dressed in their personal style - the majority of which fit in with the ambiance of the Melrose Blvd location - and had small aprons identifying them as employees. It was a nice touch for a chill morning brunch.I ordered the Russian scramble, the likes of which I had not seen on a menu elsewhere. It had lox, which other places do serve, but the ingredient combination was unique and delicious. Topped with sour cream and caviar, I was in heaven.

I love the ambiance; it's adorable. We were sat immediately. I got a hot chocolate and a breakfast quesadilla. The hot chocolate was delicious -- thick and chocolatey, but not overly sweet. The quesadilla, on the other hand, was a huge disappointment. It came with egg, spinach, tomato, avocado, salsa, and literally 5 tiny pieces of chicken, which was definitely not what I expected based on the menu description. The abundance of spinach made everything else soggy and unappetizing, and the salsa was waaaay too heavy on the cilantro/onion. The potatoes on the side were well cooked, though, even if they were slightly underseasoned. I tried my friend's turkey benedict and loved it -- it was a mound of turkey, stuffing, and various other Thanksgiving ingredients with the typical poached eggs on top.We shared the french toast with blackberry jam, vanilla yogurt, and mixed berries afterwards. It was good, but not as good as I was hoping based on the reviews. The french toast was a little dry and flat, and I'm not sure the blackberry jam worked with its cinnamonyness (okay, not a word, but hopefully it gets the point across).Service was so-so -- our server was friendly and sweet, but she wasn't as attentive as she could've been.I haven't written this place off yet, but I'll definitely try some of the other great brunch places in LA before I go back.", "Date": "2010-11-26", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Lizee A.", "ReviewID": "nrH_iAW98E1hKAw8F6nXWA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The hubby and I decided to have brunch at the infamous BluJam Cafe.

I followed the recommendation and was glad I did so. The integrity of the bread itself was not lost with all the extra ingredients, but rather it was enhanced. It was more like two slices sandwiched together, with the spread of yogurt and jam in between. The slices are thick enough that you can get a real sense for the superb quality of the bread. Portions are not too large either. I can imagine the plain fresh toast is outstanding, but I am glad I tried this version.

And among the most excellent of Angelino cafes, Blu Jam is a prince. I have developed a guiding principle that if I walk in a store or restaurant where the employees seem to detest working there, it is probably indicative of the establishment in general. And the reverse is equally true. Every time I have set foot in Blu Jam (even on their insanely busy weekend brunch shifts) I have been astounded by how much the employees seem to be enjoying themselves, how unpretentious and absolutely attentive they have been. For your review-consumption pleasure, I have pieced together this list praising the elements of Blu Jam which I most love.1. Tom: \u00a0Tom is a daily regular who greeted my wife and I upon our first feasting at BluJam. If you have any question as to the beauty and goodness of this cafe, just head in one morning and meet Tom (his table is last on the right before reaching the corner table). Blu Jam is a cafe worth coming to every morning of your life. \u00a02. Eggs Benedict: \u00a0This dish is my litmus test for how legitimate a breakfast place is. I have never eaten better eggs benedict than Blu Jam's. It is a work of modern art on a warmed plate. 3. Cappuccino: One does not typically attend breakfast places for the coffee, nor does one head to a coffee place for the breakfast. However, the several cappuccinos I have partaken of at Blu Jam are of the best quality I have enjoyed in LA outside of Intelligentsia or La Mill. 4. Migas: A Mexican-inspired egg dish that seriously amounts to the absolute best tasting eggs I have ever ingested in my life. These are miraculous, life-altering, put-some-spice-in-your-pants eggs. 5. Kamil: The Czech-born owner has been in the cafe on every occasion we have eaten here except during his month-long vacation. Kamil is present, caring, and has crafted not only the menu but the entire culture surrounding it with love and care. I aspire in time to be Kamil's friend. 6. The Bistro: a veritable plethora of tapas inspired European plates are served up on Friday nights. Excepting our wine, four of us shared eight plates for under $100. The beef goulash, baby-back ribs, and tuna tartar were highlights. As always the service was breathtaking--we found ourselves staying nearly an hour past close with the staff laughing and, as my hero, Shel Silverstein wrote, spinning flax-golden tales. 7. The Entire Experience: Blu Jam provides that which few establishments with its marked success can manage--an environment where quality could scarcely get higher and both food and ambiance are crafted with care and delight. On weekends this small cafe serves around seven hundred people between the hours of eight and five, yet those throngs of eaters keep coming back and are know the end is well worth the wait.", "Date": "2010-10-26", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Kari F.", "ReviewID": "4haFy60FkOXiy62UE2orlw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My boyfriend and I were of the lucky people who were able to get a completely free dinner. \u00a0I've never been to this place for breakfast, so my dinner there was my first visit.Why I gave this place 5 stars:1) food was incredibly tasty. \u00a0I tried three different dishes and ALL were absolutely amazing.2) food presentation was beautiful3) the wait staff was awesome, we had Jason as our waiter and he was IMPRESSIVE! \u00a0the boyfriend wasn't sure which beer he wanted, and Jason was a pro at recommending a specific. \u00a0He was also really friendly and straight out awesome.4) the decor is pretty cute, they have some funky art on the walls.5) great wine selection although we didn't have wineWhat we Tasted:- Grilled wild salmon, tomato-olive caper sauce, lemon risotto (BEST SALMON I'VE EVER HAD)- Beets, micro greens, black currants, grapes, gorgonzola, candied walnuts, balsamic (NICE AND LIGHT DISH)- Seared Ahi Tuna, lemon gremolatta, \"fake paella\" (THE MOST MEMORABLE DISH FOR ME, WON'T DISAPPOINT)- Beef goulash, pan roasted gnocchis, beer \"gravy' (BF SAYS: VERY FLAVORFUL, TASTED LIKE THERE WAS A HINT OF HUNGARIAN PAPRIKA.

The latte is served a bit on the hotter side but not too the point that it's burning my tongue. They use whole milk so let them know if you want an alternative. Not necessary my favorite but the latte art is different from other places.Environment: casual cafe setting with jazz music in the background. Outdoor seating also available. The interior has artwork available for purchase. There is also a small alcove for a more romantic environment. There is limited seating (around 40) so I wouldn't recommend parties larger than 4. I can see why them consider themselves a \"cafe by day, bistro by night.\" At night is probably when all the wine popping begins.Service: great. My waitress, Lauren, checked in with me every once and a while and always had a smile on her face. Seemed like she really enjoyed working there. I definitely felt like an important customer. She also asked to make sure I was done with my dish before taking it away.Side notes: Apparently if you come often enough you can get a table reserved for you. There's a Tom's Table and a Regulars Table. I was sitting next to \"Tom\" but I have no idea who he is.

It's unique that their water is served with a hint of mint due to the mint leaves.

I suggest trying to get to the restaurant earlier in morning if you don't want to wait so long. Service is nothing spectacular, it's really all about the food. I highly recommend: 1. The crunchy French toast if you come on the weekend. They coat the toast in corn flakes to get the crunch, which seems strange, but tastes great. Instead of just two big triangles of toast, this dish comes with 6-8 smaller triangles, so there's a bigger crunchy to soft ratio. 2. Kamil's breakfast - macaroni with scrambled eggs, bacon, cheddar, chives, and garlic. This is one of the best savory brunch items I've ever had at a brunch restaurant. It's perfect with the french toast.We also ordered the Roma via Paris, which I really liked (I like scrambles in general), but I wouldn't put it on my \"must\" list just because it's more typical. I ordered the goat cheese on the side because my friend doesn't like it. This actually ended up being a really good decision for me too, because they gave me a ton of goat cheese so that I could have some with every bite.

Seriously, I could eat this every day until I doubled in weight. Ordered the Blu Jam benedict- perfectly poached eggs on top of ham & bacon, on top of a perfect english muffin.. With the best hollandaise sauce ever. Blu jam just does the proportioning RIGHT. Not too heavy on the hollandaise, which is perfectly creamy/tangy, and ugh, the saltiness of the ham/bacon against the creaminess of the egg, next to the chewiness of the muffin? Perfection.Crunchy french toast - not your traditional french toast, but still very delectable. I think the best part of this was the vanilla bean sauce. I wouldn't mind taking a bath in that sauce, seriously. Warm and perfectly vanilla-ed out.

I would eat that salsa all day long if I could.Now to the entrees. You can't go wrong with the scallop or the bouillabaisse. But my favorites are the duck and argentine steaks.

We felt so welcomed there like no other restaurant I've been to. With a review like this, you might think I'm a shill or get something for writing reviews. There are complaints but its relatively minor. Food wise the seared ahi tuna didn't carry as much flavor as the other dishes. It is a bit dark and hard to read the menu or see the food.

The hollandaise sauce is better than any other one I've ever had. The potatoes that come with it are also really good. It's an amazing and hearty meal to say the least. The Crunchy French Toast is literally why I will always go back here. It's not like regular french toast. I'm not sure what they do but I do know they crust the entire piece of bread in what looks like sweet corn flakes and possibly fry it to perfection. It is the BEST thing I've ever had for breakfast. I'm usually not a big fan of french toast and go for the pancakes, but this french toast has no words to describe how amazing it is. The sad part is, you can eat it on its own it's so good, but they serve it with this BOMB vanilla bean sauce that is to DIE FOR! These two in combination are lethal...I can't even string words together to describe how amazing it is. The vanilla latte is the also really good. They do designs in the lattes (sometimes, not all of the time) but the coffee is good just on it's own, no need to add anything to it.

I LOVE the trendy little breakfast joints sprinkled up and down streets like Melrose, boasting a laid-back ambiance and loyal crowd of enthusiastic followers.I hate that I had to wait for an hour and a half to experience it.I won't take that out on Blu Jam, though. I did show up with a party of seven on a Saturday at 10 am. The hostess was endlessly gracious and kept me updated the entire time we were waiting...and a large portion of our wait time was due to the overindulgence of the party holding onto our table. Apparently they stayed late to get their post-breakfast booze on.Anyway, if you can manage to come early with a big group and avoid the crowd, it's an absolute treat. The table for big parties is curtained off in the back of the place, so it's like your own private room. Oh and then there was the fooooood. I'm rarely wowed by an omelet, but trust me when I say that I was wowed. I chose to build my own, with egg whites, turkey sausage, spinach, tomato, and gorgonzola. I'm not even sure what was IN that turkey sausage but it was fantastic. The spinach and tomato were fresh, the egg whites were light and perfectly cooked, and the gorgonzola...well how can you go wrong? Also, this place doesn't skimp on your side of fruit; no honeydew/cantaloupe mix here, we've got fresh strawberries, kiwi, grapes, blueberries, banana slices, apple slices, and pineapple. DAMN. I did sneak a couple bites of the others' herbed potatoes, and they were rather tasty as well.Sad that I've discovered this place after moving away from LA, but I will make a point to be back.

Some people have seen it while driving by. Others have \u00a0had friends tell them about it or have eaten there themselves. What I am trying to say is that word of Blu Jam Cafe gets around.So I had to give it a try. We got there at around 2 pm on a Sunday and, more or less surprisingly, the server told us that the wait would be about thirty minutes. We didn't fight all the chaos of street parking in LA for nothing, so we stood outside and waited. Fortunately, many people started to finish up and we were seated in about ten minutes.There is a lot to choose from in the menu, but don't be fooled. My recommendation: get something breakfasty, something along the lines of french toast or eggs benedict. The only reason you would flip to the lunch menu is for their appetizers and some soup. Otherwise, ignore the sandwiches. However, my acquaintances chose to ignore me, saying that eating breakfast in the afternoon is \"absurd\" and decided to get a half sandwich and a cup of soup combination... but they did not know what kind of soup to get.Our waiter, quirky and goofy but charming, offered to bring samples of the Potato Leek, Split Pea, and Kamil's goulash in order to help them decide. What fantastic service! So after trying the three soups, my acquaintances ordered \u00a0LA BLT and turkey with Kamil's goulash and split pea soup, respectively. I decided to get the Florentine eggs benedict with a cup of chai latte. We ordered the shrimp ceviche to split.The shrimp ceviche consists of three large corn chips and freshly chopped red onion, mango, cilantro, and shrimp. Delicious! Citrusy and refreshing, I could have eaten ten more of these loaded chips.My chai latte came next. Unfortunately, I had forgotten to request a drawing in my latte, so I was a little disappointed at first, but once I took a sip, all my troubles melted away. Hands down, the best chai latte I've ever had. Need I say more?Last but not least, my Florentine eggs benedict. The eggs were cooked just so that they were firm but luxuriously runny. The feta cheese, almost-melty spinach, and roasted tomatoes added that Greek-Italian fusion that I've never had but secretly always wanted in my eggs benedict. Not to mention, the herb potatoes were the bomb.Blu Jam Cafe is definitely not the cheapest place to have breakfast, but it is possibly one of the best places to have breakfast in LA. The crowd is young and hip, the ambiance is intimate but classic, and the food speaks for itself.

The poached egg was nice and runny and the hollandaise sauce was good. One downside was the muffin was a bit soggy by the time I got to it...Overall, the food was just ok... very typical of brunch cafe places.

Thanks Chef Kamil!Then comes the Tuna Tartar sitting atop the avocado and daikon radish, with ginger wasabi vinaigrette and crispy corn tortilla. Just the right combination of Tuna and \u00a0avocado to please the taste. My husband decided to try the Jumbo Scallops with lemon-parsley sauce in cauliflower puree and asparagus. (Let's just say, we ordered a second one.) \u00a0These large scallops were seared properly on both sides with a clean and light taste unlike those drenched with creams. \u00a0It was not salty at all, but did have that complex flavor. I decided on the cheese platter. Not a huge fan of Blue cheese, but this one had a better musky undertone that pairs well with the green apple. The combination that stood out the most was the brie, nuts (walnuts?) and the slices of grapes. This somehow reminded me of the creaminess that I like from condensed milk. (But I'd prefer brie, nuts and grapes over condensed milk anytime from here on.) \u00a0This is probably when the food elevated me already, I was just enjoying every sense that the taste can give. So then there's more, the Gnocchi. Oh you gnocchi, why are you so naughty and fluffy on my first bite? Why do you make me imagine a fluffy pillow so soft and gooey? That bite was so good, I can't imagine eating another store bought gnocchi ever, ever again.The only thing that I was disappointed with was the Risotto.

Well it's pretty darn good. I know that I have too many questions, but seriously... I had tears of joy after my first bite of this flawlessly textured meat cooked to a perfect touch. \u00a0It can be chewed easily and because of that, it makes it possible to enjoy the real layers where the heart of the flavor comes from. \u00a0 Sigh, is dessert even worth mentioning?

It only took 30 minutes from Torrance. Parking at a meter was not a problem and the place wasn't empty, but it wasn't crowded when we got there at 10:30. We were seated right away. There's plenty of indoor seating and some seats outside, although definitely not as many as Toast. Monday - Friday any breakfast is $7.95, but today didn't count since it was a holiday. No big deal since most things were right around the $10 range. Mom got a cup of coffee, I ordered a mocha and both were brought right away. Mom wanted the traditional bfast with two eggs, pancakes and they let us sub ham (you normally get a choice of bacon or sausage, neither of which she likes), and that was $8.50. I got the breakfast that's at the bottom of the bfast menu that came with two eggs, choice of bacon or sausage (bacon of course, duh) and for the French toast, they let me sub the Blu Toast which comes with berries, blueberry jam and cream cheese ($10.00). I got about half a sandwich, cut into two triangles and my bacon was perfect. I don't know if I got a smaller portion because I subbed, and if you get a normal square if you just got the stock French toast. It was the perfect size for me though, and since there was excess cream cheese and blueberry jam goodness everywhere, I gave some to mom for her pancakes. She thought it was really good, which you know, for a Chinese mom is like Simon saying he thinks someone is a good singer. Great experience and food. Will definitely come back to try lunch. The only thing I didn't like was that where I sat (when you enter there's bench seating along the wall and it's parternered up with chairs.

We got seated right away, but had a little trouble deciding what to order. Neither of us had eaten breakfast, but it was also lunch time and the menu had plenty of items to satisfy both. Lately, I've been trying french toast at the breakfast type places, so we decided to share the Vanilla French Toast. As for the second item to share, we ended up going with a recommendation by the waitress, which was the Salmon and Spinach.When the food came, our eyes lit up with the arrival of the french toast. It was calling out to us to eat it first. Plus there weren't any parentals to say no sweets first, hehe. Although you would think a french toast would be really heavy, the one here was pretty refreshing. The french toast was soft and spongy, but not soggy. There was a perfect amount of blackberry jam and vanilla yogurt, and the syrup was served on the side so you could add as much as you liked. But not only was there the fantastic mix of jam and yogurt, there were also fresh blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and bananas. :) This dish was perfect to share because there were 4 sets of toast and plenty of fruit to go around.Then it was time for the Salmon and Spinach. The piece of salmon was a decent size that was enough to be split between 2 people. Again, grilled to perfection with a nice outer layer and a soft, tender inside that almost melted in your mouth. It went really well with the spinach that seemed to be more on the fully sauteed side rather than just wilted, but nonetheless a good pairing. It was also nice to find the little surprises of zucchini, tomatoes, olives and capers in the sauce and mixed with the spinach. Very refreshing as well and not too salty, despite the mix of ingredients.They even gave us a car for a complimentary bottle of wine with dinner for any wednesday to sunday (6-10 pm), so I'll definitely have to try that along with more of their food.", "Date": "2011-05-01", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Perry H.", "ReviewID": "_y55uZAlCAhoCmR2IPqI8Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Did a quick search and found this spot and decided to head over for breakfast. \u00a0We got a seat outside which was really nice. \u00a0It was a Tuesday and there were no folks outside which was a surprise. \u00a0The service was great which can sometimes be an issue when you're one of two tables seated outside.The first thing that threw me was the minty water...I can't say I'm a fan but I'm sure many others will be. \u00a0I took a big swig and placed the mint immediately but thought I was just having a really odd hangover. \u00a0But sure enough, when refill time came the pitcher was full of fresh mint leaves. \u00a0A nice touch and something I'm sure is quite refreshing in the summer.The breakfast was awesome and very very fresh. \u00a0I went with the california omelet which was bacon, tomato, avocado, sour cream & cheddar cheese. \u00a0It was served with (although not needed) with potatoes and toast. \u00a0My entire party was stuffed for the rest of the day and bypassed lunch altogether. \u00a0A great spot for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, and brunch. \u00a0Go!", "Date": "2011-05-17", "Author_Location": "Philadelphia, PA"}, {"Author": "Faryoung B.", "ReviewID": "mKvXaTWQkMKDQurdoQN5_w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new favorite brunch spot!! :)They have valet parking in front unless you're lucky enough to find street parking.The wait for a table of 2 took about 25 minutes but it was well worth it.

The baby was clearly \u00a0very young, and asleep in his stroller. The family was TOLD, not asked to leave the stroller outside, and would be given a high chair for the baby. The mother explained how young her baby was, who still isn't able to sit up on his/her own. The hostess looked at her and said, \"What? He can't sit up on his own?\" \u00a0I was baffled and a bit disturbed. I would have left, had we not have been served at the moment. We were sitting at the tables near the door, so we overheard the entire incident. hostess, you are lucky I didn't here this before I was served. Had I heard this, the rating would have been horrible (and strictly because of her attitude, of course).Aside from this incident, 5 Stars for the food, excellent waiter service, and down-home, neighborhood gem feel. Everything was absolutely delicious and I couldn't have been more pleased with the dishes. Our server was also a doll, taking down my difficult order (and getting it right).I definitely plan on returning, and hope that the hostess is no longer working there. I can see her potentially turning away many customers.", "Date": "2012-04-07", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Lillian C.", "ReviewID": "g9F9WFuGLg71HQB6ogWS9w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What better place to write my 200th review than Blu Jam!

It was a nice sunny day out and I sat in the shade so it was nice! The server and busboy were both very attentive and helpful. I ordered an Arnold Palmer and eggwich. Let me just say, the eggwich is SO BOMB! Super flavorful and the egg was cooked perfectly so that when I bit into it it was nice and oozy. The potatoes were also nicely flavored and salted unlike other places that make potatoes bland. We also ordered a carafe of the white sangria and that was pretty good, but not sure if I'd get it again. Everyone at my table really enjoyed the food and we would come back more often if it wasn't also so \u00a0busy! I think I may even just order the eggwich to go whenever it's too crowded.

I ordered an omelet with spinach, chicken and some veggies, with a salad on the side. Now, I've cooked my fair share of omelets with close to the same ingredients, and if you do it well, it's not going to be watery. My plate was so disgustingly watery that I couldn't eat it. I tried! But it really didn't even taste good. Under seasoned, under cooked. And because the omelet was watery, \u00a0I couldn't have my salad. It was warm and wilted. Talk about bad plating. The manager came over and tried to ease my mind, but she came off as rude and upset that I had sent a dish back. She continuously cut me off when I said anything was undercooked, because my plate was full of water, or juices. And she said \"spinach holds a lot of water.\" But, it really doesn't.

I ordered one of the loose-leaf teas (it was chocolate-infused - can't remember the flavor), and the chai latte amongst my many visits. I have to say that I love the latte art, but neither of the teas were impressive. Quite frankly - Starbucks does tea better. I think the lattes are enjoyable though, but I would say that a coffee connoisseur might say otherwise. I have read many reviews about the questionable service, and I would say that the restaurant is so packed that it is hard to get really good service, but I was never truly offended by the service either.

The Roma Via Paris - scrambled eggs with veggies. The eggs were watery and not appetizing.

Because we had a large group, we were situated in a semi-private room in the back of the restaurant. It was dark, but a whole lot more quiet and intimate than sitting outside. Service was okay. Everybody received their order in a timely manner. No one had to wait impatiently and suffer as the rest of us ate. So that is definitely a super plus. The only problem was that we had to ask the waiter to refill our drinks. Maybe he forgot or maybe its because we were our own room. Who knows.Now the food...Florentine Benedict was to die for. Sun-dried tomatoes, brie cheese, sauteed mushrooms and spinach...what is not to love about it! And the side of potatoes it came in was surprisingly good as well. What a dish! Crunchy French Toast. YUUuuUum. The birthday girl ordered this as a meal, but it was soo sweet it should have been a plate for everyone to share. The French toast is amaze balls. There are so many different textures going on, from the crunchy corn flakes and the fluffy toast. Every bit of it worked well together. The vanilla bean dipping sauce really topped off the dish.All in all, it was a great meal with a great group of friends.", "Date": "2012-06-11", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Angel S.", "ReviewID": "SwctmhJ8YARGCd5KqNt29g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Definitely worth stopping by, especially if you're in the neighborhood shopping as I often am! French toast is absolutely amazing & a huge highlight. It would even be great without syrup! Potatoes are also a must have. Prices are reasonable, definitely a cool & diverse crowd & the waiters are attentive & actually fit right in with crowd dining here. Mind you, it is pretty loud & the tables are in close proximity to one another, so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're trying to get to know someone or feel the need to have a serious conversation...someone from another party is pretty much in your space, though it varies slightly depending on where in the cafe you're sitting. Lastly, the portions here are reasonable, but not overly abundant. Thats great for me because I don't want to head into my day after breakfast or brunch feeling sluggish. On the other hand, I can see how perhaps for a man or anyone not as petite as myself...it may not be as filling portion wise (then again, also depending on what you order).

This place definitely not a good place to go to for brunch if you have a party of 6 or more because it looks like you would need to wait for about 45 min to an hour before you're seated since you're waiting on what looks like the only table big enough for 6. I'm not sure of this logic since when we finally got seated, they could've easily pushed a couple of smaller tables together to accommodate us. With the place not being that big in the first place, I guess I understand since there are usually more groups of 2-4 waiting than bigger parties. A hint for the 2-4 group of people waiting; stay close and don't end up wandering off or else you'll be skipped on and whoever is waiting closer will get your seats before you. Also, be on the lookout for parking around the area and make sure you read all signs as parking is one of the worse in this area. If you end up parking in the residential area, make sure you move your car before the two hour limit or risk getting a ticket. Food wise comparing of all the Brunch places I've gone to, it's not too bad but not sure if I would end up coming back again anytime soon. I ended up ordering their Migas which wasn't too bad as portion was a good sized portion. It was flavorful and I loved the added tortillas and chips. I also enjoyed their known Crunchy French Toast which had blueberries, bananas and strawberry toppings. I understand at some places the added gratuity for a large group which in this case a 18% gratuity added for a party of six or more but I expect the service to be better. Our waiter wasn't around us most of the time and it looked like he cared more about the smaller tables than ours. Also, we had one french toast left on the plate and the employee ended up taking the dishes away without asking us if we wanted the last one.

There appeared to be a wait...but, he looked at the list and peered back into the restaurant and said \"you guys are lucky and came at the right time...come this way!\" (No wait...sweet!) He seated us quickly and the waiter was very nice and on cue. Menus, water vase and 3 cups were brought to our table without asking. We ordered the salmon benedict, migas, and crunchy french toast! Food was delicious...the portion was really big!

It's my favorite meal of the day! It's the MOST important meal of the day. It was Friday, my last day of winter vacation. So, before returning to my workaholic state, I was feeling a bit spontaneous, and decided to give Blu Jam Cafe a try. I was greeted and seated immediately. I understand that this was unusual, since I came here on a weekday and was by myself. I mean being seated immediately, as I hear that there is usually about an hour wait on the weekends. Of course they'll smile and say \"hello\" to you. :)I was given a glass of water and it was infused with cucumber. Oooohhh! As a friend of mine calls it-- \"spa water\". What a refreshing surprise. :)Next, I ordered a cup of coffee. \u00a0I had to stop myself as I caught myself getting all \u00a0Portlandia on my waiter, asking about the source of their coffee and such. But, he happily answered my questions. They use local roasters, Cafe LA. \u00a0I tried to order their French press, but my waiter told me it wasn't available yet. Said that though it was new on the menu, the equipment hadn't come in yet. This was a little confusing. Well, next time. Still, I really enjoyed my regular cup of Joe. It was smooooth in taste and texture...:)This being my first time here, I ordered their signature Crunchy French Toast. And to balance out the sweetness, I ordered a side of bacon.My food came out, and I was pleased that it was a perfectly sized portion, enough to finish in one sitting. Not three! :) I have to say that it was very good. Very flavorful. However, this was not my first time having French toast rolled in corn flakes. I first tried this at Marston's in Pasadena, years ago. This is also their signature dish. However, Blu Jam makes it better. It is softer and easier to chew. Plus, they add different fruit. And of course, it comes with the vanilla bean sauce comes with the French toast. But, I wasn't crazy about the vanilla bean sauce in a small steel cup. The sauce was TOO sweet for me-- too sweet for my taste. It was a little overwhelming for me. But then again, this is coming from a person who doesn't put sugar in her coffee nor uses flavored creamers. I should have asked for some maple syrup or honey instead. If that happened, I would have liked the French toast even more. You however, might love it with the vanilla bean sauce! \u00a0So, to balance out the sweetness of my French toast, I had the bacon. \u00a0They use bacon from Niman Ranch--one of their partner producers. It was pleasantly crispy and nicely cooked, not dripping with grease, nor overly salty. There was a point where I crumbled some pieces of bacon onto my toast. Yum! \u00a0Towards the end, however, my French toast was a little on the dry side. But then again, that's what the vanilla bean sauce was for. Not wanting to waste my food, I used all of the vanilla sauce with my toast. Though not everything is local or organic, as strawberry season is over and bananas are not local, unless they're from my backyard, (Yes, I have a real banana tree), I do applaud Blu Jam for their efforts. As mentioned on their menu and website, \"Blu Jam Caf\u00e9 supports the California economy by sourcing the majority of its food and beverages from local producers, farmers, and distributors.\" \u00a0Hooray! Keep it local, organic, and sustainable--as much as you can! I will be back to try their other dishes, especially as they have many veggie and vegan options. :)", "Date": "2013-01-06", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Hansome K.", "ReviewID": "NIEasuTDkUBKRAEHUambCw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "by far my favorite place to go to for brunch!

I am quite disappointed we don't have some of those restaurants here in the bay. But its okay. it gives me an incentive to go back down to socal. Anyways. We came here for Brunch (there was 6 of us). It wasn't too hard to find parking on the side streets but this is definitely a very busy area and we had to drive to get here. It was about a 30 minute wait which was short considering we had 6 people. So while we waited, we strolled up and down the block and browsed the many shops (well, the girls did. The guys waited outside the restaurant in the off-chance we got a table sooner. we didn't). Once we got out table, we were seated and the waitress was quick to get all of us menus and ask us what we would like to drink. definitely good service.My friends ordered eggs benedict, someone else got a omelete (i think) but I went to for the mac n' cheese plate since I had a pretty interesting adventure the night before [and by that i mean i don't remember a thing but my friends filled me in so it's all good. lol]. I needed some comfort food and so I ordered \"Kamil's Breakfast\" which was Pan-roasted macaroni scrambled with eggs, \u00a0smoked bacon, ham, garlic, chives, and cheddar ($12.95). I mean, c'mon. Macroni, eggs, bacon, and cheddar? how can that NOT be good?and it definitely met my expectations. I was a little worried that it might be a tad bit salty but no. It was perfect. Came on a hot plate, soft macaroni, and no overkill on the cheese. Every bite had a tad bit of bacon, ham and cheese so it was like a perfect bite every time. It was delicious!

The crunchy french toast w/ vanilla sauce is only served on weekends; this is hands down THE BEST FRENCH TOAST I EVER HAD. Yes, it is that good. The french toast wasn't too dense, it had the right amount of crunch, and combined with the vanilla sauce and fruit.. OMG i'm craving it more and more just as i'm writing up this review.

We were around 8-10 of us, so they had us seated separately in private booth.Some of us ordered for fresh juice while others preferred their morning dose of caffeine. And we all loved our drinks. For breakfast, their French toasts and pancakes are the most popular options. And on eating that, we knew exactly why. Some of us called for omelets (I specially feel their California omelet is to die for). They serve most of their dishes with fresh fruits/breads/potatoes. \u00a0They also have loads of healthy options for people who are more calorie-conscious. Let's just say we all had a wholesome meal and nobody was left complaining.All in all, this is on the top of my list for the perfect Sunday morning Breakfast/Brunch.", "Date": "2011-04-11", "Author_Location": "Woodland Hills, CA"}, {"Author": "FOODY L.", "ReviewID": "s_8ccKnI5CbixxbY4WwpkQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ahh - mazing french toast.

But...the seating situation sucks!Their rule is simple: if all of your party is not present when they call your name they will not seat you, no if ands or buts about it.I think the rules needs a lil discretion from the hosts but alas nope.Heres how it all went down...My wife left my name and we patiently waited 30mins-no problem. Table was ready and we immediately said 3rd guest hadn't arrived so we'd continue waiting-no problem. About 20mins later our friend arrived and needed to park her car and after waiting 50 mins I needed to put quarters in the meter-still no problem. When I walked back 1-2 mins later my wife informed me we had been passed up TWICE because I was no longer there and friend had not \"appeared for them to see her.\" I informed them my wife was pregnant our guest was literally walking up and that we very politely gave up a table and played the waiting game without getting upset. Basically they told me \"so that's the policy\". The way all 3 greeters spoke to us was quite rude and without basic compassion. While arguing/talking our guest walked up and it became a mute point, rules were now followed so we were seated... I understand regulations but this was one of those moments were seating us minus the arguing would've have been the right thing to do - the little lady is eating for 2 she needed food pronto! We are great customers and it will be hard not to share out experience with our friends and associates (and you Yelpers). Business looks good at Blu Jam, but not sure we'll come back.

Went here with a couple friends a few weekends ago and if we'd known we were going to wait almost two hours we would have gone somewhere else. I know it's a bummer to tell people it's gonna be that long, but better that than cranky customers. Either way, the staff were really nice and once we got in the food was great. With popularity comes issues like this, though. Hope they expand soon.Thanks for the response Kamil- Best of luck opening your new location! I appreciate you responding to your guests. Again, staff was great and food was tasty. Thanks for including vegan options. I work in a restaurant so I get the issues... \u00a0Perhaps the day that I was there you were understaffed. I know people call in/things happen. It was just a LOOOOOONG time. I dunno how long you've been bustling like that.

You know it'll be a good year when you've crossed out 8 places off your bookmark list within the first month of the year. Blu Jam definitely brought it last weekend when I came here for brunch with my girls. We waited a good 35 minutes but got the chance to shop around Melrose for some good deals. I don't see how you could ever get past the wait since even after we left around 2PM, there was still a line outside. I would recommend adding some standing umbrellas especially on warm sunny days because there is absolutely no shade during the AM, and I could tell people were getting hot and sweaty waiting for a table.I started off with an iced Chai latte, which funnily tasted like iced Horchata. It actually makes perfect sense since both are full of cinnamon and mixed with milk. I suppose I preferred a stronger Chai, but it was refreshing and not cloyingly sweet. I saw on yelp that someone ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict substituting the English muffins with croissants. Genius. I immediately knew that was exactly what I wanted. Even when our waitress said it would be an additional 75 cents to substitute with croissants, I didn't hesitate. Unfortunately, they were all \"out\" of croissants. I suppose we did go later during the day, but I didn't see many other items on the menu with croissants, so I had my doubts. I decided since that basically ruined my desire to get eggs benedict, I would go with the Morning Hash. Good second choice. The hash came in a large portion and had generous amounts of all the toppings: black forest ham, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, onions, red potatoes, and mozzarella. It was delicious and very satisfying. Others in my group got the BBQ chicken sandwich, mushroom salad, and Florentine Benedict, and we all shared an order of the crunchy French toast. The French toast was by far the most interesting thing I ate that day. As their signature dish, the crunchy French toast is rolled in crunchy corn flakes, topped with fresh bananas and berries, and served with a vanilla bean sauce. It wasn't too sweet, and the texture was perfect: moist and fluffy with a crisp from the corn flakes that's not too overwhelming. The vanilla bean sauce was just the cherry on top. Definitely one of my favorite French toasts of all time. I'm sure I will be back here soon because there are so many other items on the menu I would like to try.

Hm, what to do with two hours of spare time? Find somewhere to eat for brunch! We yelped around the area and came across Blu Jam Cafe. It was a restaurant that my friend had wanted to eat at for awhile, so we decided ... why not?! Because it was on a weekday, there wasn't too much of a wait. We found metered parking right in front of Blu Jam and paid for an hour before giving the hostess our names as we waited for a table. They have tables outside, as well as tables inside of the restaurant. I feel like the outside area is a little more cramped as it is basically on an enclosed area of the sidewalk. There is a little tarp that keeps the public from staring at the people who are inside the outside area though. After about a 7 minute wait (menus are posted outside so we were able to look and see what we were interested in), we were seated at a table inside. The hostess and our waiter were both very nice. We were quickly given water before given our menus. I really like that they have a breakfast menu that is served all day, as well as a few specials. Lunch is also served all day. There are also vegan, gluten free and vegan possible dishes that you can order as well. Very helpful that they include that on there! Given my previous situations at brunch places, I decided to go with a savory food choice, despite the wonderful pictures and rave reviews of the crunchy french toast that I saw on Yelp and on other people's tables. I ordered the California omelette: Three egg omelette, crispy smoked bacon, fresh tomato, avocado, sour cream & cheddar cheese, served with potatoes & toast $12.95, replacing the potatoes with greens. My friend ordered Kamil's breakfast: Pan-roasted macaroni scrambled with eggs, smoked bacon, ham, garlic, chives, and cheddar $12.95 after asking the waiter what was popular and what he himself recommended (there were so many choices!). Both her brother and sister ordered the crunchy french toast: Egg brioche dipped in batter, rolled in crunchy corn flakes and grilled to perfection, topped with fresh bananas and berries, served with vanilla bean sauce $12.95. Lastly, my friend's boyfriend ordered the LA Club, I believe: Sliced turkey breast, black forest ham, crispy bacon, avocado, tomato, cucumber, mayo and provolone on toasted ciabatta $13.95 and substituted the potatoes for the mixed greens. Food breakdown: Everything came out fairly quickly. I was really really surprised at how big my dish was. I had an omelette and some bread with jam and butter AND some mixed greens? Dang! It was really good, but really heavy. I couldn't finish the entire thing because of how heavy and filling it was. I feel like the bacon made me incredibly full really fast. I did try a piece of the crunchy french toast. It was really really good, and not too sweet. I think I could have eaten it, but I'm glad I stuck with savory. The vanilla bean sauce was really nice, too. That dish came with lots of fresh fruit sprinkled on top. I was able to try Kamil's breakfast. I remember the waiter telling my friend that that dish would be incredibly filling, but it was a big bowl of eggs. She said she kept wanting some cheese to fill her palate, but there was just a whole lot of egg. I thought it was pretty good, very fluffy and light, but I don't know if I would eat it again. As for the LA Club, her boyfriend said it was very good. The waiters were really busy and always walking in and out, but I felt like they were all incredibly nice and helpful. I saw the juice prices and felt it to be a bit pricey, but then again, everything on the menu was a bit on the pricey side. As wonderful as the meal was, I think something in the omelette gave me a stomachache for the rest of the afternoon.

My food was brought out promptly but without much of a smile.The food was downright awful. I have to mention, I did get my food to-go. But maybe if their food doesn't stay fresh and delicious in a to-go box on a less than 1-mile journey via car down melrose...they shouldn't offer to-go. Suffice to say, I don't think the deliciousness factor of the food was effected by the take out journey, it was flat out boring. I ordered a simple order, and one that I figured was hard to mess up: grilled cheese w/out tomatoes & red potatoes on the side. For one, they put on tomtatoes when I asked for none, but hey, while I feel bad that someone else who enjoys tomato didn't get the ones I was served, I have no bad feelings about picking something off I don't like, and can still enjoy it. This was not the case with the grilled cheese. Besides the bread being soggy and literally almost dripping wet, the cheeses they chose were either cheap or simply not pungent enough to have any real flavor. It was inedible. I didn't even feel right giving it to the dogs. The potatoes were equally soggy, bland, and boring. I don't think there was any seasoning on there at all. I won't be back for another visit.

Being grilled and sweetened only by the topped fruit is a nice step away from the traditionally over syrup-ed and egg slopped toast of grandma's past.

Perhaps it was because I am unaccustomed to Brunch at 2pm or because my friend was on his B positive blood type diet that shuns poultry because it's the only protein with no taboos yet (no not really, you'll have to read this NY Times best seller for more details) or because for once, sugary griddle goodness just didn't sound appetizing. Whatever fueled our indecisiveness, we did finally settle on the following: Loxex with egg whites (sour cream on the side): Warning the smoked salmon is adulterated by heat, so set your heart on COOKED salmon and BIA (Brie missing in action). Overall, a decent egg white scramble. Rosemary toast: Pleasant herb quality that is subtly flavors the bread and compliments the Loxex. Tasty! The Potatoes: So PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THE POTATOES, PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THE POTATOES, can I say this enough times, PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THE POTATOES.. save yourself the disappointment and order the FRUIT! YES THE FRUIT! The charming little fruit bowl with fresh figs (don't like figs, don't know what they are, it's OK they're expensive and worth it), blueberries, strawberries, bananas, not too fresh cantaloupe, watermelon, and honeydew. Did I say it came with FIGS and BLUEBERRIES? OK enough said.

The Goulash-I don't know if you can tell, but clearly I'm not Hungarian and really had no idea what I was ordering, but I do know that it was comforting, rich in flavor, and delicious! A Goulash virgin before this I have no goulash barometer for you. However if you're looking for a thick paprika flavored soup with tender beef, carrots, onions, and potatoes, here you go. The bread was over toasted and just straight up hard and slightly stale, perhaps they were trying to infuse a bit of Eastern Block authenticity to the meal.

I had something that was like mac and cheese but with bacon and egg. Amazing. My cousin had the risotto with pesto and 2 poached eggs. I think that is my favorite. It tasted and smelled so fresh because of the pesto. We also ordered an order of the crispy french toast that he said I had to try. It was very good. Luckily he ordered it for us to share because I could never finish a sweet dish for brunch alone.

No wonder this place was voted the #1 breakfast spot in La........though I didn't order breakfast, haha. Still, not the point. Parking sucks. Period. You're chances are upped if you go up a couple blocks from Melrose and find street parking, then walk to the cafe. It was really crowded, though we did come on a Saturday morning. I think we waited an hour before we were seated. We got a lovely table outside on the edge, so at least we didn't have to uncomfortably sit there and eat while people waiting oogled us. The service was friendly and attentive, but the food was fantastic. I ordered a bowl of the split pea soup and half a gourmet sandwich- you get to choose which kind. I was pretty bummed they wouldn't let you get the soup and sandwich combo with the ahi tuna, but what I ended up with was yummy, so who cares. I got the turkey with avocado, cucumber, and cheese on delicious bread. First of all, the soup- AMAAAAZING. I'm a huge fan of split pea, but it's hard to find a good one that's not too pea-y but not too watered down. This one was perfection, let me tell you. Every spoonful was heaven, and the huge parmesan croutons were a great garnish. The bread was great for sopping up the deliciousness that my spoon just couldn't scrape. How much of a pig do I sound now?When the sandwich came, I was almost disappointed that I was going to have to take my taste buds away from the soupy goodness, but once I bit into the bread, I somehow rose higher than food heaven...if you can imagine that. The bread was perfect, soft inside and crunchy outside. Delicious blend of flavors. I, of course, was full off the soup alone, but I refused to waste the scrumptious sandwich. I somehow managed to shove most of it down, and I was busting out of my dress on my drive home. But do I care?

We decided it was time to get some grub. We were looking for something close, fast, cheap, and healthy. Not too many choices right? Well, luckily we found one; Blu Jam Cafe.We first showed up to Blu Jam around 5:30 and we were told the restaurant is closed between 5 and 6pm to set up for dinner. Grrrr! Fine. We walked down the street and checked out a couple more shops, then finally came back just itching to stuff our faces. We chose a small table on the patio and gave the menu a looksie.Blu Jam is a cafe by day, and a tapas bistro by night. The menu even says that each dinner dish is meant to be shared between two people. Suh-weet! I love tapas restaurants. I love having a bunch of different tastes for each meal rather than having the same taste for twenty or so bites.The dinner menu is pretty small (but usually that means each selection is as great as the next). There are cold plates, hot plates, Mediterranean plates, and sweet plates (dessert) sections. There were two of us, so we decided on four dishes to split. We got the sauteed jumbo scallops (with herb-parsley sauce, asparagus, lemon risotto, and bread crumbs), grilled wild salmon (with tomato-olive caper sauce, and lemon risotto), tuna tartar (with avocado, and black truffle oil-chive vinaigrette), and warm berries (with balsamic sauce, and vanilla ice cream). The scallops were extremely juicy and cooked to perfection. This was actually my first time having scallops, but I instantly fell in love. The salmon was flaky with a firm outside. The tomato-olive caper sauce was an interesting addition that I have never seen with salmon. It was almost like marinara sauce I guess you could say. I don't eat too much Mediterranean food, so maybe it's a normal thing. But either way, it was great. My favorite though was the tuna tartar. Oh. My. God. It may have been the best tuna tartar I've tasted (or maybe tied with BLT Steak).The warm berry dessert was the perfect selection to go with our other dishes. Having such rich entrees (sauces, and other additions) it was nice to have a settling, healthier dish to cap the meal. Of course, I had my eye on the chocolate cake, but my friend talked me out of it. I guess girls know better blah blah blah. But what can I say, she was right.I've heard Blu Jam is mostly known for their breakfast and/or brunch. I think next time I come here I'll do it before hitting the flea market down the street.

The smoked salmon eggs benedict with sauteed spinach on a croissant was the unanimous favorite. It's such a luxurious dish that it always takes first place. I love breaking the runny yolks all over for a creamy treat. Next up: Migas, a superb excuse to have nachos for breakfast. It's a mix of scrambled eggs, cheese, jalapenos, peppers, chorizo, salsa and tortilla chips. Sides include potatoes and a flour tortilla. I had only had cafeteria grade Migas previously. This is way better. We finished with strawberry, banana, and Ghirardelli dark chocolate pancakes. There was just the right amount of chocolate for a hint of sweetness however I thought there could have been a bit more strawberries.I actually think the food is 4 stars, but the service is so pleasant that I gotta round up a full star.

We got there around 10:30 AM, and the line was pretty long, but we didn't have to wait for a long time. We actually had to wait for a while to get our food, though. Anyway, my friend ordered plain coffee and egg benedict, and I ordered white peach tea and French toast with berries and blackberry jam (they have 3 or 4 different types of French toasts, and it was very exciting to choose from them! The waitress was super nice and made friendly recommendations to me when I was indecisive). I was actually getting a little bit impatient because it took them a long time to serve our food. But mmmMMmmmm! With a sip of white peach tea, I forgot about my impatience. It was just PERFECT--not too bitter, not too sweet, and very VERY soothing and calm. Yes, it's weird to use those words to describe the taste, but trust me--that was the best peach tea I have ever had. But of course, if you prefer sweet drinks, then you shouldn't get it since it's not sweetened, at all. Meanwhile, my friend was pleased with her coffee since she was smiling as she held her cup with two hands and enjoyed the smell of her coffee.When our food was finally served, we could not take our eyes off from our plates. My French toast had nice decorations with mint (I believe it was mint), fresh berries rolling around the toast, and not-too-much powder sugar. I fell in love with it when I had my first bite--God, it just had to be the best French toast I've ever had in my life. The berries were VERY fresh, and the toast was not too soggy, either. It was sweet because of the blackberry jam and powder sugar, but it wasn't too sweet. It was just RIGHT. I LOVED IT!My friend's egg benedict was a success, too! She really loved it. If you are looking for good amount of food as your brunch/breakfast, then this is it for you! The only thing I didn't like about it was that the egg was too runny for me. I always cook my eggs well-done, so I didn't like egg benedict as much as French toast. So if you don't like runny eggs, then you should get something else, such as French toast!Overall, I really enjoyed my brunch at Blu Jam Cafe. Yeah, you have to be patient because they don't serve you right away. My friend and I had to wait a while to actually get extra plates we requested.

Yes, the wait on weekends averages about an hour, but you're on Melrose so go shopping while you wait (lucky for me, I can walk home and hang out for an hour). I have had maybe five or six things on the brunch menu. I suggest starting with a shrimp ceviche, which I know might not sound appealing for breakfast, but it is one of the most refreshing, flavorful dishes I've ever had. The Eggwich is unreal, with soft, fresh ciabatta bread, pesto aioli, greens and delicous eggs and bacon. You cannot oversell their eggs bene since it is redonk (props to HIMYM fans). Get either dishes with potatoes, which are deliciously crispy and cooked with rosemary. Their crunchy french toast (and make sure to get the crunchy french toast rather than the regular) also lives up to the hype.After coming and being blown away a few times for brunch, we finally tried it for dinner and were once again blown away. Alex, our waiter, now knows us as regulars and greets us asking, \"The usual?\" which is a downtown brown to start. He is full of great recommendations and is, without exaggeration, the best waiter that has ever served me. The dishes are meant to be shared, which I love because it allows me to try a few different items. Once again, the shrimp ceviche is amazing. I also love the chicken tingas, the brussel sprouts, and last time we went there was a salmon special with a black bean risotto that Kamil (the awesome and friendly head chef and owner) said was going to be added to the menu soon. His soups, whether it is cream of spinach or shrimp and lobster bisque, are some of the most flavorful creations and I savor every single bite. The nice thing (for customers) is that the dinner here hasn't caught fire yet, since they haven't been doing it long, there is never a wait--but I expect that to change soon. They are also doing a five course meal the first Tuesday every month that has wine pairing to each dish, which I NEED to try. The only downside is that they are only open for dinner from Wednesday to Saturday. We would have gone there for dinner for my girlfriend's birthday last night, but it was closed.Finally, the service. For brunch, yes, service suffers since they are so crowded, but they still get the job done. For dinner, as I already mentioned Alex is a great waiter and genuinely seems like a cool guy. On our first time here for dinner, Kamil came and gave us a friendly greeting as well as shrimp ceviche on the house. He is always genuinely kind and takes time to come say hi. He also seems like he's had an amazing life. I read he used to be a butler for the Reagan family when Ronald was governor of California. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and he specially, and on the spot, made me a tiramisu that's not on the menu. I had not had a tiramisu that delicious since I was in Italy, and it still topped most that I had there.In short, they have secured our loyalty for a long time.", "Date": "2012-04-17", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Josh P.", "ReviewID": "jdxs3se0Ps5PkHxhlDnO4w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "David was super friendly and kind enough to help me with my groggy headed menu indecisiveness, pointing me toward \"Kamil's Breakfast\" a delicious combination of macaroni and cheese, eggs, ham, garlic chives and cheddar. \u00a0 Everything, \u00a0and I mean everything was good, \u00a0every detail...every flavor. \u00a0The potatoes had just the right crispness, \u00a0the bacon was cooked perfectly. \u00a0David brought a French press to the table, and the coffee from it was so good my non-coffee drinking wife who had just gotten off night shift and needed to go to sleep kept drinking it. \u00a0Go to this place, \u00a0and go often.

Blu Jam definitely changed my mind. Although it is overpriced, I think the flavors and quality of food is worth every penny. There's always a wait on the weekends but I've never waited for more than 15-20 minutes. My favorite is their Salmon Hash with ample salmon, capers, veggies and poached egg. It is a bit pricey at $14 but for worth it for the amount of salmon and large portion (not crazy Griddle Cafe size but enough to share or take half home). I also love their Vanilla French Toast served with vanilla yogurt and fresh fruits. I came here once when they ran out of this french toast but the waitress recommended the lemon crepe with fresh fruits. I'm glad that they didn't have the french toast that day because I would never had tried this interesting and delicious dish. The lemon juice complemented the fresh fruits so well. My only complaint is that it got soggy by the end of the meal but it is definitely worth a try.Their lattes are also delicious. Restaurants, even breakfast eateries, rarely get the soy latte right. The soy was never burnt and the portion of the latte justified the price. I've also tried their teas (white peach, plum oolong, chocolate monkey) and felt it was just a tad too pricey.I wish that they served breakfast during dinner hours as well.

I'm a student at CSUN so i am always in the valley. I live here now. But i decided to visit my parents in LA this afternoon while i ran some errands. About 3:35pm i realized i was in the area, so i decided to call for take out for the signature crunchy french toast. They told me it would be ready in 10 minutes (red flag number one). I know they close at 4pm so I got there 10 minutes to close and no one acknowledged me so i walked up to the cashier. She had very low energy. Paid for my stuff and even left a few dollars tip! I guess i shouldn't have done that because when i got to my bf's house to eat it, the bottom was kind of burnt though it was still edible. And the fruit on top looked like it was also a rush job. There were no bananas. The strawberries were chopped super tiny. I don't really care for the fruit too much but it just goes to show it was a rush job. The presentation was horrible. I was buying it for my best friend to try and i was disappointed. I've been hyping this place up for the last 6 month and even planned to bring my girls here for a nice brunch but i don't want to do that if i'm not certain they will enjoy their experience or if i'm not sure the dish is CONSISTENTLY made the way i'm used to.

I ordered the Old World dish and was really excited that there was, in fact, an actual dish that included mushrooms in an omelet. Most places I go there's a bit of modification that needs to be made to the omelet order so I had really high hopes for this dish. It came out watery....Yeah.For those of us that love mushrooms (and cook with them) you know there's nothing worse than putting that mushroom into any dish and having ALL of the juices from the mushroom come out and completely ruin the rest of your food. From baking pizzas in the oven to sauteing the mushrooms FIRST to get rid of all that excess liquid I really think it's sort of cooking 101. The fact that an accomplished breakfast joint like Blu Jam couldn't nail that was really disappointing. To make matters worse I had less than an hour before I had to be somewhere and couldn't send the dish back. I picked around the drier edges and what I DID consume was decent, the pairing choices of the mozzarella and very fresh chives was great, usually I'm stuck with cheddar or some other cheese. But the mozzarella was a very good choice and I think it actually helped thicken up the eggs in certain areas. Just was over matched by the mushrooms tho (which were also good, a great variety).So, not saying I'm never going to eat here again... but the next meal I grab here better be worth the hype or I'm gonna have to write off Blu Jam-- and such a shame cause it's a great location.", "Date": "2012-08-09", "Author_Location": "Arcadia, CA"}, {"Author": "Derek F.", "ReviewID": "BMqD7rPYfH_VYck8E4SVxQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This place was alright.

Everything I've tried has been delicious. The French toast and berries seems to be my favorite. Although, the raw granola isn't something I'd pass up either. If you're a tea junkie like me then you'll love that they have the best blends from The Art of Tea stocked on their shelves. Their plum Oolong is a gift from tiny infant Jebus. I loved it so much I ordered my own stash for my office to drink when I am unable to be here. I love the music they play in here. I love everything about this place. On the walls they have the most amazing photographs that were taken on a safari. There is one photo that every time I see I actually have to stop myself from spending 350 on it to own a picture of a baby giraffe drinking out of a lake. I am also pretty sure Rian is sick of hearing me say,\"I love that picture I really want to buy it I need to not be broke.\" so that being said If you've never been here I suggest you come. I feel like each of my visits has gotten better than the last.

Hearty Granola with oats, wheat, honey, almonds & fresh fruit w/ milk topped with fresh berries, bananas and black currantsPower House which is four egg whites scrambled with spinach, topped with flame-broiled chicken breast and saut\u00e9ed tomatoes and basiland lastly there is Rian's favorite.... BBQ Chicken Sandwich which is grilled breast of chicken, smoked bacon, caramelized onion, melted provolone, mayo, tomato & BBQ sauceThe fruit and vegetables are always fresh and from local vendors. The service is never less than perfect. The staff is always wide awake and smiling even when I drag Rian out of bed at 8 am on a Saturday to get there before the rush.

\u00a0The girl on the phone said the best time to come would be 8:00- 8:30, because the place starts getting packed at 9:00! \u00a0So I came early, but it was well worth it.I found a great parking spot, easy metered parking, then checked in on Yelp ;) and saw that they were offering 50% off on their sangrias!!!! \u00a0Woohoo!!! \u00a0It is impossible to have a bad day when it starts off with an early-morning breakfast of half-off sangrias, that much I know.We get to the restaurant, and even at 8:45, the outdoor patio is full. \u00a0The inside is nice, cozy and nicely decorated. \u00a0I asked the waitress about the sangrias and she said that she recommends the red, so we started with that; $4.00 instead of $8,00, amazing! \u00a0It was the best sangria I've ever had; I've never been to Spain, but my friend had, and she thought it was a great sangria too.I was happy to see that there were vegan options clearly marked on the menu. \u00a0There weren't very many options, but all of the breakfast and lunch menu items were available at any time of day, which helped (hmm do I want a panini in the morning? \u00a0Possibly, I almost ordered a veggie panini for breakfast). \u00a0Might I suggest offering all or some of your egg scrambles made with tofu, upon request? \u00a0I think a lot of vegan customers would love that. \u00a0I ordered the Spicy Tex Mex Tofu Hash, which is easily one of the tastiest breakfast items I have ever had in my entire life (I think it may be tied for 1st place with one other breakfast I've had, but the ambiance, sangria,and coffee is better here, so this place is better). \u00a0The flavor is amazing, the potatoes are crispy on the outside and perfect, and the corn tortillas that are served with it are so soft and fresh. \u00a0My only (personal) problem is that it was so delicious, and the portion size was so big, that if I didn't have the self-control that I do, I would have eaten it all and made myself sick. \u00a0It was just sooo good, but it's nice to get so much for your money!I also had to order one of their coffees, since I saw on the Yelp photos that they make little designs in them. \u00a0I love when restaurants do that! \u00a0It's such a nice detail! \u00a0It makes me really happy. \u00a0I ordered a soy latte and my coffee came out with \"soy\" written in it in soy, I posted a photo of it. \u00a0Everything here is above and beyond amazing, I just wish that I didn't have to get here so early (okay, I did have a full, productive day because I was forced to wake up early, that was nice). \u00a0I would love if they took reservations. \u00a0I love that they use organic ingredients and have vegan options that are insanely delicious.A+++!!!!", "Date": "2012-08-22", "Author_Location": "Santa Monica, CA"}, {"Author": "evan b.", "ReviewID": "qCazUWvWMJjj7Kap2B_dBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LA is full of great breakfast places, but this is my favorite. \u00a0Everything I've had there is good, but I'll focus on the lox plate. \u00a0It's the best I've ever had. \u00a0They get their salmon smoked by an artisan who's only client is a high end casino in vegas (belagio?

The Tofu Tex Mex Hash is full of flavor and will blow your mind! Let's put it this way, my meat lover bf cant get enough if this vegan dish. It comes with roasted red potatoes, black beans, tofu and pico de gallo. The plate also comes with tortilla for all of you that likes breakfast tacos. :)Now on to the Crunchy French Toast... I'll be honest, I've never really like any type of French toast period. They're always too sweet or too mushy for my liking. However, the ones here are to die for! These are coated with corn flakes and topped with fresh strawberries and bananas. \u00a0I've ordered it every time I'm here and it's each time the French toast came out perfectly! Perfect balance of sweetness and freshness.Finally, the vanilla latte is adorable and delicious!

Sometimes the fruit sides are bleh at restaurants, but I was pleasantly surprised by the fruit... bananas, blueberries, strawberries, etc... yay!*Custom omelette... with chicken apple sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, and smoked bacon. Thought this was whatevs. Not bad, but whatevs. They were generous with the toppings but sometimes I think I prefer a different ratio of egg:topping.*Juices - got a fresh squeezed \"designer\" juice of carrot-orange juice and it was lovely.*Water (I know sorry) - the water had mint in it, just a smidge... and it was nice!

Fast forward an additional 45 minutes later; I am finally seated. Food was excellent. I had two orders of their signature Crunchy French Toast and a single order of a Blu Jam Benedict. Ambiance wise, it's kind of loud and jam-packed inside, but I'm willing to overlook it for the sake of the food. Unfortunately, there's no where for the waiting crowd to sit (which tends to be anywhere from 15-20 people), so I was made to stand in the sun for the 45 sem-odd minutes. My bill totaled to $53 dollars. Their orange is exorbitant and does not come with free refills. The two glasses of orange juice I had brought my bill to $9.90 alone. Overall, a decent experience.

I've eaten at Blu Jam at least once every weekend since first tasting it. I'm in a three dish rotation: the Power House (four egg whites scrambled with spinach, topped with flame-broiled chicken breast and saut\u00e9ed tomatoes and basil), Hearty Granola (oats, wheat, honey, almonds & fresh fruit w/ milk or low fat vanilla yogurt topped with fresh berries, bananas and black currants), and the BBQ Chicken sandwich (grilled breast of chicken, smoked bacon, caramelized onion, melted provolone, mayo, tomato & BBQ sauce - I order mine without the cheese and mayo, in case that matters). The BBQ Chicken sandwich is available at all hours, which is nice because sometimes that's what you're supposed to be eating at 9:00AM on a Sunday. All three are phenomenal. I count myself to be very fortunate that my eating partner will split some of these dishes with me from time to time, allowing me to get a double-dose of deliciousness. I've tasted the pancakes and french toast - both are superb. The fruit is always ripe and the bacon is usually mighty fine.The service is largely communal, and everyone's very friendly and helpful. This place can get pretty crowded, but I still fell adequately attended too. I've taken it upon myself to seek out my own water refills on occasion, but that's mainly due to my own impatience.My biggest knock on this place is that they haven't jumped on the bottomless mimosa craze that I've been enjoying at my other other weekend haunts. They don't serve any alcohol here, but hopefully that is being remedied as I type.Nice jazz music is always playing, which is a great weekend morning ambience. The decor is hardly worth mentioning, but I'm going to anyway because I know a certain someone who enjoys the photos of the big cats and the giraffe looking awkward as hell trying to drink some water.I recommend arriving early to make parking easier (and cheaper, if you arrive very early) and to beat the crowds.

We wanted to try something new so I headed to Yelp to see what I could find. After a bit of research we decided on Blu Jam.I had the Eggs Bohemia. It's two eggs, any style-I opted for over-easy, mixed with smoky bacon, ham and chives. All served with a side of country potatoes and your choice of toast- I chose the Rosemary on the recommendation of our server. The eggs were cooked perfectly to order and it was mixed with a generous amount of bacon and ham. The potatoes were crispy yet soft and the rosemary toast was a nice new flavor! I also ordered a fruit smoothie, you have the option to choose any combination of fruits, I chose strawberry and blueberry. It was quite tasty and a good start to the day!One of my friends chose Kamil's Breakfast and didn't love it. It sounded pretty interesting but she said \"there was something missing\" from the dish. Couldn't pinpoint it exactly (she said it could be cheesier??) but it was just \"something\" that made it feel lacking. Another friend chose the Louisiana hash and while she liked it, she didn't love it. Unfortunately none of us really loved our dishes. And for myself and my friend who had the Louisiana Hash felt like amongst our eggs and such we were eating grass as they completely overloaded the dish with an overly generous amount of chives. Normally chives are sprinkled atop the dish and diced quite small, our dishes were covered in green and the chive pieces were at least a half inch to an inch in length. A bit overwhelming. Also while placing our order we had asked for water to be brought out. We had received our other ordered drinks (latte, tea and smoothie) but never received our water. We then asked for the water and our server never apologized for forgetting it, \u00a0instead we were told by a gentleman (I'm guessing the owner or manager) that they are conserving water and we have to request it. Um...we did, and never got it. it wasn't rude or anything, but we did make the request and it was forgotten. We didn't really feel like a lecture was necessary since it was the server's fault not ours.I realllly wanted to like Blu Jam, especially after reading such positive reviews here. Perhaps it was what we ordered, I'm not sure, unfortunately I don't know that I'll be back. The food wasn't stellar and service was ok, not completely efficient (see water comment above) but friendly.

Eight half-slices of french toast encased in crunchy cereal arrives on a endlessly long, rectangular serving platter. Bananas, sliced strawberries, and blueberries dot the vision and powdered sugar is dusted atop everything. The french toast is wonderful -- moist on the inside, crunchy and buttery on the outside. It pairs very well with the vanilla bean sauce they provide on the side and I loved dipping each bite into the sauce for another kick of subtle sweetness and moisture. I also had some of my friend's Migas Scramble ($11.95) which is described on Blu Jam's menu as a \"spicy combination of eggs scrambled with jalape\u00f1os, chipotle, beef chorizo sausage, bell peppers, tortilla chips and mozzarella, topped with homemade tomato salsa, served with flour tortilla and potatoes.\" It was just spicy enough and was a delightful mouthful of flavor. Portions were hearty and generous. Oh, and I can't forget the amazing fresh-squeezed Orange Juice ($4.50/large) here. it's a bit pricey at $4.50 a glass, but it was so different from any other OJ I've tasted and uniquely sweet -- I think they have magical oranges here. You've just got to try it. Ambiance: (4/5) Came here for brunch at 1:20pm this past Saturday and our party of 2 got seated after a relatively short 12 minute wait. We were seated in the small, umbrella-covered, fenced outside area (~9 wooden tables for 2) , which was pretty fun as there were always interesting characters or things to look at. I usually prefer indoor seating, but sitting outside at Blu Jam is fun, particularly if you enjoy people watching. The mood of the place is laid back, no pretense, hipster, and cool -- i thoroughly enjoyed dining here.Location: (5/5) Blu Jam is located right on Melrose in an area just alive with energy, and activity. There are an over abundance of things to do and see in this immediate area -- shopping galore, salons, etc. \u00a0Parking is, of course, a concern, but its not impossible. There are plenty of spots in the residential areas on either side of Melrose. Granted, most of them are filled, but if you just keep driving a little bit you're bound to find a spot. Just read the signs carefully -- some residential areas allow you limitless parking after certain permit-only hours and some areas only allow 2 hour parking after permit-only hours. Service: (3.5/5) Service was prompt and straightforward. our waiter didn't try to make any unnecessary small talk and didn't actually smile -- ever -- but he was very conscientious about checking in with us every so often and making sure our needs were taken care of. Overall: (4/5) I was very happy with my dining experience here.

Six years ago the brunch craze wasn't a wide spread obsession in LA. The only main options in West Hollywood was the cramped, never wow worthy Griddle Caf\u00e9 yet it did offer French Press coffee back then so that was a cute novelty act that made it appear ahead of it's time yet so did the breakfast burrito at one point. \u00a0If you wanted a more upscale brunch option you'd go to Hugo's but that's more of an upscale tea restaurant for actors, pretty Gung Ho types in wife beaters and old maids like Ed Limato that did an awful job of cleaning up Richard Gere's name after it got smeared. \u00a0These are all reasons for why Blue Jam is the best thing to happen to Melrose place since Heather Locklear hooked up with Richie Sambora and took all of her new video vixen friends shopping for more leather studs \u00a0in the only area in West Hollywood where you can see sexy street traffic that causes traffic jams from behind.

The place has a few quad tables, and about 30 deuces that are moveable to make quads and larger. \u00a0You can probably put in a party of 20 along the big wall by combining tables, so they are very flexible with their seating space. Very smart for a place with a small dining room.I orded the Norwegian Benedict which is smoked salmon, spinich, tomato and poached eggs on top of a croissant. \u00a0It's topped with dill hollandaise sauce. \u00a0It's served with grilled red potato wedges. \u00a0I also ordered one blueberry pancake. \u00a0The coffee is really good.it's like the chef knew what he was doing. \u00a0I got the benedict without the pancake. \u00a0I was able to enjoy the savory portion of the meal before the sweet. \u00a0Maybe it was a mistake for the pancake being late, but it was a good mistake. \u00a0The benedict was okay. \u00a0The salmon didn't have that big of a smokey flavor so the hollandaise and egg yolk overpowered it. \u00a0The croissant added a buttery flavor, but the texture of the croissant is crushed by the toppings, so I would say it's like a soft pie crust instead of a flakey croissant. \u00a0I think a crispy english muffin would give this dish better texture. \u00a0The red potatoes are crispy on the outside, but the wedges are so big, the crispy to soft ratio was very small. \u00a0The only savior for these potatoes were the yolk and hollandaise sauce. \u00a0They do serve a ketchup in a small sauce tin and maybe it's the tin presentation, but I thought the ketchup was homemade. \u00a0I guess you can put a few drops of apple cider vinegar into some Heinz and make it taste gourmet. \u00a0I'm not saying this is what Blu Jam does, but the ketchup tasted good too.The star of the show was the single blueberry pancake that arrived when I was done with the benedict. \u00a0It was perfect timing. \u00a0A crispy edge pancake with blueberrys and powder sugar with real maple syrup. \u00a0Great texture on the outside and soft pillowy on the inside. \u00a0I probably could have forced myself to eat an entire stack of these, but luckily for my belly, I only got 1.", "Date": "2011-09-04", "Author_Location": "Torrance, CA"}, {"Author": "Leigh D.", "ReviewID": "-aSzEolpdH8SvafadGuL4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Delicious, healthy - a must-try if you're in LA.

We noticed this Cafe only by its bright yellow umbrellas out front and I honestly wouldn't have stopped in if it weren't for my friends - I think I have tunnel vision when it comes to Melrose..everything looks about the same to me. I walked in on a Saturday afternoon thinking we'd be in and out pretty fast, but somehow I was sitting at a table 30 seconds later. First impression was alright..the cafe is cutesy and decor was nice and bistro like.There weren't any problems with noisiness or crowds for me; in fact, there were only 2 other tables occupied. Then again that might be due to the fact that it was 4pm and the place closes at 5 on the weekends.The waitress that served us was friendly and attentive, as was the owner. I assume he's the owner as he was calling out instructions and just seemed in charge overall. He was pretty nice, asking us how we were and seeing to our needs.The food. I loveeee food, especially when that food is good and priced in a reasonable range. So when I looked at the menu and saw a breakfast of 2 eggs for $10, I was VERY hesitant to order a lunch entree. Maybe I'm just cheap, maybe I just figure I can make my own eggs at home for 1/10000000th of the price. Anyway, I cautiously turned to the lunch portion and saw combos! That's always a good sign :] My friend and I decided to split a cup of soup and half grourmet sandwich combo: bbq chicken sandwich and turkey chili soup.I don't really have anything special to say about the meal, just that it was pretty good. Up til that point, I'd been munching on the bread and olivey vinegary dip thing that they provide beforehand, so I wasn't super hungry when the sandwich and soup came. Portions and my meal's pricing were average for a little cafe - I paid $12 for a cup of soup and half sandwich (with a little bit of salad to fill the remaining half of the plate).To sum up my visit I'd say go for yummy food if you're in the area, don't if you're more than a few miles away, mostly because parking is a pain and it's out of the way unless you live nearby.", "Date": "2010-01-03", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Sylvia W.", "ReviewID": "rDPPyoSnYvYLe-XkUlhg4g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My favorite brunch spot these days.

For a party of three, we were seated right away. I love breakfast, especially places that serve breakfast all day. I usually prefer to order pancakes, but after reading the reviews about their infamous Crunchy French Toast, I was intrigued. The order came with 3 slices of brioche bread sliced in half, topped with bananas, blueberries, and strawberries with a dusting of powdered sugar. This dish did not disappoint! The corn flakes that coated the toast gave the perfect crunch in every bite and the vanilla cream sauce was so delicious! In addition to my French toast, I ordered a side of chicken apple sausage and a mocha latte, which came with a cute coffee art topping. These additions complimented my meal very well. Our server was also really friendly & attentive to our needs. Everything was great about this place! My only complaint would be the parking.

At that point, I was a little disappointed because my girlfriend had received her tea, but my latte hadn't come yet. \u00a0 As each minute passed, the pain became even more excruciating.. I NEEDED MY DAMN LATTE. \u00a0Once it came, I was in heaven. \u00a0 I fell in love with my Vanilla Latte from the minute I laid eyes on the creative latte art. \u00a0With each little sip, my heart grew fonder of the Blu Jam Cafe.The waiter took several minutes to take our order, but the latte kept me distracted. \u00a0It was just soooo good. \u00a0When the waiter came, I ordered some red potatoes and the Kamil's breakfast. \u00a0The Kamil's breakfast was a unique combination of macaroni, cheese, scrambled eggs, and bacon. \u00a0It came relatively quickly; however, there were no potatoes in sight!!! \u00a0With each bite of my breakfast, I grew even more impatient waiting for my red potatoes. \u00a0I wanted to stand up and flail my arms in each direction, but I still wouldn't have been able to find the waiter. \u00a0After I finally got his attention, \u00a0it still took him 15 minutes to bring me my potatoes. \u00a0At that point, I had already finished most of my meal, and I didn't really even want them anymore. \u00a0 The worst part about it was that he was a little snarky, and he didn't even appear to be apologetic. \u00a0 It was clearly his mistake, and he blamed it on someone else. \u00a0However, I didn't care because I thought the breakfast was \u00a0so damn good. \u00a0I came back several days in a row, and each meal was even better than the last. \u00a0The service was actually better the second and third time around; I think the first time was probably just a fluke.I also learned that the trick to successful ordering here is to be adventurous... step outside your comfort zone. \u00a0It's not like eggs and bacon are going to awe you anywhere you go. \u00a0Give the place a shot for breakfast or brunch and you might even fall in love (with the barista).", "Date": "2010-01-11", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Christine R.", "ReviewID": "zVZ7aQg2D2gwiNMue9dbWw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This the place I love more than any place on Melrose the spa is next door so its really nice.

FOOD POISONING!!! and for some of you guys that may have had it.. It wasn't lovely and might i add that is was the first time that i had it.... So i had the worst ruff two weeks ever.... The only thing that i can say was really good was the Chai tea latte. But other wise then that, I should have known better not to eat from it cause the food came out cold.. and my eggs were slimy... While i was eating the crunchy french toast all i can think bout was how soft they were not crunchy at all... To me it just felt like they had our food sitting for ever and then brought it out... overall i want to thank all the people that gave this restaurant a five star review to get over there to have food poisoning omg... I have nightmares thinking about..... thanks but no thanks never again...so update 5/6/12.. i sent this to him for this reply he sent to me..woah woah woah... don't get you panties all in a bunch...i did say your chai tea latte was great... And nobodies \"excellent\" you temperatures suck... And i didn't dream up a food poisoning it happened.. I have my witnesses that were with me to side with me on that...Im not the only one who said your french toast was soft or your eggs were slimy or your food came out cold. I even copy the name of one of the reviewers who said that, her name is Janine R. And its no point in coming back... ill take it as a loss, don't get sentimental about your family and kids. All i said is it was a horrible experience probably a bad cooking day for the chef.. And to say you have NEVER received complaints from customers.. I'm guessing you can't see all the one star reviews you got. Some even saying the same thing i said( like the eggs were undercooked or the french toast was slimy or your food was room temperature) your food should ALWAYS be hot when you serve it like that chai tea latte you served me...P.s- this was no flu... and when i say my stomach contents (water or food) couldn't stay in my stomach for two weeks you do the math...

Their food is pretty awesome, but I've been there twice and the service is what kills me. I work in a restaurant so I know it can't take THAT long for breakfast food. The first time we went, my friend and I both ordered omelettes with potatoes. It was about 11 am and it wasn't super busy. But it took almost 30 minutes for our food. We kept seeing food come out, yet it was never ours. The server never came over to tell us our food was on its way or anything... FINALLY it came. I had the Burgundy Omelette. It was pretty amazing. The creamy goat cheese was fantastic. So we were able to overlook the service. BUT the second time we went... oh man. So we place our order and wait. I got the Morning Hash and my friend got the California Omelette. So we wait. Knowing that is might take a little while, we settle in and start talking. Then we see all this food coming out, assuming it should be ours. NOPE. A party of 5 came in about 15 minutes after us, and got their food about 20 minutes before us. So finally I get our servers attention and ask her where our food is. I tell her we had been waiting about 45 minutes. She CORRECTED me and said oh well it's only been about 40 minutes. (Excuse me?!) She said apparently the kitchen just never got the ticket but she did put it in. Ok whatever. So then the manager came over and apologized for the wait. He brought us a half order of their famous crunchy french toast. Well, ok. The server informed us that because we did wait so long, they would give us 50% off. 45+ minutes seems absolutely unreasonable that I didn't really want to pay at all. I am not the type of person who is ever looking to get food for free. I have no problem paying good money for great food. But by the time our food came, we were in a hurry to eat so we couldn't really enjoy it.I might be back but it is just for the food because it is a little more interesting than just eggs and bacon.", "Date": "2012-08-09", "Author_Location": "TRABUCO CANYON, CA"}, {"Author": "Hermela N.", "ReviewID": "r2VZgJXUJ0Wp4R2o2g-XIQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazing food and atmosphere!

Under the scorching sun, many people had elected to wait under the awning of the adjoining modest store. We were given a choice of outdoor or indoor seating. We chose indoor, since the outdoor patrons are completely exposed to the waiting crowd, and it felt kind of awkward to eat while 25-30 people are waiting for you to finish. The indoor seating did not turn out better. The place is very crowded, with tables jammed close together and noise level very high. It appears that the owners are milking this establishment to the max. The waiters were hurried and clearly overworked. We waited 15 minutes just to get water. After we got our food, we felt rushed; my wife was only halfway through her meal (I was done, though) when the waiter showed up with the check and asked her whether she wanted a box. The food itself was ok, but I expected better from a place with such good reviews. The potatoes were bland and slightly burned. The eggs Benedict were ok.The most irritating thing at this place, though, was the double standard applied to the customers. While we were waiting to be seated, a big black Mercedes parked in the passenger loading zone in front. The couple (apparently someone important plus wife) was seated immediately.

It was wonderful! Very quiet and relaxed at that hour - not many people out on Melrose, all the shops are closed, and the people were there for the food and the ambience, not the \"scene.\" It looked like there were quite a few regulars. The owner came out and chatted with everyone, even giving his regulars a hug or (in the case of the dog) a scratch behind the ears. It was another of those places where I can't decide what I want - everything looks too good! I ended up with \"Roma via Paris\" - three eggs scrambled with spinach, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and a few other things I don't remember. Definitely not pretty on the plate (all the ingredients turned the eggs a weird brownish-grey) but yummy in my tummy! It came with potatoes or fruit (I had fruit) and choice of toast (I highly recommend the rosemary). My sister had eggs benedict Florentine. Now that was a beautiful dish - we wished we had the camera! She got the potatoes and said they were just \"okay.\" The coffee was wonderful, both the decaf and the full strength. And I love that the water has lemon and mint. How many places do you go where the tap water is memorable? What attention to detail! Speaking of detail, when I finally stopped stuffing my face and had a chance to look around, I noticed all the original artwork lining the walls (it's all for sale), the rough but warm wood paneling, the high unfinished loft ceilings that are all the rage in restaurants right now, and the general charm of the place. It would be fun to come back one night to see the difference when it's more of a \"bistro.\" Just a note to respond to some of the other reviews - it looks like they may have upped the price on the weekday breakfast special - I think it's $6.95 now.

Our waitress was very friendly, another plus because she was very helpful with suggestions and recommendations. The wait for our food to come out wasn't too long, about 15 minutes or so? Now the moment came: I took a bite into my Brioche French Toast--they were absolutely amazing! Probably more-so because I hadn't eaten French toast in ages. I definitely don't remember French toast tasting this good! (Again, probably because I hadn't had them in such a long time, so I may or may not be exaggerating--most likely not!). My French toast was topped with fresh bananas & berries, and a side of syrup--tasty indeed. However, if sweet isn't your thing, the Migas looked very tasty, as well as the Blu Jam Benedict.

It will sooner snow in Los Angeles before you eat. I arrived here Sunday morning at 10am and requested a table for 7 -- the hostess said it will be 45 minutes to an hour. I understand large parties require more time so I was more than happy to wait. As I saw people who came after us with parties of 4 come and go -- at 10:30am I asked the hostess (this girl with a African/British accent -- I think her name was Donna) how much longer, just to get an estimate, she replies \"Well you came in at 10 and I told you 45 minutes to an hour. It's 10:30 right now, so 15 to 30 minutes.\" (I hope my fellow yelpers can understand what a terrible answer this is for someone waiting) I'm not one for confrontation -- and by that I mean I'm not going to give you a bitchy attitude because you determine when I eat -- so I said okay (like it made any sense) and walked away. Later, hoping to get a different answer, my friend asked her at 10:45 and she gave her the same ridiculous answer. At 11 I go in and ask her how much longer and mind you she can't use her previous answers so she goes and checks after some debate and comes back with \"they're nearly done.\" I asked her what does that mean and she said -- BE READY FOR THIS -- \"Well I don't know, how long would it take you to eat.\" (WTF) I'm asking you as a hostess, in your professional opinion and these are the answers you give me? Now I hope you've followed this story long enough to understand that not only am I annoyed with her attitude at this point, but at the vagueness of her answers. I've lived in LA my whole life, I'm not some tourist from the Nascar nation states. I understand that there are 12 million people in this city and when you come with a large party that waiting is almost always mandatory. What I don't understand is someone who works at such a busy restaurant can't give me a better answer. This is your job, no? I understand that it is a really difficult job -- no joke, you have to plan accordingly when large parties come. But what kind of self respecting LA hostess gives this answer? And what kind of attitude is this? She couldn't deal with us so the manager came out and apparently we were waiting for the one large separate table they have in the restaurant while there were empty tables in another area. Now if I have to pay a mandatory 18% gratiuity fee because of the larger party, I expect a little more from a restaurant. You have us waiting for one party, with no back up plan? What kind of restaurant does business like this? When asked if we could get separate tables, the manager told us that it wouldn't be fair to the waiters if we separarted the parties. Now I was really peeved at this point because it wasn't fair for us, the customers, to wait so long while other parties of two/three came and went while we waited. All we would've taken up were two small tables. After waiting for what seemed like forever and a half, we were finally seated. Our waiters name was Jason and he was extremely delightful and that's why they get the star. As for the food, it wasn't worth the wait or the drama. I've waited 3 hours for sushi before, so it's not like I don't know how to wait patiently for food. There are better restaurants out there for mediocre brunch. I really hope for the sake of the restrauant that they get a better hostess, in my experience, this is prbably the worse hostess I've had to deal with.

although i was really looking forward to my meal. our waiter seemed to notice that our food wasn't out (but he never came over) and after a few more minutes he came with our breakfasts. the first issue was my blueberry pancakes were not made with blueberries (they obviously realized the mistake so they threw a few on top). i was hungry and going to let this slide, but when i went to put butter on them they were cold. my husbands food looked amazing except for his potatoes, which were basically raw, unlike how he had requested them which was well done. our waiter never came over even though we requested him and instead the gentleman who had been plying me with coffee came over and we mentioned all this to him. he then promptly took our breakfasts off to be fixed. this is really where it all went wrong. first the waiter never during this whole time came over and second rather than make us new meals they just stuck my husbands eggs as well as my whole meal (minus the blueberries) under the warming lights while they crisped up his potatoes then just brought the food out again (this time no blueberries even on top). obviously this did not fix my issues and his main meal was no longer fresh. again we tried to get the waiters attention and could not, he just seemed to know there was still a problem and avoided our table. by the time we finally did get his attention my husband was halfway through his meal. he said he was sorry that he saw that my stuff was made wrong, but at this point i wasn't going to have them try again. my husband ate while i finished my coffee and water. the bill came and they only took off my meal - seeing as i had nothing to eat and my husbands meal had issues as well i feel they should've comped our entire meal. as we were walking out the manager said \"sorry about your breakfast\", but it was too little too late. bottom line i don't think i'll be headed there any time soon.", "Date": "2009-01-03", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}], "RestaurantInfo": {"RestaurantID": "d5YWKrP-zG74nqOYzHn7Zg", "Name": "Blu Jam Caf\u00e9", "Price": "$$", "RestaurantURL": "/biz/blu-jam-caf%C3%A9-los-angeles-2", "Longitude": " -118.3505853042", "Address": "7371 Melrose AveLos Angeles, CA 90046", "Latitude": " 34.083682067479003", "ImgURL": "//s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jin6R8V68WPqg4nT8DMK1A/90s.jpg"}}
