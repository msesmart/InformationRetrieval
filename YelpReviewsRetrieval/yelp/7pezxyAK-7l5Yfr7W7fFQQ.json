The food is a solid three star. Value for your dollar is a big fat 1 star. Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head because of all the rave reviews and also the long line waiting outside even before the restaurant opened.We got basically most of the popular items.Drunken noodles with sea bass, we asked for level 7 spicy and it had a good kick and the sea bass was very moist and tender with it. However, for almost an $30 dish, it was not very much \u00a0noodles and just barely enough fish for our group of 4 to split.Crispy Duck Kha Soi (Sp?), this was a creamy coconut based sauce with egg noodles and crispy duck. I have to say, the duck was perfectly cooked and delicious, the noodles was good too, especially coated in the sauce. Again for the price of $25 it was barely enough noodles to split between 4 people.The fried shrimp everyone seemed to get. I do love how crispy the shells are, completely edible and full of shrimp flavor. It looks like a big plate of 10+ shrimp, but it's more like actual shrimp meat is 4-5 pieces and the rest of just shell. The spicy chicken wings were just OK, tastes like Costco wings tossed in the Asian sweet chili sauce, would skip next time.We got the red chili dip, it was very smokey but that was about the only flavor it really had, not a fan of this one either.Ordered a curry dish, it didn't have coconut milk and was another one lacking in flavor, didn't finish this dish because it just didn't taste like anything, just a lot of boiled veggies in a red watery soup. You'd think after 6 dishes between 4 people we'd be full but ended up having to order another drunken noodle dish but this one with just veggies. Sadly this second round was not as good as the first one with sea bass. We also go their mango sticky rice for dessert.Overall, some of the dishes were very good but not good enough to justify the price.", "Date": "2014-07-24", "Author_Location": "Irvine, CA"}, {"Author": "boris j.", "ReviewID": "YwIQ-ScF3aJAJRnra5M-Pw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This review is for the SERVICE.

For Thai food in general, it's okay.Despite being off the strip and in a secluded plaza, Lotus of Siam is hyped up by almost any Vegas native/frequenter who recommends Thai food to you. The head chef is a chef who formerly worked at the Wynn, so it's easy to see why people are excited about it. The place is usually packed with people, so reservations might be recommended (although we just walked in and had no problem getting seated).The food itself isn't bad. It's chock full of flavor, but I can't say it's the best Thai food I've ever had considering each dish is in the double digits. (Not unusual for Vegas.) We ordered the Pad Thai and sea bass with drunken noodles with two Thai iced teas; everything was decent, but not worth the money, in my opinion.Lotus of Siam is worth checking out if you're craving some Thai food while in Vegas, but keep your expectations lower if you come from an area that is familiar with Thai food.", "Date": "2014-07-19", "Author_Location": "Newark, CA"}, {"Author": "Cindy C.", "ReviewID": "BI1N-T8_43kFWTm0AhVKzg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was on my list of must-try places in Las Vegas. I think it was a bit over-hyped. Or maybe I just didn't order properly. I've had some amazing Thai food and can't say this was better than anything I've had in the past. Some of the Northern style dishes I can't compare but I don't think they were spectacular based on their own merit. But the celebrity endorsements and accolades on the wall can't be wrong can they? Let me just start by saying that this restaurant is in a totally sketchy neighborhood. There's even a sign in the restaurant that says that you shouldn't leave your luggage in the car. They have luggage storage in the restaurant so you can bring your stuff in with you. The whole strip mall looks like a bombed out war zone and I'll bet it's pretty scary when it's dark. Like zombies-come-out-and-attack scary. It's a nice surprise when you enter the restaurant and see it bustling with, not zombies, but living humans - totally the opposite of the ghost town outside. There does seem to be the illusion that it's busier than it actually is (at least when we walked in). We requested a table for 4. They told us 45 minute wait. We said we'd come back, then they chased us down the parking lot and said 30 minutes, then as we were walking away again, they said they had a table available. When we got in, there seemed to be quite a few open tables. As for the food we did as advised and mostly ordered from the Northern dishes at the back of the menu. \u00a0The Spicy Chicken Wings (regular menu) were delicious. My son said they were the best chicken wings he'd ever had. They were crispy and came in just enough chili sauce so the chicken didn't get soggy.The Seafood Soup (regular menu) was okay. It was pretty spicy. The bowl came with one scallop, two mussels, a prawn and some squid. It was okay but not the best Thai Seafood soup I've had. The Red Chili Dip (ground pork in chili sauce) served with fried pork rinds and veggies was pretty bland. It needed salt or something. Everyone basically ignored it after one taste. The Garlic Prawns were FABULOUS. Crispy prawns, battered, fried with heads, shells, tails and all. Honestly, the best part were the fried shells - they were like potato chips. My hubby thought they could've used a sweet and sour dip and I agree that might have been nice, but I liked them just fine the way they were. The Crispy Duck with Mint Leaves were served on top of noodles in a sauce and topped with some herbs and peppers. Personally, I don't think crispy duck should be served with anything wet (like sauce) because it makes the crispiness go away. I've had some amazing crispy duck and this duck didn't really do anything for me (or my hubby who LOVES crispy duck). Fried Bananas with Coconut Ice Cream for dessert was good. Nothing special. They didn't have the sticky rice with mango available. The bananas were wrapped in wonton wrappers then fried. Nothing wrong with that, but I can also make this at home. All of this and a couple glasses of wine came out to about $132 before tip. The prawns and the duck were both over $20 bucks. Otherwise, everything else was around $8-15. All in all, spicy chicken wings and garlic prawns were good. Everything else: MEH. I might go back and check out the front of menu next time. There are some pretty fine Thai restaurants in the Silicon Valley/Bay Area that I think are MUCH better.", "Date": "2014-07-15", "Author_Location": "Silicon Valley"}, {"Author": "J M.", "ReviewID": "18ulvlaSaWNhrrpvArlGMg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MAKE RESERVATIONS.

Still, it sits in an easily overlooked and unassuming strip mall away from The Strip. The walls are adorned with famous celebrities as former patrons. There's still a wait, although much of that may be to create the illusion of a packed dining room (it's not). We waited about an hour for a table for six, although the table had been empty the entire time. The menu itself is huge and includes dishes from Northern Thailand not found in your average Thai restaurant. Based on prior reviews, we ordered the nam kao tod and the sea bass drunken noodles. We added on some typical Thai plates such as pineapple fried rice, pad see ew, and the spicy garlic chicken wings. The nam kao tod beef was good, but inconsistent. Some of the pieces were perfect, while others were more tough and dry. The must-try dish of the night was the sea bass. The fish was perfectly fried, but the drunken noodles left much to be desired. The pineapple fried rice was and pad see ew were average. We finished with a mango sticky rice for dessert, which was amazing. The mangos were as sweet as can be and the sticky rice was topped with just the right amount of lavender to give it a floral aroma with every bite. Overall, the sea bass was a bit pricey and the other dishes were okay, but it was a good meal, albeit pricey for Thai. I have to return to try the garlic prawns.

Most Thai restaurants in the U.S. are really set up for western taste buds. Meaning, they are not really the type or the taste of food you get in Thailand. At Lotus of Siam, yes, they have the Pad Thai and things like that for those who do not like the spiciness of traditional Thai food, but what they also have is a great selection of true traditional Thai dishes, meaning they are spicy. If you want to eat true Thai food, look on the menu under the Northern Thai section and the Chef's Choice. The food is great !This restaurant also has a vast selection of wine. This is very unusual for a Thai restaurant. Personally, though I love a nice bottle of wine, I don't really think of wine in association with Thai food. But, they do have it, if you want it. Plus, they also have a good selection of beer, Thai Iced Coffee, and other drinks like that. This restaurant is located in a strip mall. Though there are several other international restaurants around it, the outside is not inviting. Don't let this scare you off. Once inside the restaurant is very nice.

I worked at Casino Royale on the Strip as a bartender and sometimes just showed up at the Cheetah and jumped on the pole. There was a pomegranate tree growing outside my window on Gypsy Lane, and hummingbirds would fly up to feed at it. Air travel was wonderful in those days, so I would often take off for the weekend, to LA, SF, CO or NM. Nobody knew how amazing Lotus of Siam was, and it was my favorite place to eat.I moved back to NYC later that year, but I returned to Las Vegas in 2003 to get married. Having seen many other friends tie the knot since then, I will say this. Las Vegas weddings are the best. Don't just do a bachelor party. Make it one big party for everyone. No parents, no kids. Everyone arranges their own travel, and then block out some hotel rooms for your guests and have fun. Now that you have an idea of what I call romance, Lotus of Siam is a great date spot. It's been forever since I've been back to Vegas, but I recall this was tucked into a strip mall with a shooting range, a bail bonds, a pawn shop, a check cashing and a trashy lingerie shop. Basically, everything you want one stop shopping, even if you have to beg, borrow or steal, and why not go for the hat trick?Why am I remembering them? Because that was a seriously awesome time. They opened a NY restaurant, had a falling out with their business partner, who tried to make it fancy, and I respect that they wanted more management control, though they're so old, it was too much for them, running two locations. I appreciate how passionately they feel about the food and their reputation.

Amazing. I'll bet the plaza in which they're located was also pretty rundown back then, but the quality of their food has probably not lessened and their reputation has only soared.

Also very delicious but not suited for my palate was the yum nuah (#36A, $12.95), which is a great beef salad that's just too spicy for me and paralyzed me in fire and sweat for a few minutes. The spicy catfish with basil leaves (#85, $14.95) was a solid if small portion of sauteed fish in a basil sauceAfter recovering from the yum nuah, I delved into the Northern specialties. The khao soi (#A, $9.95) was one of my favorite tastes of the meal. To call it an egg noodle curry is not nearly doing it justice, so I'll just say that you'd better order it when you get the chance. The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes. The last item from this part of the menu was the nam prik ong (#I, $10.95), a non-spicy dish consisting of a red chili paste and various items to dip into it. Pretty nice, possibly worthy of a repeat, but not a palate dazzler either.I think the best item we had may have been the garlic prawns (on the chef's choice menu, $22.95). They are certainly pricey, and they are actually kinda worth it. Very crunchy, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. And even considering the modest portions of other dishes, definitely a splurge.Having finally had items from the proper menu, I can now confidently express my opinion that Lotus of Siam deserves all of its praise. I don't know if I'd tell somebody to fly here just for one restaurant, but when you are in Las Vegas, you must make this a destination. Oh, and you'll definitely want to reserve well in advance if you choose dinner hours.

It is my benchmark for all Thai places that I visit... This restaurant is a MUST try if you live in, or visit Las Vegas.Let's go through my recommendations:1. Tom Yum Kai soup (5/5): The hot pot size feeds 5-6 and it's only $11.95. It's not overwhelmingly spicy, but it has a good kick. The lemon grass and straw mushrooms make the soup taste amazing!2. Crispy Duck with Panang \u00a0(5/5): I would actually rate this a 6 on a 5-point scale. This is my FAVORITE DISH at Lotus. The duck is so crispy with the curry on top of it. This dish is literally to die for.3. Garlic Prawns (5/5): This is on the Chefs Choice menu - these are deep fried prawns with the shells on them and they are saut\u00e9ed with garlic and pepper. Don't peel the shells! This is one of the most amazing dishes they have! Even though it's $21.95, it's very much worth the price. Get it!4. Khai Soi Braised Short Rib (5/5): This is also on the Chefs Choice menu - another one of my personal favorites. The braised short rib is so tender; you can cut it easily with a fork. It's served over thai egg noodle in curry sauce, served with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables. This dish is a little pricey too at $20.95, but worth every penny.5. Panang Curry with Chicken (4/5): The panang curry is really good here too. We rode it with chicken. It's only $11.95 for this dish, and it's a great traditional Thai dish to get with your meal.6. Drunken Noodle Seafood (4/5): The drunken noodle seafood is one of their top recommendations. These are pan fried flat rice noodles served with an assortment of different seafood (mussels, calamari rings, shrimp, etc.). It is only $12.95, but I must warn that this is a little bit on the spicy side, i.e. more than we expected.7. Pineapple Fried Rice (4/5): We ordered this to share with a larger group, and it was surprisingly really good. I normally don't order fried rice when I go to a Thai restaurant because I can make it at home, but this was really good. Only $9.95 too for a good-sized order of fried rice.You can't go wrong with any of the options I've listed above. Of course, if there are just two of you going, you aren't going to order all 7 of the dishes (unless you are really hungry), but the top recommendations I have are the Crispy Duck Panang, the Garlic Prawns, and the Khai Soi Braised Short Rib. Not a whole lot of veggies in those options, but ehhhh, these are the best ones. Can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can pay a visit to Lotus of Siam again. The restaurant itself is not in the best of neighborhoods, and from the outside, it looks like it could be a really crappy place, but do not be fooled.

We went there for lunch, and the large restaurant was full within 30 minutes of opening.We decided to order some of the dishes we saw in the show that were from the Northern section of the menu. The Khao Soi with pork was delicious and had very tender pork with vegetables in a curry sauce with coconut milk and noodles. We also tried the Nam Prik Ong, which is a pork and tomato mixture served with fresh veggies and pork rinds for dipping. It was much better than I expected! The star of the show, however, was the Garlic Prawns! This absolutely delicious dish consists of large shrimp that are deep fried with the shell and topped with a fantastic garlic sauce. It sounds unusual, but the shell is supposed to be eaten, and the way that it's prepared makes it almost like a shrimp chip. We liked the Garlic Prawns so much that we ordered a second dish! It's true that Lotus of Siam is located far from the Vegas Strip in a remote area, but it's worth traveling to! It can take a while for cabs to come pick you up when called, so I suggest waiting to snag a cab that's dropping off someone instead.

After seeing several articles, an Anthony Bourdain episodes, and a James Beard elect (2011) award- I could not wait to try it. So I was lucky enough to go twice here over the course of the weekend. I went Saturday (5:30PM- opening time) & Sunday 6PM, both without reservations. At opening, you may see a massive line, but it moves fast and you get a seat almost right away. If you wait a half hour, the wait bumps up to 1 hour. So either get a reservation or go right when it opens. After coming here twice, I have to give Lotus of Siam all around compliments:1) The staff- \u00a0they are very friendly and amazingly fast. \u00a0 If you are in a rush , you can go from seating to check in 30 min. But at the same time, if you are enjoying yourself and chatting, they do not rush you. 2) The management's ethics- While I was waiting for a table on Sunday, about six 60+ year old customers (not sure which European country they hailed from) came in and seemed highly annoyed about an hour wait. Those of us patiently waiting (which included grandparents and children) watched as one man in the group pulled out a wad of cash,and tucked $40-60 dollars in his palm to bribe the staff for a table. This guy continued to haggle with the staff for about 10 minutes. But the staff continued to decline his bribe and did not let him skip ahead of anyone. They gained a huge amount of respect from me and the the other dinner's who saw these events play out.3) The food- Delicious and extremely well priced. Now I enjoy a really spicy meal and want to roll my eyes when people ask me \"are you SURE you want spicy...it's really spicy!\" \u00a0I usually like it as hot as it comes. But something made me feel like the food was going to be authentic here so I went \"medium spice.\" For me this was perfect, enough to tingle the lips and make the nose run a little, but not too much to make me chug a glass of milk. If you cannot handle spice, go well below medium.Appetizers I tried: -Golden Fried Tofu (like any other place, good but nothing unique)-Nam Kao Tod (Small dish but packed with spice and flavor, really loved this)Dishes I tried: -Chili & Basil Seafood combo (delicious with rich basil flavor, good kick to it too)- Pad Se Ew (basic dish but well made)-Thum Ka Noon (Rich, spicy dish with jackfuit but not heavy at all, one of my favorites)- Kang Hung Lay (sweet and spicy pork curry, heavier dish but packed with flavor)Dessert: -Mango and sticky Rice (basic dish but really fresh mango and rice was not dried, delicious!)This place was great and will be a must on future Vegas trips!", "Date": "2014-05-27", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Lawrence B.", "ReviewID": "-lRDdUrwminyuOsE9IqmLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OMG! #foodsnob #expectingoverhype #bestthaifood #exceededallexpectationsFood +Service +Value + (for amazing food)Atmosphere +", "Date": "2014-06-13", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Sarah T.", "ReviewID": "UM4xPAdnJGse4HWdrGj8Vg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm partial to Anthony Bourdain.

I don't know if it was because maybe what we ordered weren't their \"stellar\" dishes but oh, boy. I wasn't a happy camper. We got the Tom Yum Goong, Panang Curry, Pad Thai and my dad got an extra bowl of noodles in soup with meatball type things floating. I'm sorry, but my go-to spot in Thai Town in L.A. does a better job at preparing what I had ordered. That Tom Yum Goong was just pure sourness with no kick whatsoever (my stepmom asked them to make it spicy in Thai). The Panang and Pad Thai were both on the sweeter side as well. My stepmom agreed to what I had to say as well and, she's a straight-up, legit Thai lady herself. I only have the privilege of saying that I've been to Thailand but she's got it all in her blood. Her opinion has to count as something, right?I'm not ready to cross them out my list just yet.

He said it was the best Thai in Vegas, hands down. It's located in an economically--and otherwise--depressed strip mall. (There's a bedraggled \"Adult Day Care\" two doors down with a flickering, half-lit neon sign. Love you, mom and dad.) I'm not complaining about that, though. In my experience if a local tells you that something's the best and it's in a terrible location, you're usually in for a real treat. So I was actually getting more excited. A few of our party were under 5 minutes late and the staff acted like they were doing us a favor by seating us. They were very busy, but we *did* have reservations. When the waiter came by, he was very much in a hurry. As a NYer, I don't generally have a problem with that, but I rarely see a waiter rush like that, with no effort to be hospitable at all. The guy who filled our waters was far more personable and helpful. I ordered the Massaman Curry, which is a standard/classic dish. When I got it it wasn't hot, but warm verging on room temperature and it sat there cooling more as we waited several minutes for the rice to arrive. When I tasted it, the flavors were great, but there was no spice at all.

It's not remotely fancy inside and the location is in a dirty shopping center in a bad part of town, but the food is unbelievably exceptional. Reservations are definitely recommended if you want to eat on a weekend evening at a preferable dining hour, but don't give up if you call ahead and the receptionist says they're booked. Simply walk in around 9-9:15 (they close at 10) and you probably won't wait for more than 20 minutes or so. Ask the receptionist and she'll tell you the same thing.And if you're looking for some cheap after-dinner entertainment, I suggest sitting in your car for a few minutes and checking out the people coming and going from \"The Green Door\" (the supposedly world famous swingers club inside the same shopping center).

We ordered the Crispy Duck Panang, Nam Prik Ong and Combination Fried Rice. The portions aren't as huge as you're probably used to from other Thai places, but that was enough to fill two people up. The Crispy Duck Panang was the clear highlight of the meal -- tender duck, crisp skin, spicy & creamy panang sauce. On their 1-10 spicy level, we got a 6 and it had a perfect amount of spice to it. Definitely don't discard the basil garnish -- mix it in with the sauce, eat it with your rice. Yum!

I would probably stick to just beef fried rice or shrimp fried rice, since the chicken didn't really add anything to the dish.The Nam Prik Ong was what I really came here for -- I'd heard Ming Tsai raving about it on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate -- and honestly, I was underwhelmed. Not sure if they were just having an off-batch, but it wasn't as complex or flavorful as I expected it to be.

I've proven her wrong with a duck curry in the Sacramento area (of all places) and had little doubt she would love this place. We tried calling to make reservations, because there was a wait even with reservations the last time I came. But nobody answered the phone, so we just decided to go and stick it out if it wasn't too long. My girl put her name on the list and was told ten to fifteen minutes, but it ended up being closer to thirty. Expected and not a big deal. With all that time in the lobby waiting, I was able to read some random articles on the walls and one food review, although older, mentioned several dishes that sounded quite interesting. When it came time to order, I decided to go with some of the items that were recommended in that article. We are both soup addicts and instead of going with the safe choices I've always gone with at Thai restaurants (Tom Yum and Tom Kha), I suggested we try the En Tuan. It's a spicy and sour beef tendon soup. We requested it at 8/10 spice and my girl thought it packed a little too much heat, but I absolutely loved it. The fragrance from the broth is mesmerizing and the consistency of the soup is great. Not too thick or thin. Generous amounts of beef slices and topped off with some green onions and cilantro that add a nice, fresh contrast. A bowl will only set you back $8.95 and that is more than enough for two people to share. Highly recommend!Another dish that was raved about in that article was the Issan Sausage. Two sausages sliced in bite size pieces (a little larger than bite size actually) that comes on a plate with peanuts, chili, ginger and lettuce. We weren't sure how to attack this dish, but when we asked our waiter, he informed us that there is no way correct way to eat this. The sausages are described as \"sour\", but I didn't really feel that. There was a bit of tartness and the flavor was definitely unique and much different than other sausages I've had. The outer layer had that good sausage snap and the inside was juicy and delicious. For our entree, it was an easy decision as we both love duck curry. They have a roasted duck curry priced around $13 under the Curries section of the menu, but do yourself a favor and pay the $23.95 for the crispy duck in Panang curry. We also ordered this at an 8/10 spice level, and this time, it was beyond scorching for me while my girl was slurping up the curry sauce like it was nothing. The flavor in this dish is out of this world. The crispiness and quality of the duck was just as good as the last time I had it.

The service here was on point and when i mean on point, full waters, back to back beers and fast check turn around. Overall I'm a fan for a very delicious meal, yeah i cant base it for any other northern thai restaurant but as far as taste goes this place is amazing and i will be back thank you Anthony bourdain", "Date": "2014-06-05", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Sisley C.", "ReviewID": "7DsJn8ThvGE94s0RZAYoXg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place is a true \"hidden\" gem off of the strip.

They peel the skin but keep it semi attached to the meat of the shrimp so that you get the crunch of both. 3) Veggie tom yum soup - the perfect combo of spicy and sour. 4) Pad Thai - pretty good, but not their best dish.

You know it's legit when your cabbie perks up immediately when you mention that you want to be taken there from your hotel on the Strip. During my most recent trip to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago, I boarded a cab from the Palazzo and indicated to the cab driver to take me to the Lotus of Siam. He simply said in his Yugoslavian accent: \"best Thai food in Las Vegas...hell, best Thai food in the country! I love that place.\" It seemed like an honest review, but not Yelp Elite caliber. So here goes mine, hopefully a bit more fleshed out:Lotus lets people in around 5:30pm for dinner service. Knowing this, if you arrive a little before this time, you will see a group of people standing outside, all wanting to be the first one in. There's no order to the way people congregate outside, but there's an unspoken rule to just keep a mental tab as to who arrives after you, and when the doors swing open, to make it inside the restaurant before them. The sooner you sit, the sooner you eat! No pushing or shoving, though the temptation to invade others' personal space is strong as you try to think of what to order in advance in your head.As you shuffle inside, you'll be greeted by newspaper snipets featuring Lotus in the local papers. You'll see plenty of photos of famous people (both American and presumably Thai) over the years, enjoying the food at this Las Vegas institution.According to others in my group, the restaurant was expanded relatively recently to include the empty neighboring space. That effectively allowed the owners to add a wine bar and a wine storage room, as well as more dining space. It doesn't seem like there's much activity going on at the strip mall where Lotus is located, so the whole wing of the building can be converted to more Lotus as far as I'm concerned. It would be way better that way, really.Service has always been kind and friendly whenever I come here, as per Thai tradition. I've only been a couple of times, but with all the stuff I've ordered and shared with my group (it's an extensive menu), I did not find one thing I did not like.I recommend the jumbo fried shrimp/prawns to open things up. You can, and should, eat the skin. I don't usually do so with any fried shrimp, but the way it was cooked with the peppering and seasoning, it was almost like having twice as much prawn. Those will disappear in a couple of minutes (because of some secret crack-like substance that the cooks sprinkle into the batter, I'm sure), so I also recommend the yellow curry (though I don't think the color matters...they're all really savory and the spice level can be adjusted to your liking) and the fried, boneless catfish (either with curry paste or garlic pepper sauce). Eat that with a side of salad and some white rice and wash it down with some Singha, and you'll be golden.As mentioned earlier, you can take a cab here from the Strip if you're visiting from out of town, or drive your own car here. The only problem is getting a cab back to your hotel or next destination. You may want to have the host arrange a ride back for you before you sit down to eat, otherwise, you may have to go out into Sahara Road and flag one down yourself or pray that you find one just emptied of passengers intent on coming here in the parking lot.

There was the fish but it was market price (so expensive). We thought you know its thai big portions we were still hungry! so we asked for the menu again and it took so long for us to look and find we want and we just told the waiter what he recommended.

Lucky me that trip came this year and I knew that Lotus of Siam was the ONE place that was a must-do for me.Located in a nondescript strip mall about a $15-$20 cab drive away from the main strip, Lotus of Siam is unassuming from the outside but has been praised as one of the best Thai restaurants in America. \u00a0We gave the doorman at the hotel the address and as the cab pulled up all he said was \"Lotus of Siam\"...no address needed. When you pull up you might be questionable but trust me, looks are deceiving!Lotus of Siam is open for lunch and dinner and while we had initially planned a lunch visit, we got distracted and pushed it back to dinner. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for the night so we arrived early right before they opened to secure a seat. If you plan in advance I would definitely make a reservation if you want to eat at a more \"peak\" time, but they do have a bar where you can try a glass from their lengthy wine menu while you wait.I had done my fair amount of research ahead of time (because I'm a nerd like that) so I knew exactly what I planned on ordering. Lotus of Siam is a bit unique because they offer quite a few Northern Thai dishes, which you don't see on the menus of most Thai restaurants. Our first dish was the very popular Tom Kah Kai soup. Chicken, coconut milk, mushrooms, lemongrass, and lime...this was quite possibly one of the best soups I've ever eaten. We chose a spice level of medium for all of our dishes and found it to be perfect for our taste-a good amount of heat but nothing that was searing away our taste buds.After the soup came the Garlic Prawns. This is one of their most popular dishes and it's no wonder why...deep fried prawns with shells that crisp up like potato chips, saut\u00e9ed in a tasty garlic sauce and cooked to perfection. \u00a0Delicious!!Next up...Braised Short Rib with Panang. The short rib wasn't the best I've ever had but the sauce-a red cream curry with cognac-was fantastic and absolutely made the dish. It definitely took some restraint to stop from licking the bowl!Our last dish before dessert was one of my go-to Thai carry-out choices....good 'ol Pad Thai. But this was no ordinary Pad Thai-this was the best Pad Thai I've ever eaten, and I have eaten A LOT of Pad Thai. The flavors, the spice level, the crispy vegetables, and of course the noodles....I wanted this whole dish to myself!Last but not least was dessert. We were on the brink of stuffed but I couldn't leave without a few sweet bites. This was actually my first time trying sticky rice and I really enjoyed it. The warm rice with the beautiful, fresh, sweet mango was a great combo and \u00a0add in a cold bite of the coconut ice cream...the perfect ending to a great meal!From start to finish, from wine to dessert and everything in between, Lotus of Siam lived up to all of my expectations and then some. If you're in Vegas I highly recommend venturing off the strip to give Lotus of Siam a try for yourself, I know this has now made it onto my must-do list for all future trips to LV!", "Date": "2014-02-07", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "rachel c.", "ReviewID": "G42NtVax__ryXb9ir5ZfBw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I now understand what all the hype is about.

First off let me say that it is in a strip mall that you would not ever go to unless you were going here. If you think to yourself on the way that \"this cannot possibly be the place\" then you are headed in the right direction. The good news is once you get there it's a totally different scene on the inside. Deceptively large and always busy, this place sports a really fine wine selection and some of the best Thai cuisine on the planet.My friends who live in LV and have been to Thailand several times say it is the real deal for authentic and the menu is almost overwhelming with original Thai dishes. So for starters the Thom Ka is excellent, 1-10 spice scale and it comes in a hot pot with the flame going strong as it delivered to the table. It is certainly enough to share but of course you have to agree on the spice level. I am curry junkie so that's the route I usually go, and the Panang is my flavor of choice, no matter the meat I have not been disappointed ever with the quality. I have had Chicken and Shrimp Panang and both were excellent.On one trip to Lotus we had a hard core vegan among us, this was no problem at all and they made everything to order just the way she wanted it and got really creative and used veggies and fruits that none of us besides her had ever heard of. I am always amazed at the shear volume of people coming through this place. On the weekend you cannot get in, they do take reservations but they normally don't answer the phone, as it is so busy so go during the week and expect a wait even then or eat later that seems to work too.So go here and get anything you want, I would recommend this place for those new to Thai and veterans alike as everyone can get something they will love.", "Date": "2014-02-19", "Author_Location": "Louisville, KY"}, {"Author": "S D.", "ReviewID": "ZxFj2XkrBFjHWdCHVZ_r8w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first time I tried this place with my bf we had to get our order to go because the sit down dinner was a 2-he wait (no reservation) opposed to the to go wait was 45 minutes long.It is HIGHLY recommended to make reservations to solve the wait time.

I've been to Thailand and I love Thai food so needless to say I was excited. When I called to make reservations I was told that they could only be made one day in advance. So we ended up going somewhere else but made a reservation for the following day. When we got there I was already excited. It's in a run of the mill strip mall and there was already a line out the door. We got there 20 minutes early and still had to wait 25 minutes after our original reservation time. However, this did not bother us because we were told to go to the bar and have a drink. When we finally got seated I was a little overwhelmed with all of the options.

Although I have ordered off the menu a few times, I usually go to Lotus for their lunch buffet, and that's what we did today.At first glance, the buffet doesn't look like much -- especially when compared to other buffets offered on the Strip. But for $10.99, you get a pretty thorough representation of traditional Thai offerings. I'm not sure if the selections change daily, but today there was no beef or seafood; however, there were plenty of chicken, tofu, and vegetable dishes to go around. There was also a lot of fried fare, including egg rolls, shrimp and curry puffs, tempura vegetables, and fried banana (basically, a banana egg roll). I steered clear of the fried food and headed straight for the chicken noodle soup, which is one of my favorite things at Lotus. I don't think this is on the regular menu, and it's not what you would consider traditional chicken noodle soup, but I could eat this all day. It looks like a hot and sour soup with ground chicken and wide rice noodles, but it has a hint of spice (anise?) that's addictive. I've had this with duck on the buffet before and it was fantastic, but this is almost as good. My husband was not as pleased with the egg drop soup, which could more appropriately be called \"cilantro soup with egg.\" (He has that weird gene where cilantro tastes like soap, so any cilantro at all is too much for him. I love cilantro, but it was a little overwhelming for me, too.)The main courses included pad thai, pad woo sen, curry chicken, chow mein, and ginger tofu (listed in order of my preference). There are orange slices and cantaloupe for dessert along with the aforementioned banana egg roll. (I consider this last item a dessert option. Don't be like my husband and mistake it for a savory dish -- it sure tastes crappy with soy sauce on it!)Newbies and foodies may want to order off the extensive menu, but for anyone in search of a quick and tasty Thai lunch, I suggest trying the buffet (if, for nothing else, one of the best soups in town).", "Date": "2014-02-17", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Fritz D.", "ReviewID": "pLgl1GtMHeY2Uq9WxlO5GA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Food took forever, but it was delicious.I wish I knew what I ate, but my cousin the foodie did the ordering.My first visit here last September, I didn't love the food because she ordered a bit too exotic for me.

I put my name on the waiting list and was told it would be a 25 minute wait and that I could wait at the Bar. When I went to the bar all the seats were taken as well so I had no choice but to wait outside the restaurant. Luckily, it wasn't very busy that night and I only had to wait for 15 minutes for a party of 2. BEWARE usually it's about a 2 hour wait. I ordered the Nam Kao Tod which is a crispy rice that's quite sour tasting. In my opinion it was a little too sour for a rice dish. Next I had the coconut chicken soup (Tom Kah Kai) and it tasted like coconut milk mixed with chile oil. It was sweet so it seemed like a dessert but it had chicken and mushrooms which also made the dish savory. This mixture was a bit too odd for me and I would definitely not order this dish again. The Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab was also pretty disappointing considering the price. It was 18.95 with a small plate of noodles with a sprinkle of soft shell crab legs. Out of all the dishes I ordered I only liked the Musaman curry which was OK.

With all of the top notch Thai places in LA that is a rather bold statement and I decided I must witness such cuisine myself. My wife and I are in Vegas and we decide to make the trek from the strip to this place that is located in an oddball shopping center. We saw the place and were skeptical... we walked in and our nostrils were immediately welcomed by delicious Thai aromas. Skepticism melted away as we walked past the bunch of people waiting around for a table. We put our name down and the wait was long - I wish we had made a reservation. That right there folks is the only gripe I have.When the hostess took us to our table she warned us that since they are busy the wait for our food might be lengthy. At that point we had already invested too much time to turn back and after looking at all of the yelp reviews we were ready to try this stuff, so that warning did not detour us. We were then greeted by a friendly waiter and he took our drink and food orders efficiently. The hostess' warning turned out to be unnecessary as our food came out in a very reasonable amount of time. Okay, enough semantics. The FOOD. Oh, the glorious food. The drunken noodles with soft-shell crab were stunning. I took the first bite and I felt my eyes pop out of my head. The flavors were so amazing! Then the panang curry with crispy duck was unbelievable. I've had \"crispy duck\" before and never, never in my life has it been as delightfully crispy as it is here. Perfection! \u00a0My wife and I dine at some pretty spectacular places when we are in Vegas and we have talked about this meal more than any other. I will certainly be returning to this place each and every time I go to Vegas. So, yes. Mister fancy chef dude's bold statement is absolutely valid.

It's located in an odd spot in one of Vegas's older strip malls... if you're dining here at night you're in for an adventure, there's definitely a lot of unique neighbors. I came here on a Thursday night at 8:45pm with two of my friends. They were pretty busy but not packed and we were able to get seated immediately.It was an interesting place; in the middle of the restaurant they had a huge wine selection concealed behind a glass wall. Additionally like a lot of popular asian restaurants there always seems to be more Americans than asian patrons. Anyways... after we were seated our server Jim, (I don't think that was his real name), was a phenomenal guy. He must have been working there for a while because he knew everything and anything about the menu! Jim made some great recommendations from the menu and always checked back to see if we were doing fine. We ended up ordering quite a bit of food, but my favorites were #14. Nam Kao Tod, which was rice flavored with lemon, it was very savory and #13B Moo Dad Dew, which was the best beef jerky I've ever had.Overall it wasn't a bad experience. I would rate this place 3/5 but we ended up finding hair in the drunken rice and that was an immediate red flag. Especially the way the server had handled the issue. Our other server, (not Jim), wasn't even sure how to go about it. His first response was to bring us a new plate; we pretty much had to send back the entire dish until they removed it from our check.We ended up spending $44 for 3 people. (That was after the drunken rice was taken off of our bill).Lotus of Siam is definitely your typical mom & pop shop, there were handwritten \"out of order signs\" on paper place mats near the restrooms and you could clearly see the cleaning supplies in the restroom. Also the seating in the restaurant is a bit crowded, there's tables randomly scattered everywhere.

First night (Sunday) I tried to make a reservation and they told me after the waiting list gets long enough, they stop taking reservations - you better just show up and get on the list. So we tried again Monday. This time we showed up in person and got on the list. Not too hard to spot - if you're travelling eastbound on Sahara heading away from the Strip you'll eventually see the backside of a dingy mall and LOTUS OF SIAM quite visible on the wall on the south side of Sahara. You then make the next turn and find a parking spot in the mall close to the restaurant. Shouldn't be hard at night since most of the businesses are either closed or not anywhere near as busy as Lotus Of Siam. We had about an hour's wait and the waiting area only has a few chairs so we decided to venture the mall outside. The rest of the mall is mostly Korean bars or restaurants plus a few sketchy \"clubs.\" None of the restaurants seemed to be \"hopping.\" Lotus Of Siam probably had more people in it than all the surrounding businesses combined. There were lots of shuttered businesses - perhaps this was once a thriving Koreatown in Las Vegas but this mall's best days are definitely in the past. Maybe it's a lot more thriving during the day but walking around there at night gave me a kinda creepy vibe. So we circled the whole place and came back and were seated not long after. I guess some folks couldn't wait any longer and left as a few names the hostess called out did not produce any acknowledgement from the people still sitting and waiting. There were so many people in the restaurant that when we finally got seated almost elbow to elbow next to the people at the tables on either side it felt like we were in a crowded diner. Couldn't they just buy out one of the bigger empty lots around and expand? So anyway, we ordered the crispy duck in Panang curry, the crispy garlic prawns, and our squeamish pal ordered the Panang curry with chicken. The crispy duck was awesome. So were the prawns - you eat the whole thing - shell and all - as we were instructed by our waiter. The Panang curry with chicken was rather lackluster in comparison but that was pretty much eaten by our unadventurous buddy who won't eat seafood and for whom duck was too exotic. Based on the first two dishes I'd say this place lives up to the hype. Portions weren't overly huge and the price was a little steep but we left satisfied. We'll probably be back one day. I'll say it would probably be worthwhile to check this place out if you're actually quite familiar with Thai food.

I heard just endless raves about this place and I had hoped it was warranted. After that meal? It was warranted. I tried pretty much everything we ordered. Not one dish was a weak link. I loved, loved, LOVED both the beef tamarind and the butterfly shrimp. The beef was cooked really to perfection. No blood, grilled right without a slightly burnt taste. The shrimp was crispy and so tasty. Great food, very little noise so you could talk to people at the table, servers who let you eat in peace.Great place.

(Northern, Southern, etc.) My bf and I had decided early on that we would eat at the lunch buffet instead so we arrived at around 11:45 am and the restaurant was already pretty packed. Lotus of Siam opens at 11:30 am and the lunch buffet is served from 11:30 am-2:30 pm.For $10.99 a person, the lunch buffet is worth the price because there were many different options (steamed, stir-fry and fried) to select from. There was your standard sliced fruit (green melon, watermelon and pineapple) and salad. The Thai food included steamed white rice, Thai fried rice, chow mein, pad thai, pad see ew, chicken green curry, a tofu stir-fry and another vegetable stir-fry. The fried food included: egg rolls, curry wontons, tempura and delicious fried bananas! There were also 2 types of soups available: a hot and sour soup and a soup with clear broth. My bf preferred the soup with the clear broth and vegetables.For me, the stand out dishes were the pad thai and green chicken curry! Both were tasty and the green chicken curry had large chunks of both vegetables and chicken. I even went back for seconds of the curry! The service was good. It looked like there were only 1-2 people working the front of the restaurant and our waters were refilled.Bottom line: This Thai place may be out off the strip but it is well worth the drive for good AYCE Thai food.

It was slightly tangy and when you eat it with the cabbage provided, it's the perfect blend of crunchy, zesty, and freshness. I have never had anything like this so I truly enjoyed it! The Tom Kah Kai came out next and this was probably my least favorite dish. I felt like the taste was off, maybe too much coconut milk? I've had better elsewhere. The Garlic Prawns were SO good! A bit pricey compared to the other dishes but the prawns were very big and juicy and were fried to perfection. The seasoning on the prawns was so delicious! The curry was the best I've ever had.

It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly crispy and not drenched in oil.

Again, it didn't come out very hot so that was disappointing. And the spicy level of 5 (which I heard would be pretty spicy) was not spicy at all. Also, I'm not a fan when restaurants (especially with such a hyped up name) uses imitation crab meat or anything for that matter, so that was slightly disappointing. The pineapple fried rice had yellow curry in it so that was interesting, but not quite my preference. It was just OK and I'd never order it there again.

I've tried it twice so far debating on what I should rate it. From all the reviews, I guess I had really huge expectations from this place especially since I am a big Thai food lover.One thing I really like about this place is that the menu has Northern style cuisine. I actually have never tried Northern style Thai so it was a really cool change of pace. A big tip is that this place gets packed during busy hours. I came once for lunch and there was about 1-130 hr wait so I had to eat somewhere else. There was no way I was going to wait an hour for lunch. The second time I came, I came after dinner time around 900 and we still had to wait about 15 mins to be seated. The third time, I made reservations around 530 and had no problems getting a table.The service is good. When it's not too busy the waiters will be on point. But when it starts getting busier, you realize that you don't exactly have a certain waiter assigned to you and it's pretty much a free for all. The more packed it is, the less good service you'll receive. When I came around 530 when it was empty, the waiters were really fast on our demands. But by the time it was hitting 700, it was hard to track down our waiter bc he was off running somewhere else.We ordered an array of food. Drunken noodles with sea bass and soft shell crab, garlic prawns, panang curry with crispy duck, mussels and beef satay. All were okay. Nothing spectacular of sort. The drunken noodles were really OILY!! I have no idea why people keep raving about it but it's so doused with sauce and the noodles get soggy. The noodles break apart easily that whenever you pick it up with chopsticks you can't get a good bite. The garlic prawns were okay. I really like the crispness but I expected more garlic. Did not have a hint of garlic to it. My favorite was the panang curry with crispy duck. The duck was super crispy even when soaked in curry and the panang curry is sooo good!! The only downside to this dish is that they give you TOO LITTLE CURRY compared to the amount of duck!!!Overall, this place is good. I don't think it's spectacular as some people rave it to be.

FOODI'm not exactly sure of the names of everything we ordered because the waiter recommended it all and we just went with the flow. We had a variety of dishes (3 of each one) that were all equally delicious and perfect in taste!!! My favorites were probably the Garlic Prawns (GIANT prawns perfectly battered and seasoned), the Crispy Duck Penang (oh my gosh), Papaya Salad (fresh, crispy salad), Pad Thai (just plain DELISH). The CRISPY DUCK PENANG is seriously the bombbbbbbb. It's perfectly fried, juicy and the curry sauce is sooooo good omg. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. The Riesling wine was also delicious and went well with all of the food.SERVICEThe service was great! The servers constantly refilled our water and asked if we were enjoying our food. However, we were there for a birthday celebration and when he asked if he should bring out the cake, I told him we needed a bit more time but they brought it out with the candles lit (perhaps he misunderstood me..?). We had to ask him to blow it out and wait a little bit because we were waiting for the rest of our party to come back to their seats. After about 5-10 minutes he lit the candles again and started giving us the cake again even though we were still waiting for our party to sit back down so we just had to do the cake. This part was a bit rushed but it was fine. The service while we were dining was good and I have no complaints other than the cake incident haha.PARKINGThere is a vast amount of parking as there is a hugeee lot out front.

This was the closest place to pop up on our way back to Arizona so we decided to stop by and give it a whirl.This place is by FAR the best Thai food that I have had in America so far. But that might not really be saying much as the rest of the places have been in Arizona. But there is no place in AZ that serve Isaan food and mm mm mmmm I have missed me some Isaan food. Seeing as how both of us have not had Isaan food since we were last in Thailand, we decided to splurge a little and ended up with a $90 bill between the two of us. I'm going to just reiterate that every single dish we ordered was the best that we've had in the states.We started out with some Moo Dad Deaw (Issan Style Pork Jerky) This was one of my favorite dishes in Thailand and I was just beyond ecstatic when I finally found in a restaurant here. Som Tum (papaya salad) with some sticky rice to dip it in was next. It was funny to us when the waitress came by and was like \"Oh you eat just like Thai style!\" Tip. Try it. Soaking up the Som Tum juice with the sticky rice is oh so delicious. Again I find it hard to find a place that serves a good Som Tum AND have the sticky rice available so I was extremely excited. We also ordered the Tom Yum Kai soup to start out with too and it absolutely hit the spot. Then we finally reached our main courses. We decided on getting the Khao Soi and the Northern Larb. These are both Isaan (Northern region) style food that we have found impossible to find in Arizona. I'm not going to lie, the larb absolutely kicked my ass. But it usually does everywhere I have it. The dish was amazing yet I have forgotten how hot Isaan spicy really is. The Khao Soi is a noodle curry dish that is absolutely divine. I don't think that you really find this combination too much so I was glad to finally have it again.I can't wait to come back already to get some of the other dishes that I have been searching to no avail for. People might go to Vegas for gambling but I am coming back for the Thai food. It might not save me any money but it will absolutely be worth it.The only weird part of the experience might have been the fact that there was a empty table next to us the entire time. The place was hopping, the waiting parties at the bar were getting to be ridiculous, yet there was a table for four right next to us that was left empty. Now we had a couple theories for this. A. It might have been because we smelled. Everybody was in their Night out getups and here we were in shorts and a tshirt covered with a couple layers of dirt. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a certain odor permeating around us. B. We had spicy food. This entails me sweating like a pig.

The alcohol list is also equally as extensive, for those that choose to have some with their meal. After reading the great reviews about the drunken noodles, I decided on the seafood drunken noodles ($13). I had other people in my party get chicken pad Thai and chicken panang. The drunken noodles came in a flavorful brown sauce, cooked well. I wasn't too impressed with the seafood mixture though. It looked like it came out of one of those cheaper seafood mixes you get in the freezer section at the Asian grocery store. It had pre-cut slices of calamari, scallops, mussels, and imitation crab. The seafood itself tasted just OK. The calamari did taste a little tough though. I asked for the dish \"medium\" spice level, and I thought it was spot-on. It was spicy enough to give you some kick to your meal, but mild enough that you won't be drowning yourself in gallons of water to cool off from the heat. The person that had the chicken pad Thai was very satisfied with her meal, and the person that had the chicken panang thought it was good, albeit also a little pricy for what he got.Service was excellent despite it being very busy.

We also ordered a green curry with chicken, which wasn't bad, but it didn't amaze me. I've had much better green curry at any reg Thai joint back home in New York. Now... the appetizer that the waiter said we HAD to order was GROSS. It's some crispy rice sort of thing.. and it's sour, and sour, and sour, and also expired tasting. Why is it their most popular item? People in Vegas must be weird then, sorry guys. Oh, the lady behind the bar area was also rude. She had a huge diamond on her finger and wasn't in a uniform, so she might be some kind of owner/manager. To me though, that means you should step it up a level and be even more nice, not be a snotface.

And I would gladly move to Thailand in a heartbeat if it weren't the sauna sweatbox of tropical equator hell, where \u00a0I'd look like a tool that had taken a shower in my clothes pretty much whenever I walked outside.... \u00a0not pretty. \u00a0So as a consolation, I've been terribly fortunate to have the best Thai restaurant in the U.S. right in my own back yard, (well, ten miles away but whatever) within the first week of moving here, I had my first experience at Lotus of Siam and my world has never been the same since. \u00a0And what a surprise that here, in this archaic mish mash of tired trashy tourist sin reeking of cheap vodka and regret, there lies a culinary palace in the most unsavory of places, but a landmark nonetheless, (and ever since it's small cameo on Top Chef, the hoards of tourists have increased tenfold, making wait times to over an hour at peak times). \u00a0In a rundown shopping center east of the Strip, Chef Saipin creates some the loveliest, humble yet sophisticated dishes that make up for the lack of ambience.Now please, please do not be disparaged by the desolate location and crappy shopping center facade; yes, it is dilapidated and no, your car will not get jacked (many a friend have periodically checked to see if their car's still there) no worries, the homeless keep an eye out for ya! \u00a0They've even told me I had a brake light out, which deserved a buck...good people, those cracky addicts...As you enter through what I can only imagine is akin to walking through the entryway of a Western Union in Compton, you've suddenly matrixed into a crowded, tiny vestibule that is indicative of the original size of the restaurant. \u00a0In fact it's recently gone trough an expansion, and when you've managed to squeeze past the herd, the room on the right is the expansion, while directly in front of you is the original dining room. \u00a0And the interior, although updated, has the exact the same finishes: green carpeting dark, mahogany wood chair rails, brass railings and oddly scaled glass drop chandeliers....it's like a time machine into retro...without the chic... which I have grown to absolutely love, like visiting grandma's house in the not so nice neighborhood during the Holidays.Apart from your typical Thai Apps, (Shrimp Toast, Stuffed Chicken Wings) \u00a0The Moo Dad Deaw is an awesome starter, akin to a Bar snack item, to be eaten with a nice cold beer. \u00a0These succulent, juicy, tender pieces of pork are the precursor to chicken fingers, you can easily pop these suckers one after one in your mouth; as a good accompaniment, have some Sticky Rice to go with it; go ahead wreck your diet, you weren't serious about those New Year's resolutions anyways...My favorite curry dish on the menu, which isn't you normal curry dish: \u00a0the Braised Short Rib with Penang Curry - this luxurious dish has all the depth and richness laid into it's protein not usually paired with Thai cuisine but definitely makes sense. \u00a0The hearty Short Rib goes so well with Penang, which is so good, Chef Saipin add Cognac into the Curry which elevates it to whole different level. \u00a0I bypass all the other curries cuz I know this one has the best flavor profile out of all of them.Lotus of Siam has made me a Pad See Ew snob, ever since that first time I ate here, the quality and technique that is executed here is so superb; I honestly have to remind myself that it's not supposed to be this good! \u00a0First, the Noodles have that perfect texture; mochi chewiness but firm enough to achieve maximum noodle satisfaction. \u00a0Combine it with the Egg, Beef, Broccoli and sweet Soy, it's such an addictive dish that's light yet savory with just a hint of Black Pepper to tighten the palate...just yum.Another all time favorite of mine: \u00a0Crab Fried Rice. \u00a0The way that Lotus makes this dish is pretty unbelievable, the rice is incredibly fluffy with a light infusion of crab broth. \u00a0I love finding morsels of Crab and Egg as if it's a treasure hunt and there's always a big hunk of Tomato wedge that's seems so out of scale with everything else that's on the plate. \u00a0But, as I've ordered this dish consecutively on numerous occasions, it's become a endearing and integral component that adds acidity to an otherwise aromatic, subtle dish. \u00a0It is a must-get item on the menu, but be warned, it's not an all out powerhouse of strong flavors, so you may want to order it as an earlier course before the heavier dishes arrive to your table. As dining experiences go, it's all over the place except for the food. \u00a0And in the end, with moderate prices, I can't really say that anything else affect the fact that Lotus has the best Thai food I've ever had. \u00a0Ratings (Out of Five Stars)Food: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05+++Ambience: \u00a02 (much improved hole in the wall)Service: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.75 (they're always so busy, it can't be helped)", "Date": "2013-03-04", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Melissa C.", "ReviewID": "RUH1xA9Fm2qAdtFIKp-jVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My second visit to the lunch buffet was as good as the first, which was a year or so ago.

It's located in some random strip mall that is pretty remote. \u00a0It's really the only place that looked open in the entire huge plaza. \u00a0There were some cars parked outside but as soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, I had no idea how big it was and how many people can fit inside this place. \u00a0After seeing all the people, I realized that all the cars parked outside were solely there to just eat at this location. \u00a0So of course, you start to get really excited. We made reservations for 8:30pm on a Friday night and we didn't have to wait at all unlike the walk-ins who had to wait about 45 min to an hour.We ordered the following (ranked in order of like/dislike): \u00a0Tom Kha Gai Soup - this was by far the best tom kha gai soup that we've had. \u00a0They cook it based on a Bangkok style (not sure what that means) but it's freaking good. \u00a0We got the medium spicy level which was a bit too spicy for my husband (he usually eats average spicy) but I loved it (I can take red hot spicy) and I actually wished it was a bit more spicier for me. \u00a0You can order it by cup, bowl or pot which is nice. \u00a0We ordered a bowl for the two of us and it was a little too much. \u00a0We still had some leftover that I really wanted to finish but we wanted to save room for the other stuff. Drunken Noodles with Soft Shell Crab - we were a little disappointed with this dish. \u00a0It has a lot of potential to be a great dish but when we got our noodles, they were stuck together in massive clumps and it came out mushy. \u00a0They didn't separate out the noodles and that part of the dish was just bad. \u00a0The flavoring was awesome and the soft shell crab on top was delicious. \u00a0I think it had to do with them being in a rush since the place was packed and I can tell they just wanted to serve you and get you out the door as soon as possible. \u00a0I would rather go back when it's not as busy and try this dish again to see if the noodles will actually be separated this time because this was a great dish but the noodles just fell flat for us. Deep Fried Garlic Prawns - this was another okay dish. \u00a0The prawns are deep fried so that you can also eat the shell. \u00a0The crunchy shells are amazing but we felt like there was something lacking from the flavor of the garlic prawns, almost like it needed a dipping sauce or something else. \u00a0We actually took them and dipped them in the drunken noodle sauce which made them taste better. Massaman Curry with Chicken - I kept reading about all the reviews for the curry so we had to order one to try. \u00a0The portion size of this curry was pretty small. \u00a0It was a very sweet curry and almost too sweet for my tastes which is odd because I love anything sweet. \u00a0The curry itself didn't have as thick of a texture as I'd like. \u00a0And there was nothing unique about this curry. \u00a0It tastes like curry that you can get from any other Thai place. \u00a0Overall, we were slightly disappointed with the meal and we thought everything was okay not the greatest like everyone else points out in their reviews. \u00a0I would only go back if I had a reservation because I don't think it's worth the wait. \u00a0And I would only back to try this place out on an off hour when it's not so busy just so I can compare the drunken noodles.", "Date": "2013-07-08", "Author_Location": "Pasadena, CA"}, {"Author": "April C.", "ReviewID": "MK7kC2l4tO3f8fT5gLs_Mw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best Thai food EVER!

However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.On a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalape\u00f1o will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing! Apps..#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalape\u00f1o and sticky rice. #13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. #14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.Salads..#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. #59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.Entrees..A. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. Drunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors. Garlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us. Dessert.. We're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).At some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us.

So we settled on a cup of the Tom Yum Koong, Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles, and the Fried Garlic Prawns.Needless to say, we really enjoyed all three. The soup had just the right amount of tanginess and kick, and the cup was full of huge shrimp (oxymoron, I know).My wife had never eaten soft shell crab before, so she was a little weirded out by it here, but I really liked it and we both loved the noodles; great texture and flavor there.And I liked the prawns more and more as I ate them, but I have to say... I'm not sure how I feel about eating the shells like chips. There's definitely a certain taste to it, but I don't think I'm a fan of it just yet. I'll have to try it again.We got there fifteen minutes prior to opening on a Saturday evening, and we were seated immediately.

While I just can't proclaim this or any spot as the \"Best Thai Food\" in the US... \u00a0given that this is \"Vegas Baby\"..... Lotus of Siam is a real find. And in fact, if this operation were in a major hotel, it would probably be the star attraction... especially given my lowered opinion, over the years, of Vegas Strip restaurants.When my business associate and I arrived at Lotus this past Wednesday evening, around 6pm, I noticed the taxis dropping off clients. He noticed the \"tour bus\" stopping right in front of the restaurant, behind the taxis. His first words? \"Let's book it and get in before they unload!\" We quickly realized after entering that there are two dining rooms. It appeared busloads, and groups, are seated in the second dining room, where they're set up for larger groups. We had nothing to worry about.My thanks to Anita L., Irvine, for contributing her review to the line-up. After our first exhibit day, Wednesday, at a trade show in the Rio, I was thinking of how to follow up our Tuesday setup day. Tuesday found us \"dinnering\" at Memphis Championship BBQ in Henderson. It's one of my \"regular stops\" when in town. But for something different, I typed in \"Thai\", and at the top of the list was Lotus. Anita's one of my yelp-buds, and I respect her opinion. And with Thai cuisine, and for me, anyone who's visited or lived \"in-country\" certainly would have a \"Thai Standard.\"Following Anita's review comments about \"traditional cuisine...\", I decided to see if I could replicate my taste experiences when I lived in a Lao-Thai village in Ubon, circa late 60's. For our table of two, I ordered the papaya salad, chicken satay, soft spring rolls, sticky rice, lard na (noodles) with beef, and yellow-coconut curry with chicken. Add to that a total of four Thai iced teas. (I make them at home!) It was a very good meal. The food actually did remind me of the food I ate in Thailand. I have to say that even the wait-staff's level and type of service was typical to any nice restaurant I've ever visited in Thailand.If you're thinking \"Thai\" in town, and to join in the cheer..... I'm voting Lotus of Siam \u00a0a \"Best Bet in Vegas.\" And evidently, Louis Anderson, an entertainer who by \"form\" exhibits that he knows good food, thinks so too!

These were really good. They have a slight lemon flavor, they come with cucumber pieces in some kind of sauce that was really good. We really enjoyed this app.Meals:Crispy duck panang: so so so good. I wish it had come with more sauce, but there was enough for all of us to enjoy. The sauce was delicious and the crispy duck was perfect. This was my favorite dish!Garlic prawns: another delicious dish! \u00a0The skins are separated from the actual prawn so you can eat the prawn, then the skin. So tasty and crispy. I actually only ate one though bc I was obsessed with the duck dish.Spicy sausage (from the Northern menu, forget the Thai name): \u00a0the guys I was with wanted this. I didn't like it. They liked it but said they wished it had some kind of sauce with it. Dessert:Fried bananas: these were awesome. I was picturing just one giant banana coming out but it was 8 pieces individually wrapped in their wonton wrapper with coconut, then drizzled with honey. It was like a crispy banana, sort of tasted like banana bread too. Very good.I really wish this place was closer to home for me. \u00a0It exceeded my expectations.

In my opinion this place is very overrated. I've had much better in Seattle, California and Ithaca (believe it or not).

I may go back and order dishes off the northern menu, or make it clear I'm adventurous. Anyway, off of recommendations online and from the waiter we got the garlic prawns, crispy rice, and duck with masaman curry. The crispy rice really didn't appeal to me. It tasted overwhelmingly of ginger and even had large strips of ginger in it. A little ginger goes a long way! It also had too much lemon grass. Eating it made my mouth fatigued and overwhelmed and not in a pleasant way at all. The sausage was really not good. The flavors just weren't balanced and the texture of the rice was good but not great. The pig skins in there were very good - I wish there had been more. The garlic prawns were really not good either. the shrimp meat was overcooked, but my main complaint was the flavor. The fried shrimp shells were very interesting and the texture was pleasing, but there was just no flavor in the dish at all besides black pepper and an oily fried food taste. Some kind of dipping sauce would have been ideal, but proper seasoning might have been enough to make it good. I kept dipping it in the red curry that came with but I would've preferred something acidic or sweet. Really ANYTHING to balance out the oily taste. It was served over slaw, but that was not dressed either - it was just there to catch the excess oil. The duck dish was very good. The duck was excellent, but I don't think it paired that well with masaman curry. I would order this again with a different sauce. It was silly of me to order the curry because, c'mon, you can get that kind of curry anwhere! But the curry tasted good. It didn't blow my mind, and I would've preferred if it wasn't broken. Overall, very disappointing. It wasn't worth the stomach ache of three deep fried dished, that's for sure! Also, yes it's easy to get a taxi there but how do you get back??

Since they are LOCATED near the airport (South side of the strip). It was convenient and the timing was right.

Egg Roll/Spring Roll - yelp.com/biz_photos/lotu\u2026 I asked for Spring Roll and he said they call it egg roll here. This confused me as I always thought that Vietnamese and Thai call theirs spring rolls but he said they don't use the rice paper wrap. Didn't matter, I enjoyed it. Rice paper wrap, egg dough..whatever... it came out hot, it was crispy and had great filling. Pad Thai Noodle W/Chicken - yelp.com/biz_photos/lotu\u2026 I was very impressed with this dish. The noodles did not stick together, it was not too oily, and it had a very rich and strong peanut flavor. It also had the right amount of acidity to balance out the richness. This was one of the better pad Thai dishes that I have eaten. Panang Curry W/Beef - yelp.com/biz_photos/lotu\u2026 We normally order panang curry or yellow curry but lately we been choosing panang more than yellow. Probably because panang is richer and creamier in flavor, and that is exactly what we got with this dish. They don't give a lot but you don't need a lot since this dish is packed with flavor. \u00a0Spice levels are based on a scale of 1-10 and we got level 7. This is about as high as I would like it to go here. Any higher and it would have probably killed the taste for me. The ENVIRONMENT here was very pleasant. Although it was very crowded, we didn't feel claustrophobic because they have lots of tables and are properly spaced out. The size of this place is a pretty decent size. We were even able to bring in our stroller. The SERVICE is good. As soon as we entered our hostess took us to a table to accommodate our stroller. A huge plus in my book.

So best part about that was did I get too try everything and the kitchen sink. Believe had over ten different dishes in all so just going too pick out the ones that stood out for me.The crispy duck pagnang was very very good. The crispy duck something that could have had whole dish of by itself. It had the perfect crispy crust that crunch every time and still meat is moist. You combine it with sauce over rice. Fabulous! We had four different types of noodles from the traditional pad thai too other ones on menu gear more toward certain regional style. The pad thai was solid. Lo mein type of noodle really enjoyed because not normal one orange in color and tasty noodle. The pineapple fried rice was ok different but not something would order again. Green Papaya Salad had nice spicy kick too it. Solid choice. The winner for me was the FRIED BANANAS. Bananas wrapped in lumpia wrapping deep fried too perfect crispy brown and felt like hogging them all too myself. The location is one less then desirable part of town. It amazing never judge book by its cover. You walk into the place really small hallway too all sudden opens too restaurant hold over or close too 100 people. They had nice wine cellar that see lot of the win on the menu, It become popular cult almost they have pictures all famous people that have dined there on the walls. If run out of conversations look around guess who who on the walls. The menu is pretty massive in choices. So sure there is something there appeals too everyone.

I give this a mid to low 3 stars.b. \u00a0#14 - Nam Kao -- okay, we ordered this because of the reviews. \u00a0It is basically sliced ginger, mixed with some fried type of crouton/rice/bread (hard to pinpoint), green onions, red onions, papayas, and some other stuff. \u00a0I guess this is sort of a hit or miss. \u00a0You either like it or not. \u00a0Honestly, I was not a fan. \u00a0In fact, I thought this was the worst dish of the night. \u00a0I give this a mid 2 stars.c. \u00a0Beef salad -- this was the star of our dinner. \u00a0By far and away the best dish of the night. \u00a0If I knew, I would have ordered 2-3 of these puppies. \u00a0The beef was cooked to perfection ~ medium rare. \u00a0And, it was seasoned to perfection. \u00a0The only issue that I had was that it was very spicy (for a #2 spice level). \u00a0I must have drained 3 large glasses of water. \u00a0But, this was well worth it. \u00a0My first 5 stars.Entrees:a. \u00a0Drunken Sea Bass w/ Noodles -- okay, this dish was about 29.95. \u00a0It was a bit pricey; however, based on the review, we had to try it. \u00a0And, quite frankly, this was a very good dish. \u00a0The Sea Bass was soft, tender, and flaky. \u00a0And, the right mixture of sweetness and season was mixed in with the noodles. But, I did not think this should have been a $29.95 dish. \u00a0It is a bit steep. \u00a0For this, I grade it as a low 4-4.25 stars.b. \u00a0Fried Prawns -- this was by far the most original dish. \u00a0They basically take these jumbo sized shrimp (think size 10-15) and peel the skin back. \u00a0Best way to explain this is to think of a horizontal line. \u00a0On one end of the shrimp is the shrimp meat and on the other is the peeled shell side. \u00a0They marinate the whole shebang in some salty sauce and deep fry it. \u00a0What you get is a fried shrimp with the shell attached. \u00a0You eat both the meat and the shell. \u00a0It was quite tasty. \u00a0However, I have to say that I wished they had a dip for this - something tangy would be a nice fit .. i.e. sweet and sour would do. \u00a0For originality and taste, I give them a high 4 stars or low 5 stars.Desserts:a. \u00a0Fried Banana - \u00a0If I had to do it again, I would not order this. \u00a0It was okay.... also, we were a bit too full to eat this -- doggy bag time. \u00a02-3 stars.\\b. \u00a0Sweet Rice with Mangos -- this was not too original. \u00a0I was not into the rice; however, I have to admit that the mangos were very sweet. \u00a0I give this a mid 3-star rating for the mangos.Overall, this was a pretty cool experience. \u00a0The service was excellent. \u00a0We had some dishes that were okay, but we also had some amazing and original dishes as well. \u00a0Dinner total for 3 (no drinks - except water) totaled to 106 dollars. \u00a0With tip, it added up to $125 in all. \u00a03 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts -- hmm, not a bad price at all! \u00a0I would give this a solid 4 with room to move up to 5 star status...BTW, as we walked out around 7pm, the whole restaurant was packed and the parking lot was filled with Lotus of Siam patrons.We definitely would be back. \u00a0And, we look forward to trying other dishes.Cheers!!!", "Date": "2013-03-01", "Author_Location": "Henderson, NV"}, {"Author": "Dennis C.", "ReviewID": "duB1bxQZ3QxU2JgCHKcewA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tom yum goong, pad kapow gai with a fried egg, \u00a0and sai oua.

The Tom Kha soup was ok but nothing special. 6 or 7 egg rolls would be brought out then vanish leaving an empty tray. The garlic wings looked like something left too long under the heat lamps, and then I had the Chili Mint Chicken with excessive squash or whatever the heck it was. I never thought a Thai place could massacre a dish such as Chili Mint Chicken but LOS has found a way to do it. To call this a \"buffet\" is doing the word a great disservice. I'm not expecting a spread the size of the Bacchanal buffet, but this...this is freakin ridiculous with what they're trying to pass off as a lunch buffet. Seriously for the price and especially on quality and taste Komol across the parking lot kicks LOS's derriere. If you think this is the best Thai food found in Vegas, you seriously need to pull out your Yelp app on your phone and do a little exploring.

It didn't seem very authentic to me, nor was the food as good as people say. This is not the kind of Thai food I grew up eating, and my family is from Thailand and Laos. We got 6 dishes which we were to share amongst each other. Specifically: Chicken Kao Soi, the Crispy Duck in Chili Mint Leaves, Beef Pad See-ew, Spicy Chicken Wings, Papaya Salad, and Pork Larb. We started out with the Papaya Salad and Larb. Holy crap, were the portions tiny. I make papaya salad and also cucumber salad (same concept but with cucumber) every week, at home, in huge portions and it's a very inexpensive dish to make. There's no reason why it was served in such a small portion and at that price. It does come with sticky rice, but still, more would've been nice. Especially between 6 people. The Larb was tiny too. Each of us had a tbsp full on our plates. lol. It was cute, but also quite sad. Both dishes were gross to me, personally. Since when do you put sesame oil in either of those dishes? It must be a regional thing. I don't know. Either way, it was gross. I don't make it that way, nor do any of my family or friends whom are from Thailand and Laos. The Papaya salad had very unbalanced flavors too, which is Papaya salad blasphemy. It tasted sweet and spicy, but no salt or tartness. Weird. The Larb would have been ok if it wasn't drenched in sesame oil. I liked the spices, which were different, but good. The Entrees were also very tiny and mediocre. For a place with so much hype, I expected to be amazed. I wasn't. At least with most of the entrees. I didn't actually get to eat the duck or chicken wings, but I heard they were fantastic. My brother is a piggy, so he ate most of it. I pretty much sacrificed my food so everyone else could eat. Needless to say, I went to bed hungry that night. :(As for the service, it was ok.

Long story short, I wouldn't recommend this place for lunch or for the buffet because not only was the food meh but the service was horrendous.When we got there, the host asked how many were in our party to be seated. We told them that our friends were already here and asked if they minded if we took a quick peek around the corner to see if they were seated already. The host said no problem and we walked past him. After looking for about 5-10 seconds, he walks back in front of us and says \"maybe they're not here yet\", as if to call us liars and try to seat us anyways. We walked back towards to entrance to call our friends to see where they were. The host follows us around the whole time as if we're not allowed to walk freely in the lobby. He continued to challenge us even after I told him nicely that our friends had texted us that they were seated somewhere inside before we even walked in. We eventually found our party, which had been seated towards the back. We ignored the host and just made our way towards them. After being seated it was impossible to get someone to stop at our table to ask questions about the buffet and menu. I thought about ordering off the menu,but my group wanted to go for the buffet, so I thought why not? Once we started eating, the only time we saw a server was when we needed refills on water and soda. No one ever stopped by to ask us how we were doing or took our plates. I even grabbed some plates and threw them on an empty bar where nobody was sitting because they were piling up. I also had to get up and grab my own sauces and napkins from the waiters' supply corner...no customer service whatsoever, but this is an Asian restaurant so who knows if they even care. There was also not very many people there for the noon lunch hour compared to what you would expect when experiencing a lapse in service. Maybe 2/3 of the restaurant was full if even. Had the restaurant been completely full, I would've taken that into account. There was also some confusion when we were paying our bill so it seems like the hostess' don't know what they're doing either.The buffet featured items such as chow mein, pad thai, garlic wings, mint chicken and other typical buffet foods. The selection was small as there were only 2 tables worth of food. Most of the food was bland (pad thai especially) and some of the fried items were 90% dough and not much filler (egg rolls, fried banana are examples). The only thing that I really ate more than a couple bites of was the chow mein and garlic wings...show I really just filled up on wings. Not really what you would expect at a Thai restaurant.While I was eating, I was already thinking about how I was going to word this review because I was unhappy the entire meal. Keeping in mind that it was only the buffet that we had, makes me want to go back and try ordering items from their menu. However, the service was a real turn off and I've had better service at fast food joints than what I had today at Lotus. I doubt we'd be back in the future.

If you go for the same old stuff that everywhere else has, then that's what you're gona get... the same 'ol boring stuff. Try something different!Get the Nam Kao Tod! It's crispy puffy rice sauteed with sour sausage. It sounds a little weird, but it's delicious! I love the crispy texture and there's tons of tangy flavor from the sausage and citrus they put in it. Watch out for the heat though! It might not seem that spicy at first, but the spice creeps up on you and lingers!The drunken noodles with soft shell crab was SO GOOD. The sauce for the noodles is on the sweeter side. It's a nice compliment to the salty, crunchy soft shell crab. Don't forget to eat some of the deep fried basil leaves with it!But the most amaaazing thing was their mango and sticky rice! HANDS DOWN the BEST mango and sticky rice I've ever had! The mango was perfectly ripe and so sweet. The sticky rice was unique with the hint of floral in the background. And I couldn't get enough of their coconut milk!This is also a great place for you wine lovers! Their wine ROOM is astonishing. They have a whole binder as their wine list.

But such a place does exist my friends. It's called Lotus of Siam - known to many as the best Thai restaurant in America for over a decade, and home to the culinary masterpieces of multiple-time nominee and 2011 James Beard award-winning chef Saipin Chutima. I first went to Lotus on my first trip to Vegas in 2008, after hearing continuous raves from my close friend and Yelper Jay F. They were already starting to get a buzz then, with one magazine proclaiming them the best Thai restaurant in America, and it's been great to see how the buzz has grown to Beard Awards and feature episodes on Top Chef Masters. A couple of weeks back was my first trip there in about four years, and it was nice to see that the restaurant has been expanded and renovated inside to better reflect it's reputation and quality cuisine. My friend and I arrived at close to 9PM on a Monday night. They close at 9:30, but true to Lotus form, they were PACKED and more were flocking in. We took a seat at the nice bar (new since I last visited) and was pleased to see a small but thoughtful selection of bottled beer (many people were enjoying Stone IPA) and a selection of sake. (Wine is the thing to come here for - they have an impressive selection and showcase their wine storage room prominently - but I'm just not a wine person.) Shortly after ordering and receiving my hot sake, we were called for our table. We started with 2 apps - the Issan Style Beef Jerky (13a) and Nam Ko Tod (14), which is essentially a crispy rice salad served with minced sour pork sausage and unlike anything I have ever had. Amazing. As always, we ordered both a 10 spicy, but felt these were a little lower - maybe a 7 in \"Lotus Spice\", which is equal to the \"10\" at most other places. For my entree, I decided to bypass the \"go to\" dishes I had tried in the past and went with a traditional Massaman curry. And that's the great thing about Lotus - they have a huge menu with some truly creative and unique offerings that will blow you away. But for the less adventurous, they offer the same traditional Thai dishes that you can get at any neighborhood Thai restaurant, and at the same price. The difference is that it is prepared by a highly decorated chef, and it will be the best version of the traditional Thai dish you have ever had. I'll put my neighborhood Thai restaurant in Manassas up against any Thai restaurant in America - except Lotus. This was, hands down, the best Massaman curry I have ever had. And this time, the 10 spicy was indeed a 10 ... several pitchers of water were needed. (And you certainly are reminded the day after that you indeed did order the \"10\")If there is any issue with Lotus, it's that the service can be a little bit hit or miss. There was some confusion with the server, and my friend was served the wrong entree. However, after pointing this out, our server went back to the kitchen and produced the proper entree in minutes ... and it was spot on. They make mistakes, but they handle them properly and professionally. Lotus isn't just the best Thai in Vegas ... it's the best Thai in America, the best restaurant in Vegas, and one of the best restaurants in America. All at prices that are no more expensive than your typical Thai restaurant. Any foodie that's been to Vegas and hasn't been to Lotus can't call themselves a foodie or say they've really been to Vegas.

I have eaten Thai food in so many places and food at LoS is so much better in term of taste, \u00a0flavors, spices, and quality. When I slurped the soup, I could tell the sweetness and flavor came from bones/meat \u00a0being stewed for hours, and NOT from loads of MSG many other places threw in to mask the sweetness. They seasoned the food so nicely that your tongue can taste the sourness, sweetness, spiciness and all other flavors at the same time without one overtaking others. The quality is always so fresh. \u00a0Food cooked here are truly being made with care and fitted for royalty. - This restaurant used to be hole in the wall kind of restaurant but since expanded out and lookw much nicer inside. This restaurant is also located in a kinda shading commercial center that you normally would not visit if you're familiar with that area. But guess what? \u00a0This restaurant is packed every night and you wouldn't believe how many people took taxi and limousines all the way from the strip to dine at this place.

Crab Salad - crab was battered and deep fried but it was not melt in your mouth, perfectly soft yet crunchy as a good crab salad should be. The accompanying vegetables were perfect and a beautiful combination. It saved this dish.4. Sweet and sour chicken (for my kids) - Awful. Sauce was too sweet, pineapples looked like they were canned, white meat chicken were morsels not slices. Disaster.5. Red Tofu Curry - Flavor was again just OK, not amazing. We've had much better.6.

I can't believe we didn't try this place out sooner!! Service was so-so..but the food was great!What we ordered:- spicy chicken wings: DEEEELLISH! I think this was my bf's favorite. If you are in the mood for fried chicken wings, order this! It's fried wings covered in a sweet & spicy sauce so it's a bit sticky. These little things were just addicting and we loved every bite.- drunken noodles w/ seafood: yummy while it's hot! The first bite was amazing. I haven't had drunken noodles this good in awhile. It's more saucy than I'm used to but the flavor was all there. They didn't skimp out on the seafood either. Mussles, shrimp, scallop, & imitation crab [disappointed in the imitation crab but that's ok]. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the noodles stuck together after awhile so it got clumpy. Flavors were still good so I accepted it lol. - braised short rib w/ panang: this was interesting. Decided to order it because of its popularity among yelp reviews. On the pricey side [~$17].. but it's braised short rib so I get it. I don't know if this is the best combination for my taste buds but I can see it growing on me. It's still good don't get me wrong and I might order it again. I think I would have liked it if the short rib was more moist..I think it was more on the drier side which is why I can't give it a glowing review. Maybe it was an off day..but that's just what I thought about it. I will absolutely come back the next time I'm in vegas.

They DO have a fantastic wine selection: the \"cellar\" is housed behind a thick glass wall, so all can see the abundant wine offerings. \u00a0The papaya salad was deceptively simple, yet very complex in flavors - a joy for the palate. \u00a0The squid salad was fabulously delicious, but extremely spicy: enjoy, but beware!

None to be had. \u00a0How disappointing.Overall, this dining experience was a three out of four: the service felt rushed, and yet my first dish clearly sat for a long time before being served; the restaurant is extremely noisy - quite difficult to carry on a conversation at regular decibel level; lack of staple Thai dessert was very disappointing; and the seating arrangements leave a lot to be desired - at least for me.", "Date": "2012-12-19", "Author_Location": "Churchville, PA"}, {"Author": "Miss A.", "ReviewID": "DqFXjSGhhCR5SNNNWD0ZqQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Definitely a hidden treasure!

Mouth watering goodness and def. a must order!Deep Fried Sea Bass - $28.95 - very good but in my opinion, pretty small for the price. It's deep fried in some kind of a chili sauce.I highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back.

Every card-carrying foodie from San Diego to Buffalo knows the lore of the Thai restaurant with the chef who catered to a king, or something like that. Cab rides to this Commercial Center restaurant are probably second only to cab rides to [insert most popular strip club]. (Despite my name, I don't know the strip circuit scene.)There is a lot of hype, which perhaps make it easy to disappoint, but at the same time it is an off-the-beaten-path hole-in-the-wall, which makes it easy for folks to think they have discovered Mecca. I had waited to write a review because I had only been there once four years ago, and I felt that I needed to give LOS another try. The first time I went I strayed from my usual Thai curries and ordered some Northern Thai specialties. I was disappointed. I thought it was overpriced and undergood.Last night, I went back for a second tasting, and I ordered curries. The red and massaman curries were good, solid Thai, but the portions were a bit small, and the vegetable selection included baby corn-- a pet peeve. Plus, they do not have one single grain of brown rice. They underwent a mysterious renovation, which somehow involved more tan paint and a wall in the middle of the dining area, but that is just a side note.I am really torn because I find it hard to contradict years of sentiment and foodie dogma, and I am thinking that perhaps the true gems of LOS are specialty items that I have yet to order. When it comes to Thai, I am so happy with my curries and rice, I never want a specialty item, so for me, it would not be worth a 45-minute wait or an expensive cab ride, but the other day when we were dining next door, we met a man from NY who has the food Fed Ex'd to his house, so there has to be something there.

Light crispy skin with honey garlic spicy sauce. Wow. This dish was good. You get about 7-8 wings per order.NAM KAO TOD - The crispy rice and sour sausage dish was very very tasty. Lots of flavors attacking the pallet at the same time. We got a medium spicy and we felt it. The spiciness was gradually getting hotter and hotter with each bite. If you only took one bite, you'd be fine. But seriously, how can you stop after only one bite?TOM YUM KUNG - Hot and sour with shrimp, lime juice, lemon grass, and straw mushroom. Tasty but I dont think I would order this again with so many other soup choices on the menu.GARLIC PRAWN - Amazing. The skin was soooo crispy, you could eat the prawn whole with skin and everything. One friend kept on eating just the skin! The prawns were huge. Normally, the medium size shrimp go about 40/45 pieces per pound. I bet these would be like 20 pieces a pound.CRISPY DUCK with PANANG - I think this was the best dish of the night. Wow. The duck skin was definitely crispy. There were good chunks of meat under the skin as well. Definitely more than I expected. And that alone is mouth watering, but then add the Panang (Curry) and it was perfect. I would definitely without a doubt order this again.SEA BASS OVER DRUNKEN NOODLES - The sea bass filets were seared just right and the thick (chow fun) noodles underneath were scrumptious as well. I was delightfully surprised about the large serving size.All this food with some Thai Iced Teas and we were happy campers. Needless to say, I redeemed myself with a good pick and the party definitely had a good meal.

The beef was very juicy, a different cut from the garlic beef. This dish was a little more spicy but I loved it. After eating all the noodles we added the rice to mix with the curry sauce.

The coconut ice cream was very refreshing with small chunks of coconut. The fried bananas were good too, not too sweet.Including 2 beers and 2 Thai ice teas, tax and tip the bill was slightly over $100, I thought that was pretty pricey for Thai food.

Marinated prawns wrapped with bacon and rice paper crepe, deep fried, served with sweet and sour sauce.2.STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS-Good. Chicken wings stuffed with ground pork deep fried, served with sweet & sour sauce. Without the sauce, the chicken was dry. With the sauce, Great!3.NAM KAO TOD-Awesome! Minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice. We got this dish at a 7 heat level and it went beautifully with our wine selection!For my entree i ordered the GINGER FISH(refer to pic) which is a deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with ginger accompanied by a black mushroom sauce. This dish was really good. I stuck with a 4 heat level just to be cautious, and it definitely could have used more heat. The skin was perfectly cooked. With each bite of delicate flesh there was an even better crunch. The mushrooms added a nice earthiness to the dish which gave a great balance.One of my colleagues ordered the SWEET & SOUR FISH(refer to pic) which is a deep fried whole pompano fish, topped with Thai style sweet and sour sauce. which he had no complaints about. Everybody at the table seemed to enjoy everything... all except my general manager. For his entree he ordered DUCK with some sort or mint and ginger(from what i can remember). Not only did it come out after all of our entree's, but it was cold. Now we had a situation where no one wanted to eat until everybody had their food. The person that didn't have their food was, of course, one of the people paying. HORRIBLE FEELING! He finally got his food, and it didn't seem like he was enjoying any of his meal after that.

How have I never written a review for Lotus?This is, without question, my absolute favorite restaurant in the world. If I'm ever on death row, this is my last meal. If I ever moved away from Vegas, Lotus is probably what i would miss the most. I have been eating there about twice a month for the five years I've been living in Vegas. On her third or fourth nomination, chef Saipin Chutima won the James Beard Award this year - but the secret has long been out about this amazing, otherworldly culinary experience 3/4 of a mile and worlds away from the Strip.Almost everything I have ever eaten here is absolutely fantastic, and for spice junkies like myself it's a legitimate challenge. They operate on a 1-10 scale, but there's actually a spice level 15. I don't recommend it. But if you like some serious heat to your food, a 10 will kick your ass. The 15 is just unnecessary.As for the dishes, almost all that I've ever had are fantastic. Here are my recommendations from the gargantuan, 150+ item menu:11. Garlic Pepper Chicken Wings. These are bursting with flavor from the fried garlic and the green onions that practically drip off the crispy wings. I'm not really much of a wing person but I can go to town on these.13. Nua Dad Deaw. This Issan style beef jerky is, in flavor and texture, completely different than any jerky you've ever had.14. Nam Kao Tod. The BEST DISH EVER, and I mean ever. I order this every single time I go. It's a sour sausage salad over crispy rice with a complex and vibrant flavor profile that includes the always distinct and recognizable tastes of green and red onions, peanuts, ginger, mint, cilantro, lime, basil and chili. Seriously, I've never seen this offered anywhere else and it's unlike any other food on earth. You've never seen so many flavors, colors and textures all in the same dish.55. Nua Nam Tok. Charbroiled beef on a flavorful and tangy mix of lime, rice powder and green onion.59. Koi Soy. This Issan style steak tartare is unbelievably good. The rice powder makes for an incredible texture contrast with the beef, and the lime and chili mix almost cooks the beef the way that the citric acid in a ceviche cooks the fish. This one gets really intense when you turn the spice level up on it.66. Issan Sausage. Let me tell you a little story about their Issan sausage, cured for weeks in-house with a mixture of pork, wine, garlic and spices. They ran out of it for a period of a few weeks a few summers back, and they were the longest weeks of my life. I craved it like a crack baby. It's a dry, sour sausage that's paired with ginger, peanuts, fresh chilis and red onions. This is probably about my 2nd most common entree order. Be sure to get some rice to mix it with, and wrap it up in a cabbage leaf. That's how it's eaten when served off street carts in Thailand.72. Mint and Green Chili. Heat of spice countered by cool mint. I daydream about this sometimes.79. Pepper Garlic Sauce. Emphasis on the garlic. Lots of green onions on this one too, that combination seems to work well.102. Pad Thai. I've never had a better version of this dish, which all too often tastes too much of tamarind. But this is a subtle blend of the dish's strong flavors. Never had better.107. Kai Koowah. Like a more flavorful, less salty chow fun.121. Spicy Fried Rice. I feel like a gringo because I order the spicy fried rice more than any other entree. But it is simply a flavorful delivery system for some of the most intensely flavorful but not overwhelming heat in the whole desert. (I always order this level 10 spicy. I don't F around.) The garlic, basil, and fresh chilis add a bolt of lightning to a savory bowl of fried rice. Again, the best of its kind.H. Nam Prik Noom. This green chili dip is the perfect choice for when you just want something light.Those are my go-tos on the Lotus menu, depending on my mood. There's a couple other things that need to be said about Lotus.The wine list is mind-boggling and affordable. It's a special treat for lovers of German and Austrian Rieslings.The lunch buffet should be skipped. If you get it, you're missing out on most of the things that make Lotus such a special dining destination. Although I would be lying if I said I had never had the lunch buffet and piled on plate after plate after plate of garlic chicken wings and the world's best pad thai. But I'm there twice a month or more, that's a luxury I have that most Lotus visitors don't.If you only eat one meal in Vegas, make this it.", "Date": "2011-05-31", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Angie I.", "ReviewID": "F0S33UXCjFmbVjvXsj9ugQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This restaurant is a little out of the way but I'm glad that we found it. \u00a0The most important thing to know is that you should call ahead for a reservation! \u00a0The dining room is very large and seats many tables but there are so many people that come here that the wait for dinner was really long. \u00a0The second thing to know is that their wine list has hundreds of wines by the bottle \u00a0Hopefully you're not indecisive!Another interesting things was that the bathroom was in a prime spot of the wait staff to carry food and only had 1 stall even though the restaurant is one of the largest ones I have ever been to. \u00a0The waiters did a pretty good job of attending to the tables even though there were so many people.There were plenty of options and we liked everything that we tried. \u00a0i would definitely come here again but only if I call ahead!", "Date": "2013-01-26", "Author_Location": "Redwood City, CA"}, {"Author": "Mike C.", "ReviewID": "t7Rs5GfR8CwRtK_ZfybpJg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What haven't LOS been yelped about?? \u00a0Everything for the most part is true. \u00a0This place is, in street term, \"proper!\" \u00a0Yea, I'm hood like that.I love watching the expression of my friends' faces when they take their first bite of the Braised Short Ribs with Panang. \u00a0Their eyes always light up, and to me that's enough because I'd like to think they're saying, \"Thank you.\" \u00a0LOS knows how to do curry really well. \u00a0I still think it's kind of weird that their The Crispy Duck with Chu-Chee and Panang taste the same to me. \u00a0I tried them side by side too.

The Panang sauce was delicious and the crispy duck was even better.

But for those of us who get to Vegas a couple times a year, the visit to Lotus of Siam must be meticulously planned.* Time your attack. If you're in town for a major convention you have to get there VERY early or else make reservations well in advance for a large party, otherwise you will wait 90 minutes or more. (If you want to call ahead, note that when the restaurant is closed, up till 5 pm, they simply don't answer the phone.)* Be sure your hotel room has microwave and refrigerator. That way you can order with abandon and know you can take the leftovers to enjoy another day.* When they ask you \"how spicy\" tell them no more than a 5 or 6 or you truly will have your taste buds blown away. I say this as someone who regularly puts Tabasco in many dishes at home.* Take time to study the enormous menu (grab one while you're waiting for a table}, or just throw yourself on the mercy of your server after telling them you want the northern/Issan dishes. You will note that many of the salad-y dishes have common ingredients of chili and lime and red onion. Don't get more than one or two of these unless you are at a big table sharing because the flavors will be too close together and the chilis will blow you away for the rest of the meal. Likewise, the finely chopped Issan dishes are complex and subtle but they are close enough in flavor that they should be enjoyed on subsequent visits, not on the same night. (Unless, again, you are a large party and can order a few of these to share and sample.)* If you're there at lunch, resist the temptation to just get the inexpensive buffet. It's totally different stuff.* Pace yourself and use discipline when tasting among the different dishes. The food arrives when it is ready; the kitchen seems to have no interest in giving you a soup first, then a salad, then a more substantial dish with rice. If you want your meal organized this way, you'll have to do it yourself. If I am by myself, here's the strategy I will use for my next several visits as I order my way through the menu.* Start with a soup. Most of these are Thai standards but the kitchen is so good with different ingredients I would expect them to be great renditions. Anyway, you can't go wrong with the Northern Style Thom Kha Gai (item M on the Northern menu): amazingly light, fresh tasting, spicy and redolent of lemon grass, a perfect food I could gulp by the quart.* Now a northern/Issan specialty--or two or more, if you're sharing. Have this before the salad because the flavors are subtle. Some favorites are Nam Kao Tod (crispy rice with very finely chopped sausage) and Kang Hung Lay (garlicky northern pork stew, a smallish portion). This last visit I had #61 Hok Mok Plar, catfish \"in a hok mok chili sauce\" which is like a curry, but eggy--strange and wonderful.* Now a Thai salad, which you've resisted or just nibbled at because of the chili factor. On your first visit, the choice is simple: crispy catfish salad. It's like a good green papaya salad, but with amazing bits of fish. My last visit I had #14 Larb Koong and was very pleased. Catfish again, but finely chopped, marinated and folded into crispy rice.* At this point you have spent a lot of money and you probably aren't particularly full, so I would pad my menu with a curry served with rice. My last visit I tried Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngyow (#G on the northern menu, rice vermicelli curry) and was disappointed--oily and not a lot of flavor. Next time I'll try a standard Panang or red or green curry which will also bring my per-item average cost down. * Dessert? I am generally too sated when I get to this point but if you want dessert the mango with sticky rice is a delightful and popular choice.* Don't be shy about asking the kitchen to pack the uneaten bits to go--they expect this. They get a lot of takeout orders from people who are taking the food on the plane, or get frustrated at a 2 hour wait for a table.

What do I mean? Well, it had the misfortune of 1) being the dinner we ate AFTER having gone to Jose Andres' e' and 2) being visited a few months AFTER the wife and I had eaten in Portland's Pok Pok.If it weren't for those two things, this would've been a five star review all the way. But alas, it wasn't the best meal I'd eaten in 24 hours (though, yes, an unfair comparison) let alone the best Thai I'd had (by which I mean the aforementioned Pok Pok.)So let me stop the comparisons and just talk about our experience. It's in a strip mall--a sketch strip mall at that. Some (my overly critical parents, for example) might find that a turn off. Others (a-hole Yelpers like me for example) add points given a genuine hole-in-the-wall status. Thankfully, the sketch doesn't extend to the interior.We had a group of six. We'd made reservations about a month previous so we had few (if any) hiccups (though we did heed the advice of showing up exactly on time.) The wine list was impressive by hole-in-the-wall Thai joint standards. Actually, it wasn't bad from an objective standpoint either. We'd ordered a few bottles of Reisling, letting the sweetness of the wine counter the spiciness of the food and allowing each diner to bathe in the unfettered air of foodie douchebaggery.I ordered the BBQ Pork (Moo Yang). It was tasty and I was pretty pleased with it, though it was kind of one-note. Also, it reminded me of the pork I'd eaten at Tu Lan's, a shady Vietnamese place in SF. Now that's not a bad comparison since I LOVED that pork, but I'd expected something a bit more...Thai.My wife ordered a green curry dish. She said it was \"okay,\" and indeed, my sampling of it concurred. She groused, though. \"From the reputation of this place, I was expecting to be blown away.\" Yeah, I guess so. Then again, some places shine with their unexpected dishes--their specials and such--while phoning it in on the same ol', same ol'. I guess this could be one of those places. In fact, I hope so. It's really hard to tell since the majority of our group went the \"5 different varieties of curry\" route and they too were mildly disappointed.Sigh.The service was good and friendly. My pork was tasty. The wine flowed easily. But most of my group were perplexed and questioned the LoS's reputation. I don't know, man. Why didn't you guys order the whole fish if you wanted to see what they can do?As you can see, I'm a bit torn. I'll give LoS the benefit of the doubt and grant them four stars at least.

I guess I went to Lotus of Siam expecting something magnificent, to only be disappointed by a dinner of mediocrity. Having heard about Lotus of Siam and read the numerous glowing reviews on the internet, I had thought that we were going to be experiencing an orgasmic meal of mammoth proportions. Some of the reviews had proclaimed that Lotus of Siam was the best Thai restaurant on the West Coast. But I beg to differ. The food was mildly good. The restaurant itself was very bland, shoved away in a bleak strip mall in the dark corners of Las Vegas. Walking up to the restaurant, we had high expectations, but those were soured when we entered. The walls were overflowing with numerous accolades and yellowing newspaper clippings declaring the success and importance of the restaurant. OK so that was a good sign. Contrary to the restaurant's proclamation that there were no open seats, the supposed \"packed\" restaurant was dotted with a few parties and looked quite spare.So we sat down in a booth towards the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen and ordered a few bottles of sake. After being provided with our small bottles of sake and menus, we began ordering. A lady came by our table, the owner I guess, and tried to push a fried fish on us stating that we would like it. In fact, most of the night the servers tried telling us what we would like and not like suspecting us to be \"virgin\" Thai food eaters. The food came out in a somewhat fast progression, coupled with more bottles of sake. By that time we were feeling a wee bit of the sake, but the food kept us in reality as it did not conjure orgasmic feelings. In fact the food itself was quite unsettling, with very little flavor. By that time the owner had tried pushing the fried fish on us four times, we still did not budge. Leaving Lotus of Siam, we realized how spoiled we had become.

Other servers would approach us and think we were waiting for the check when we were actually waiting for the rest of our food.As for the food here, the menu is practically endless. You'll find all your typical dishes you would find in any Thai restaurant, there's some pricey specialties aka chef's recommendations at the back of the menu. However, I think there best deal are their authentic and different Thai regional dishes. Growing up eating Thai food practically everyday, I stayed clear from all your everyday Pad Thais and of the sort.We started off with the Tom Yum Pla Dook aka Tom Yum catfish soup. I had all my dishes made with three stars (1-10 spiciness star rating) just to keep it safe. Three stars wasn't spicy, a tingling feel but it won't make your toes curl yet. You can always add more chili if you ask for the condiments. Great soup starter and perfect hangover remedy. Tanginess and some spiciness is ideal after a night of boozing.Nam Khoa Tod - appetizer style dish where they fry the rice along with some other herbal type ingredients. Another authentic Thai dish that many restaurant choose not not to carry (don't ask why I don't know). Overall not too shabby, I'd order it again.Moo Yaang aka marinated grilled pork. It's really hard to mess this one up. The sauce that accompanies this dish could've used some help though. I'm use to a stronger sauce taste and it was a little bland for my taste buds. BTW, sticky rice (extra $2) is great with this dish but I think they give you a bowl of steam rice instead.Neua Naam Thok, direct translation: beef waterfall.

And you know what? It's not just them that recommend this place because famous chefs such as Jonathan Gold and Susan Feniger rave about this place as well. It's no wonder that they have been nominated for the James Beard award again and again. Just remember though that because this place is so good, you may want to call ahead and make a reservation unless you want to wait 45 minutes to an hour. Despite the swanky acclaim, let me warn you that the restaurant is way off the Strip and from the outside it looks like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. In fact, Lotus of Siam is in the original Asian enclave of Las Vegas off of East Sahara Avenue near downtown so don't expect it to be glittery nice like the new Chinatown along Spring Mountain Road. Regardless, I like being in this rundown part of town because it reminds me of the old Las Vegas before all the dazzling excess when the best hotel in town was the Dunes. \u00a0Lotus of Siam is a Thai restaurant, but its real specialty is Isan-style food. Isan is a region of Thailand that is located in the northeast portion of the country and is bordered by Cambodia and Laos. If only I had known when I was in Thailand because Isan-style cuisine is fucking delicious! Unlike traditional Thai food that people are probably accustomed to which is more sour and sweet, Isan-style cooking is more garlicky and spicy. The only way to describe the uniqueness of Isan-style Thai food is to compare it to the Peranakan \"nyonya\" cuisine \u00a0of Malaysia/Singapore due to its blending of traditional Thai flavors with Cambodian and Laotian influences and to the Korean food from Cholla Province, due to its spicier and more pungent flavors.So on Christmas Eve, our party of four ordered five dishes because the portions are a bit smaller than your normal Thai restaurant. We ended up ordering the standard noodle dishes of chicken pad thai and beef pad see ew as well as a really tangy papaya salad. I literally wanted to drink the papaya salad marinade because it was so fucking good. For the proteins we ordered moo yang (marinated charbroiled pork) and nua yum katiem (charbroiled beef marinated with garlic and hot sauce that is served on top of Thai cole claw). All the dishes were tasty, but my favorite was the Isan-style nua yum katiem. The beef had just the right amount of spicy flavors and mixed with the cole slaw, the combination was so good that I ended up drowning my rice in the sauce. At the end of the day, Lotus of Siam shines because it offers Isan-style Thai food. If you come here ordering just the normal Thai dishes, you may not enjoy this place for what it truly is.

She immediately pointed me in the direction of Lotus of Siam. She said it was an amazing Thai place and that if we had a car we should definitely check it out. I followed her advice and was so happy I did! My husband, who isn't the hugest fan of Thai, and I both enjoyed the meal we had. We ordered more than we could eat (and without having a fridge in our hotel room, we couldn't take any leftovers with us) and we were both very satisfied with our choices.I will say that I was at first very intimated by the menu. It's more than 10-pages long with a list of your standard curries, in addition to the numerous traditional dishes, plus dishes from different regions of Thailand, add to that a page or more of noodle dishes, salads, appetizers, etc.. - It is enormous! It took us a while, but we finally decided on 3 dishes we had never tried before: Spicy Shrimp Salad, Catfish red curry (without coconut milk), and a Thai-style sausage. We also ordered Pad Thai as sort of a \"control\" dish (something we're both familiar with). They have an huge (and rather impressive) wine list, but neither of us really think about pairing Thai with wine, so we stuck with beer (Singha) instead. First, the sausage was delicious. It was a country-style sausage, with big pieces of meat and fat in natural casing, simply seared and served with spears of fresh ginger, a few tiny (but VERY spicy) chili peppers, fresh cabbage, and toasted peanuts. Both of us were really taken by surprised at how flavorful the sausage was. There was a tart/sour almost citrus-y taste to the meat, like it had been pickled or brined before being chopped/ground and stuffed into its casing. This actually allowed the sausage to taste less dense than it was (it was a dry sausage, more meat than fat, and the citrus or whatever sour note cut through the meat). Taking a bite of the fresh ginger with a slice of sausage made for a perfect combo. This was, overall, our favorite dish.The catfish curry was very good, although it was similar to other red curries I've tried. I had never had curry with catfish and the fish was fresh and nicely cooked (not under-cooked and certainly not overcooked). Unfortunately, the zucchini was rather mushy, even though the green beans were al dente. It had a nice heat and the flavor was there. Honestly, this was just OK compared to everything else.The Spicy Shrimp Salad was surprisingly good and spicy. The shrimp were just this side of cooked, so still a little soft but completely cooked through, and they were huge. They were tossed with a chunky salad dressing of kaffir leaf, fish sauce, soy sauce, basil, chili peppers and probably some tamarind, plus a number of other things I couldn't quite pick out. This was all presented on a bed of roughly chopped Romaine lettuce. I could've done with smaller pieces of lettuce, as they were huge and rib-y compared to the shrimp and dressing. Ultimately, it was very good and something I would have never thought to order. I wish it was served earlier than the other dishes, more like a salad/appetizer course, rather than the last thing brought to the table.Lastly, our \"control\" dish of the Pad Thai was a welcome comfort. It was actually the best Pad Thai I've ever had before. The balance of savory, sweet, sour, and salty was perfect. The noodles were cooked well and the add-ins of sprouts, chicken, and peppers were all nicely incorporated. There was a depth of flavor in their Pad Thai that really made the dish stand out from the rest and I really wish I had more room in my stomach to eat more of it.The price for each of our dishes was comparable to other Thai restaurants at home. I'm surprised at the number of comments by other Yelpers about the portion size. I thought the portions were all easily shared by two people, possibly three. Believe me, neither my husband nor I starved that night! The service was fine, not stellar, but we certainly were not ignored or forgotten, despite being seated in the small room just off the main dining room. The decor was shabby, yes, and it definitely could use some TLC. It's at least clean. Situated in a run-down strip mall a few blocks from Las Vegas Blvd., it's as opposite of The Strip as it can be, but the food, I would say, is up there on the same level with the $50/plate restaurants in the resorts.

The tamarind sauce I could not make out the tamarind taste it tasted more like maple syrup, which I know they added to help sweetened the sourness of the tamarind.We next had the Pad Thai.

I guess it's hard to live up to the \"BEST THAI RESTAURANT IN NORTH AMERICA\" billing. That creates some pretty unrealistic expectations. Still ... The place has a great vibe -- kinda like eating in someone's home. I would suggest that, unlike us, try going when they are not in the middle of their lunch buffet. Even though we ordered off the menu, I think the kitchen struggled to get out of their all-you-can-eat mindset. The BEEF JERKY ISSAN STYLE (#13A) was an adventure. Nice as a diner to try something this unfamiliar. Had really interesting flavors but before the beef was jerked the silver skin (tough and bitter) was not trimmed properly (or at all) and some of the bites were chewy in an unpleasant way. The NAM KAO TOD (#14 Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage) was really amazing. If you like that essential Thai taste of lime, powdered-toasted rice and fish sauce, make a point of trying this dish -- it was very good. The only criticism is when they say minced, they're serious. The sour sausage (which looked suspiciously like tiny cubes of chopped up ham steak) was hard to pick out (tastewise) from the other flavors. We ordered it medium and it was plenty spicy (we had two small children with us). This is a dish that I suspect gets better when you dial up the heat -- but even at medium was outstanding. I ordered the PORK STEW NORTHERN CURRY (#K. from the NORTHERN menu) and it was good. This is a \"dry\" style curry so if you're looking for lots of gravy to sop up with your rice go another direction. Some of the chunks of pork were fatty and some were a bit parched. I am a sucker for anything braised (I like the mouth feel) but without much liquid everything seemed a little dry. Still, overall, the dish had, as other reviews have mentioned, a nice homey feel. THAI LIME DRINK was a nice touch on a hot LAS VEGAS afternoon. However, the YELLOW CURRY (#129 with chicken) was really disappointing. My wife ordered it to share with the kids since it's one of their THAI favorites. In all fairness WYATT, my three-year old, ate more than his share and seemed to enjoy it -- then again he insisted on a McDONALD's happy meal on the drive over from SAN DIEGO. The chicken was grainy. The carrots were really al dente, the potatoes were nearly raw (literally not figuratively) and the yellow-curry and coconut cream base were thin and sadly bland. I think if it sat on a steam table for an hour or two the vegetables would have cooked through and the curry itself would have reduced down and concentrated the flavor. The single best THAI restaurant in North America ???

This fault isn't particular to ethnic restaurants: most high-end restaurants succumb to the same pattern of early greatness followed by plateau and then slow, steady decline (if they ever reach the heights to begin with).To be fair, the food was very good. It was not extraordinary or even top 10%. Fresh mushroom salad was an interesting idea, half-realized.

I could really taste the different spices put into that make it burst in your mouthPrawn salad: Very interesting combination of sweet and spicy. Prawns were huge and seared slightly. Probably the least favorite out of all I ate.Crispy duck curry: Crispy duck was ... very crispy. I think the coconut milk curry was excellent, but the duck could have been any crispy meat and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I just like this because curry is awesome with rice.Chicken pad thai: This was my favorite. I can tell this place is awesome by how amazing they make their pad thai. The noodles didn't stick together and the flavor was evenly distributed across every noodle. The peanut sauce was there for the kick and not overpowering. Chicken was tender and a nice addition.Tom Yum soup: We ordered this after eating everything else because we needed to get a taste of the other popular thing on Thai menus. \u00a0Yum. Must try. It wasn't lit on fire like at Jaiya, but it was delicious and the perfect amount of spicy and sour.Overall, I can't wait to go again.

This is probably the most spacious Thai restaurant I've ever been to - in addition to accommodating multiple large party banquets at the time of our dinner, the restaurant was also serving patrons seated at the full bar (a traditional Thai restaurant with a full bar - classic Vegas; complete anomaly). Despite the strong fight put up by the drunken noodles and the tom yum noodle soup, I ultimately went for the pork larb ($8.95) with a side of sticky rice ($2) per my waiter's recommendation on the basis of both popularity and healthiness. According to him, the larb - consisting of \"lean\" ground pork mixed with red and green onions and cilantro bathed in a spicy/fishy chili lime dressing, accompanied by a few cucumber slices and a petite wedge of raw cabbage - is prepared with no fat and is one of the most popular menu items. While the dish was undeniably tasty, I found it to be wildly underwhelming on the whole - the flavors tasted exactly identical to the seasoning packets used in Mama brand ramen (which I love but don't need to pay restaurant prices for). The biggest disappointment of all was the dismally poor quality of the pork. Contrary to my waiter's word, the meat was EXTREMELY fatty, and I found myself picking out the visible chunks of fat as I ate. I definitely should've gone for the shrimp instead, but we were in a hurry and didn't have time to wait for a new dish to come out. The sticky rice was a more moderate disappointment - the rice used is a longer grain than what I encountered in Thailand, so it was more fluffy than sticky. Save yourself $1 and just order the regular steamed rice. Even though I wasn't impressed with what was a solid 2 star meal, I attribute that more to mis-ordering than bad establishment. Service was fantastic, and you can tell the chef takes great pride in the restaurant and cooking/her food in general. I'm not sure along which basis people can claim this is the best Thai food in America, but I'd be interested in returning if I ever get the chance to try the more specialty / creative menu items, such as the drunken noodles and various seafood offerings - I'd just recommend staying away from the pork.", "Date": "2013-10-05", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "ben n.", "ReviewID": "CW7dFQ6bJUNxp7Z36NMajg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What can I say?

We started with a fish cake, Issan style beef jerky, and a crispy rice with sour sausage. The first two were very, very good and the third was OK. The jerky was excellent and not too tough. It had very interesting spices and the sauce gave it a nice kick.We decided to go with the Northern Thai menu options since they seemed really unique. I went with Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry) which is described as being \"almost sweet\". It wasn't but it was very spicy. Not quite Thai spicy, but a litle strong. It did not have as much sauce or broth as I was excpecting but it was a nice portion size and was well seasoned besides the spice. Wife went with Khao a Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle served in curry sauce and coconut cream. Waiter recommended beef and it was an excellent dish. For dessert we shared a nice dish of coconut ice cream which was a perfect end to the meal.We arrived at 7:30 for our reservation on a Friday and there was consistently between 5 and 10 people waiting for a table.

We have been in a bowling league with most of the waitstaff for about a year now, and we've been meaning to go there. When an article about this year's James Beard award floated my way, I noticed that among the nominees, which included the Chefs from Joel Robuchon and Rick Moonen, was the Chef from Lotus of Siam. That sealed the deal; we had to go there as soon as possible.The restaurant is easy to drive right by; there's a sign on what looks like a warehouse on Sahara, just east of the Strip. Never fear; the entrance is on the other side, and the ambiance is nice. We didn't have reservations but got in at 7PM on a Saturday night with no problem. The crowd started showing up at 8, so I would recommend reservations for a later meal.The wine list is huge, but since I didn't know what I was planning on eating, I just ordered a beer. They have both Singha and Chang beer from Thailand. The menu is similarly huge, probably ten pages of dishes conveniently numbered so you don't have to fumble through pronunciations if you aren't used to ordering Thai food.I started with the Tom Yum Kai soup, which is my favorite thing to eat at Thai restaurants. I asked for it hot-spicy. Heed my warning: If you're at all nervous about your heat threshold, go for medium-spicy. I love really spicy food, so I thought the soup was great. I also ordered the Spicy Catfish. It was thin filets of fish battered and fried, with a delicious sauce, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I even had leftovers since we ordered so many other dishes.Other things ordered were the stuffed chicken wings appetizer, the chicken satay with peanut sauce, and the jackfruit dish, which was, I believe, mashed jackfruit, pork, and herbs in a spicy sauce. That one was delicious, as was everything else. My Dad ordered a salmon dish, which he said was really great. I believe it because there was absolutely nothing left on his plate when he was done, and the man knows his salmon. Devin ordered the Pad Thai, which was probably the best I've ever had. The noodles were very thin compared to the rice stick noodles that are usually used for Pad Thai, and it was also hot enough to excite my spice-seeking palate, even when ordered at medium-spicy.Then came dessert. One of my favorite things in the world is sticky rice with mango, so we ordered that. They put a dessert platter together for us that included the rice, mango, some coconut ice cream, and some fried bananas. They do their fried bananas in phyllo dough, which is something I'd never seen before, and I loved it. Do not skip dessert, even if it means taking some of your main course home like we did.The service was excellent, and I'm not just saying that because our waiter was one of our bowling buddies. They were attentive, and when we asked to take about five different things home, they took the plates away and boxed everything separately for us. Most impressive and refreshing: My Dad asked the waiter what he should order from two choices, and the waiter honestly told him which dish he liked better (the salmon), instead of pulling the, \"Well, they're both good...\" junk that waitstaff usually gives you when you ask for a recommendation.I thought the price was incredible considering how much food we had. Including food, drinks, dessert, and two hours of just fun eating, we walked out at less than $40 a person. Parking is convenient, abundant, and free.I can see why people call this place the best Thai restaurant in America. It's the best one that I've been to.

LOS is definitely the second. This world famous restaurant serves a wide variety of dishes out of a small, unassuming storefront within the commercial center shopping block. The interior is a combination of fancy wine bar [glass covered wine racks, marble counters, lacquered wood, etc] and cheesy chinese restaurant. The food itself is the star, so I don't mind.We started with a glass of wine each. I had a semi-dry riesling while J had a pinot noir. Both were fabulous and the wine list is epic! My riesling was fruity and crisp without being overbearing. It was a nice counterpoint to the spicy food. J's red wine was very smooth without any acidityI ordered a cup of the Tom Kha Kai, a sweet and tangy coconut based soup with tender pieces of chicken and lots of veggies and fresh herbs. Most places use substandard chicken for this soup but that was not the case here. The soup was rich and extremely flavorful, easily the best thai soup I've ever had! We also had the papaya salad. I ordered it at a spice level of 9-10 and it was definitely spicy! It snuck up on me after a few bites and was quite strong, but the overall flavors were excellently executed. The contrast of pungent, savory, sweet, nutty, herbal and chiles was something I could find addictive. When we were leaving some of the employees seemed impressed, \"Ah, spicy number 10! that was you!\"Next came the crispy duck with chu-chee sauce and garlic prawns. We originally inquired about the lobster, but they were out for the day and recommended the prawns instead. The crispy duck was tender with a light, crisp crust and a rich curry sauce. This was J's favorite and is a fabulous way to eat duck! The sauce is great over rice. The garlic prawns looked like a huge portion but it turned out that half the pile were empty shells. It was a bit deceiving but even the empty shells were pretty good with the seasoning. The prawns themselves were great, juicy and large. I don't think I would order this again if I weren't celebrating but it was very tasty.I also had a thai iced coffee to go. It was a strong coffee with chicory flavors and a good balance of sweet and creamy to the bitter coffee. The portion was generous, too!This is probably some of the best thai food you can find if you don't have a doting thai grandmother to lavish upon you. The meal ended up costing us almost $100, but it was worth it for a once a year celebration.

Not too long ago, it was one of those hidden finds off the touristy Las Vegas Strip. Thanks to rave reviews from people across the country, as well as attention from the James Beard Foundation, the restaurant is squarely on everyone's radar.GARLIC BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS - These were very crunchy and probably a bit overcooked. Surprisingly, I also found them rather bland. I'm curious if perhaps we received the wrong order, as there wasn't really any noticeable black pepper.STUFFED CHICKEN WINGS - These wings were better, stuffed with some pork. Really meaty with a nice, light crunch to them. These weren't as moist as I thought they could've been though.TOM KAH KAI (Bangkok Style) - I'm actually not at all familiar with this soup, but it was popular on Yelp. It didn't look like the most appetizing thing, but it was pretty good. There was a little bit of heat here, balanced by some lime juice and the coconut milk. Kind of reminiscent of a Chinese hot & sour soup. Kind of.COMBINATION BEEF NOODLE SOUP - My mother was craving some soup noodles, however this was a little too spicy for her. It had a lingering spice that seemed to compound. \u00a0The broth had a lot of beefy depth, and I really liked the noodles here. Comforting.SEA BASS DRUNKEN NOODLES - Wonderful dish.

My co-workers suggested we head over there to have me try their lunch buffet, which they told me they've enjoyed in the past. The buffet setup is located in the central part of the older dining room. If I can recall, 15-20 items are served, from hot foods to desserts. I grabbed my plate and piled on the Pad Thai, egg rolls, tempura veggies and yellow curry chicken.Pad Thai: Wasn't blown away by this. The noodles reminded me more of egg noodles. I'm not an expert on Thai food, but aren't flat rice noodles used in Pad Thai? Also, the flavor was insipid. Egg Rolls: I'm hesitant when trying egg rolls at restaurants. For me it's hit or miss. The egg rolls I tried at Lotus were easily forgettable. Just your typical deep fried veggie egg rolls.Yellow Curry Chicken: Too watery in my opinion, and not enough chicken, veggies, curry, or spices.Tempura Veggies: Not even sure if the veggies were really tempura battered. Perhaps it was deep fried for too long, because they were too brown.For dessert I tried the banana egg rolls, which is the best item from that buffet. I enjoyed the taste of the sweetened, finely shredded coconut combined with a ripened banana. Definitely different from the Filipino banana egg rolls that I'm used to pigging out on called turon.

(so apparently they take reservations and can be overly booked) we expressed our need to catch a flight and the waiter was very kind in finding a seat for us as quickly as possible. when we sat down and started to checking out the interior of the restaurant, we realized where the \u00a0owner have spent all her money. the interior decoration looks like a fancy, high-class dining room with chandeliers, hard wood tables and chairs, mirror-like clean floors and a huge wine collection!it's quite unfortunate we were not able to try the wine due to time constraints and we only had one dish as neither me nor my bf was hungry. we tried the crisp duck curry \u00a0as recommended and it turns out to be really really great! the duck was crispy outside, juicy inside and when the curry swims in your mouth, you would want to bite your tongue off!

So much so that a couple of weeks later when I was apparently dying of the plague, I dragged myself out of bed to go get take out from there because let's get real: tom kha kai is the Southeastern Asian version of chicken noodle soup.The tom kha kai here is wonderfully balanced and what I really liked was that the chicken wasn't tough. I've frequently had this soup with unhappy pieces of rubbery chicken floating in it, but at LOS the chicken is cooked perfectly meaning they didn't leave it boiling in the soup forever. There's also a good amount of vegetables which could make you feel less guilty about eating an entire hot pot by yourself (which I would've had it been socially acceptable). Also enjoyed here were the drunken noodles which I'd never had before anywhere. Sauce=amazing. Amount of seafood=criminally abundant. They don't skimp on the seafood in this dish and it's pretty reasonably priced for what you get.LOS is worth a trek for an authentic Thai food experience.

She hadn't yet been but said it was considered some of the best Thai food in the country. We arrived a bit early and ordered a Singha to share. They have an extensive wine list with many by the glass but we'd just come from Valley of Fire and were thirsty, so beer seemed to fit the bill.It wasn't busy yet so we got a lot of time with our waiter and asked him what he recommended. The menu is pretty extensive and there are a lot of really interesting things to choose from, good descriptions too! He pointed out a few house specials and we ended up ordering entirely from his recommendations. We started off with the crispy rice and sausage appetizer. My boyfriend loved it. I thought it was spicy and salty but didn't taste like much.Then, we ordered three dishes to share among three of us. Crispy duck with drunken noodles, short ribs in red curry, and the liver which the other two wanted to try. The crispy duck was by far the best of the three. Really delicious, good portion size too. The short ribs were amazing but there wasn't enough. I think there were four. For $20, I thought we'd get more than an appetizer size. But the sauce was really good over the rice. The liver tasted less like liver than I'm used to, the fresh lime and onion was really nice, but it was pretty dry and didn't come with any sauce. Overall, the ambiance of the place is okay. Not anything memorable and the lighting is bright and unremarkable. We liked the food but it's pretty rich and we felt a little ill later in the evening. It was pretty expensive too! I enjoyed it but don't feel a need to come back.I'm still trying to figure out how this place has over 700 reviews on Yelp and is so highly rated given that there is a lot of really good food in Las Vegas. It seems to have a very good PR person!

Waiters always stopped by to fill glasses of water and always with a smile. - Variety of choices: This restaurant's menu is literally a book. It is HUGE. Here you will find Thai dishes from all different regions, and all seemingly pretty tasty.Just ok:- Drunken noodles with crab: Most excited to try this, but the crab was disappointing. It was so fried that it was soft and soggy. - Nam Kao Tod: The crispy fried rice appetizer; this had a funky sour taste, but I was the only one at my table that didn't enjoy it so to each his own!The good thing is that their menu is so extensive that picky eaters will have to find something to like. The not so good things are that portion sizes aren't huge for what you're paying for.

While I do appreciate my go-to, hole-in-the-wall Thai place, \"King and I\", down the street, I think that the quality of Lotus' food is much higher. Some of the dishes we had (we had a lot, so I don't remember the names of all of them), but red curry with duck, panang curry with tofu and chicken, drunken noodles with sea bass, papaya salad, glass noodles with chicken, crispy rice, and a couple other dishes I can't remember. All of them were delicious. My personal faves were the drunken noodles and panang curry. We also had dessert...mango with sweet sticky rice, and fried bananas with ice cream....yummm! We also had two bottles of wine. It was a LOT of food, and we only ended up paying about $45 bucks each between 6 girls...a pretty good deal, considering how much we ordered, and we were stuffed at the end.Service: The waiter was very attentive. Plenty of refills without asking. Decor: Nothing fancy, but it has a nice ambiance, moreso than your typical hole-in-the-wall.Location: It's kind of in a sketchy part of neighborhood, Sahara Ave and \u00a0Commercial Ctr.

Tom Yum Noodle soup was well below average as well and again, one of the worst I've had of this dish.

I've tried the Paid Thai, Pad See Yew, Beef Salad, drunken noodles, the various curries, garlic prawns, and spicy chicken wings. One word of caution - be prepared for the heat - when they ask you how hot you want, dont go overly crazy. I can handle a lot of heat, but their level 5 is hot enough to enjoy.

But pretty good.Spicy Fried Rice - What the hell?! No one asked how spicy we wanted it?! This shit burned our stomachs and my thai iced tea was goooone. I love spicy food but they were literally trying to start a fire in my throat. Tasty nonetheless!Chili Mussels - Pretty good, but I'm not too big on mussels. My dad liked it though.Musaman Curry - The tastiest curry ever. We got it with tofu and it was really good. I was bummed the bowl was so small.Service was pretty good too, so that of course is a plus. But because I'm real picky about my food (well at least when I went there), it didn't get the 5 stars I was really hoping to give. Great place though, and from the looks of it this place is loved by many. If I'm in Vegas again, I'll definitely come by again.

The area didn't exactly look promising, but once we saw the crowd inside, we knew something was up. We knew we were about to have an awesome meal.Food - We started with the Nam Kao Tod, which is Crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. The spiciness was perfect, although too much for my spice-sensitive gf, but she still enjoyed it enough to brave through it. Yum. 4 out of 5Then we had the Tom Kha Gai as recommended by the waitress. This is when I knew I had to rave about this place on yelp. The taste was perfect. It was the taste that I would compare all tom kha/yum variations to. Noone else comes close. Seriously. 6 out of 5? lolOf course, we had to try the Pad Thai. My girlfriend and I always judge the quality of a Thai restaurant based on their pad thai. Why? Because every Thai restaurant has it and it is probably the most popular Thai dish in the US, thus, every Thai restaurant should not only have it, but they better deliver in quality. They did not disappoint. This was the best Pad Thai I've ever had. another 6 out of 5.Service - our waitress was a Thai lady.

I just had Thai food the other day and most of the time I don't like repeating similar types of food for at least a few days/meals.. BUT Thai Noodle House left such a savory taste in my mouth that I wanted More!! BUT More from a new place, a place that so many people seem to worship! This place doesn't seem to lure in just us locals but also the rich and famous! I'm ready for Thai food Round 2:What gave me a New Outlook on Thai Food:Ground Chicken Larb: ground chicken with chopped onion, green chili, lime juice and fresh cabbage- Tried this because it was recomended. Quite Fresh, Limey, Crunchy (cabbage) and Chicken was Good. And Most importantly Spicey!! for me at least.. We opted for 4/10 (default, if you don't mention how spicy, you get thir medium hot which starts at 4 Not 5) on the heat scale and this already made me feel like a fire breathing dragon!! Don't be fooled, if your not into spicy you may want to order a 3 at most. For comparison: I've tried a 10/10 heat scale at Pin Kaow and Thai BBQ.. The 4 here was hotter! Drunken Noodle Sliced Chicken: pan fried flat noodle, topped with sauteed chicken, fresh and dry chili, thai basil on a bed of greens- My girl doesn't really eat seafood, so she substituted for chicken. I thought I've tried Great Thai flat noodle chicken dishes in the past but boy was I wrong! Chicken Tender and Very Tasty, Herbs and Spices (3/10 heat) was just right and flat noodles couldn't be any better! Pad Se-Ew Sliced Pork: stir-fried flat rice noodle with egg, chinese broccoli and black soy sauce- One of my favorite all time Thai dishes. I never tried a bad version of this dish but their pork here was better than any I've tried and again the flat noodles stood out themselves. 4/10 heat scale but didn't seem to have as much heat as the Chicken Larb dish?.. Really Good for Pad Se-ew.Drunken Noodle Halibut: deep fried halibut filet with homemade fresh chili and thai basil, over pan fried flat noodles- Best Thai dish I've Ever Had.. Period. I don't know where to start.. The fish fillet had a nice breading, lightly fried and was flaky fresh. Their blend of chilis/herbs/spices blend were Unreal!!!! All on top of their pan fried flat noodles! By now you should know how I feel about their flat noodles! I ordered this at a 5/10 thinking it wouldn't be too much heat but it was blazing! Next time I would order this at a 3 but it was So Magically Delicious, \u00a0it didn't matter!!Thai Iced Tea:- Great way to subside the heat from the food! Had a stronger flavor than usual.Coconut Ice Cream:- Very Fresh Islandy Flavor! If you have room for it, Try It!After having Homemade Thai food and Several Thai restaurants, I think its safe to for me to consider this place the Mecca of Thai Food! \u00a0The drunken noodle halibut \u00a0revolutionized the way I view Thai Cuisine.

The only glitch in the evening was during dinner service; one or two meals trickled out behind the rest. When I inquired within, it was explained that they have several cooks preparing at different stations so the timing for each meal prepared is not always exactly on point with the rest. With that being said, all is forgiven for these delicious eats. It's quite a daunting task for most restaurant establishments to place the correct order, number one, let alone place it and not forget to bring it all to the table at the same time.My take on food quality is this. Quite tasty. Being oh so unoriginal, I ordered the Pad Thai and vegetable fried rice. I know, I know.. for someone so creative there is a lot to be said about my creativity while dining..but I digress.The Pad Thai was exceptionally delicious, not dry, noodles cooked to perfection.

I read that if you eat here and you want to be blown away you should stick to their specialties: northern thai food. so stay away from anything typical like pad thai or in this case cashew chicken. BUT it was still a delicious item and I had no complaints about it.coconut ice cream with fried bananas and sticky rice - I had read that their sticky rice with mangoes is one of the top desserts in the US. Unfortunately, mangoes are not in season in the winter. I was sooo sad. But the waiter recommended this dish which blew us all away. the coconut ice cream was super refreshing and not too coconutty and the sticky rice was PERFECT. I'm drooling just thinking about it....Thai Lime Drink - If you like limes you'll love this drink. It tastes like the vietnamese lime drink to me so it wasn't anything special cuz I drink it everytime I have pho but I love limeade so if you've never had it, definitely order this!overall, we all had a great meal here and I will definitely be coming back to try some other dishes next time I'm in vegas.

Since it was just the 2 of us, we said of course! I would recommend reservation esp if you have a big party. \u00a0It looks like they had a separate section for a bigger party (maybe 20+) but the biggest table I saw sat 12 people comfortably. \u00a0The food was excellent! \u00a0We skipped the appetizer and went straight for the meal. We had the green papaya salad, drunken seafood noodles, and red curry with chicken. \u00a0We asked for everything mild and It was \"just right, a little sweat and tears\" spicy. \u00a0It came with a side of jasmine rice but we had 1 order of sticky rice esp for the curry! Yum! \u00a0The portions weren't huge but between the both of us, we ate pretty much everything. \u00a0Now, we could've been done without desert but the table next to us ordered a whole bunch and we couldn't resist! \u00a0So, we had shared 2 of them: fresh sliced mango with sticky rice topped with a light cream sauce AND coconut ice cream. Oooooh, so yummy! \u00a0Yes, we finished that without a problem.The service was good. \u00a0We had a bunch of people helping us and our water glass was never empty. \u00a0Thank goodness with all the spicy-ness! \u00a0The one thing I thought was strange was that after we got our food, no one came by to ask us how things were until we were almost done eating everything. Then again, maybe that's probably why huh? They probably didn't want to interrupt the \"shoveling\" of food! Ha! We will definitely go again. \u00a0I'm curious about their lunch buffet that was being advertised as $8.95. \u00a0Our meal described above (including desert) was all under $50! \u00a0Thanks for all of your reviews.

I ended up leaving and making a reservation for dinner 2 days later. If you want to eat here at dinner without a wait, you MUST call in advance!Our waiter was extremely helpful in explaining the menu items, since nobody in my group was familiar with thai food. He was very patient and gave us helpful suggestions, and our water was always promptly filled.

Hence my drinking 3 glasses of water, and thank goodness my waiter was prompt in refilling my water because I might've died otherwise. If you ask for a number higher than 5, know what you're getting into: A 10 would be practically nuclear. I can't recommend the fried catfish enough. It's one of their specialties, and for good reason. We ordered fried catfish with basil. The catfish pieces were so tender and flavorful, they tasted like a much more expensive fish. Any of the curries is also delicious. One dish I do not recommend is any of the dips. For $10, all you get is a plate of blanched vegetables (which are pretty fresh, to their credit) and a cold \"dip\" which is often more like a salad. But the other items we had more than made up for this miss.

We came with no reservations, and the hostess took our phone number so we could either go to the bar or leave during the 45 min wait. We walked around the \"Around the World\" strip mall and eventually got our call. (We call it that because you have Thai, Korean, American and Mexican themed restaurants and businesses all in one place). The waiter was probably what really made this place special. He had a great grasp on the extensive wine list (We ordered a bottle, and he confirmed to see if we knew what it was we were ordering...we did, but nice that he checked) and gave great recommendations so we could share dishes and have everything still pair nicely with the German Riesling. My wife had the Panang Curry (at an 8 spicy level, which she said was perfect) with noodles and I had the crispy duck with chili mint leaves. The noodles made for a messy meal, because the curry splashed around as my wife and I ate the noodles. The crispy duck was something I've been craving ever since, and may be in one of my top 5 meals ever.The food came quickly, and our waiter was always nearby if we needed anything. He also came and brought a bucket of ice for our wine - something unexpected at a Thai restaurant.

First time diner, long time admirer. Okay this will be a somewhat incomplete report. Not that I didn't have dinner there nor did I leave early. Nope. I had appetizer, salad, main course and dessert. So why the incomplete?Well, with over 150 items (I can't remember the full count) there's a lot to try. With this first visit, we decided to go Thai lite. But not to worry dear Yelpers, I have more visits planned. Luckily, my sister teaches at the high school just down the street so I'll always have an excuse. So enough with the pleasantries. Time for the food goodness. To start, we had fried chicken dumplings. It was good though not entirely memorable. I liked eating it but I don't have to have it on my next visit. Also up for starters is the traditional Thai salad with peanut dressing. I don't need to say much about this except that my brother in law was slurping up the dressing and kept the bowl of dressing on the table after the salad greens were removed. (He later poured some on his steamed rice. Don't ask.)For the main dishes, we went with pad Thai (good), sua rong hai (yummy grilled beef with a nice spicy sauce) and panang curry with chicken (my favorite out of the three). For dessert we had a rice pudding and fried banana roll. Both if these are very good. I especially enjoyed the banana roll with coconut sugar(?) wrapped in fried crispy wonton goodness. I could've eaten just the innards (good by their lonesome) if I wanted to save a few calories. But why bother living at all? So just shove it all in your mouth and swallow, calories be dammed. (Get your minds out of the gutter, but the double entendre is understandably apropos.) So nothing mind-blowingly exciting but good solid eating. I spent a lot of time looking at other tables' orders like the whole fried fish or battered shrimp that caught my eye. Yes, I had prawn envy. But I vow to return and try all the other goodies. If my first tastes are good enough to go back before the check has even arrived, then you know me likey. Next time you're in Vegas, stop by and get some prawns.

I had the Panang curry with chicken. In all truth, it was quite delicious. Without the sickness that would follow the next 24 hours, this would be 4 stars. My stomach has only now recovered enough to allow me to write a review without feeling like I am going throw up again. I was with three other people, nobody else got sick. But this was all I had to eat that night, my previous meal was at Top of the World at Stratosphere for lunch, and was 7 hours before LOS, and my only drink of the night was the Thai beer I had with my meal, so I think it is safe to assume that the food here caused the illness.

Our taxi driver asserted that the shopping center that the Lotus of Siam is situated in is the first shopping center in Vegas. I haven't fact-checked him, but it did seem like it'd been around for quite some time, especially the funky parking and overall traffic layout.Jon A. and I picked out three dishes (with the help of our server), and I opted to try the Thai lime drink. The dishes included a bowl of Tom Yum Plar Dook (hot and sour soup with catfish, lime juice, lemongrass and straw mushrooms), roasted duck curry, and beef Khao Soi (Northern Thai egg noodles in curry sauce and coconut cream with your choice of beef or chicken, served with a side of with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables). Including Jon's soft drink, we ended up $45 lighter, including tax and tip.Everything was delectable, but we suspected that they may have mixed up our spice-level orders. Jon's spiciness tolerance level is much higher than mine, so we ordered the communal soup and my roasted duck curry as a six, and the Khao Soi was to be a ten. However, after profusely sweating through the catfish soup and hoping I'd be able to handle my curry, we realized that the soup was probably the ten and the entrees both ended up sixes. Oh, well: everything was delicious, and I'd go back and order that soup at a ten again. The heat from both temperature and spiciness really hit the spot! And the Thai lime drink?

It is inside a glass case where you can see each wine. I ordered pineapple fried rice and Thai tea. The tea was amazing. It's definitely better than Archi's. The fried rice was quite dry. I don't think I'll order it again. The good news is that the shrimp in my fried rice didn't smell fishy. Overall, the service was great and I would go back even as a local.

For me, I love Komol in the same business plaza, Commercial Center. I finally decided to check it out. We unwittingly showed up like 15 minutes early. We waited in the car and there was a line forming outside the restaurant. I thought, Holy crap, maybe this is the Holy Grail of Thai food. In Vegas. They had a buffet going on for lunch, but I wanted my first LOS experience to be a pure one. I copped a look at the buffet and it didn't look that great anyway. It looked kinda Chinese. The menu was large and had clear descriptions (in FOBese) of the items. And although you can make a lot of Thai meat dishes vegetarian, they did not have a section of the menu specifically for vegetarians. Like Komol. To start, we ordered the famous tom kah kai soup. It was really good, but really fattening, I think all it is is coconut milk, chili oil, and maybe chicken broth with bland chunks of chicken, straw mushroom, and cilantro (?). But I could sit there and drink the broth all day. You can get a cup, bowl, or hot pot. I think my cup was $4. We tried the panang just because I needed to compare and contrast to neighboring Komol's killer panang. I always get the tofu panang because I'm a part-time vegetarian (fair weather, really). LOS's panang was just like red curry. I don't know what's closer to original recipe, LOS or Komol's, but Komol's just tastes better. Its really robust and hearty. LOS's was really smooth and wussy. It just slipped off the tofu. We also got the steamed mussels. They steam it in fish sauce and basil leaves and give you a green chili lime dipping sauce which has even more fish sauce and is deceptively spicy. Just because it ain't red, don't mean it ain't spicy. It was really fishy. And the sauce was way too hot for me consume.We got the sweet sticky rice dessert, which I think is normally supposed to come with mango, but they were 86 for the day. The dessert was good. Standard stuff. But the coconut milk was really thick and they garnished the rice with a crispy topping, like baked rice or something. That gave the texture a nice variation. Sorry, I don't have a cost breakdown of all the items, but for the two of us three entrees, two sticky rice, two drinks, and dessert, and some leftovers, our total bill was $53 before tip. Not bad, I guess. Holy crap, we did eat a lot ... Our entrees ranged $8-15. The restaurant has a homey kind of ambiance. The ceiling is low and the walls are decorated with Thai things and pictures of the proprietress (I'm guessing) and guests. I like the way the restaurant is sectioned. It keeps the noise down. By the time we were done with our meal, the restaurant was packed and the buffet was wrecked. I appreciate this place. Their menu is impressive, the food and service was good, it was clean, and prices were decent, but I'd pick Komol over Lotus of Siam. Komol hits the same points, but their panang is better. Haha. I think I'll come to like it more when I find the super great items on the menu.(To date, Lotus of Siam has 120+ reviews and Komol has 7.) * off the strip, non-casino", "Date": "2008-09-26", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Quinn B.", "ReviewID": "oaX_BOxWlV5btyuOZ2KtDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best Thai food in Vegas!

But we're in Vegas for her soon-to-be husband's bachelor party, so she's not my sister-in-law yet. Think that's confusing? Ask yourself why the best Thai food in Las Vegas is in a Korean strip mall?So I'm meeting my brother's future in-laws for the first time. There's about a dozen of them, and we're at Lotus of Siam. Somehow we got reservations for Easter dinner, because if we didn't have reservations, we'd still be waiting outside for a table.I'm not the most adventurous eater. I'm a fan of Thai food, but I'm fine with the dishes I know and love. Lotus of Siam has a lot of northern Thai dishes that aren't served at most Thai restaurants, and a lot of seafood dishes. I wanted some chicken with basil and a green curry. Both were very good. Neither changed my worldview. Future sister-in-law couldn't remember what Thai dishes she liked. Her future husband remembered and ordered for her. That's why they're married now.So if all you know about Trinidad is that Obama just visited there, you might not know that Trinis love spicy food. S-i-l's father makes his own hot sauce every two weeks because he uses so much of it. He loved the food here. S-i-l's cousin couldn't stand the spice in his cup of soup. This is why when the server asks you how spicy you want your food, you have to pay attention and not try to impress anyone. Our server (who may very well have been the owner) tried very hard to please a table full of people most of whom had never eaten Thai food before. She largely succeeded.So my recommendation would be to come to Lotus of Siam if you like Thai food, if you're interested in dishes that you can't get in most other restaurants, or if you like really spicy food. If you're a Thai fan, order one thing you would normally get, and then branch out to one thing on the menu that sounds good but you've never tried. If you throw in some appetizers, you'll certainly not go home hungry. I was stuffed, and wished I had ordered something besides my usuals.Reservations are important, especially for large parties.

Service was a little bit slow at times but eventually our server opened up and gave us a smile and great customer service.

We were a little surprised at first but then were relieved that our mouths weren't completely on fire. We got the Hot Pot size and it was $14 ( a little expensive ), but the portions were HUGE. So it made sense. I definitely recommend this coconut based soup with chicken and vegetables.** Chicken Satay -- I like simple dishes. This dish was simple and delicious. BBQ chicken on skewers with a great peanut sauce and the cucumber salad. ** Pad Thai with Chicken -- I'm not a fan of places that serve Pad Thai with ONLY a certain type of meat. I'm used to having some egg, chicken, tofu and shrimp in my noodles. So it would have been nice to have a few mroe ingredients, but in general the pad Thai was good. The noodles were a little bit thicker than what I like, but the flavor was very good. Pad Thai is the \"make or break\" dish for me, and I feel like they delivered well with the Pad Thai.** Pineapple Fried Rice -- This was probably the weakest dish. It wasn't very \"fried\" but more like a rice mixed with curry powder. It made the rice have a lackluster texture that was in between moist and dry. It was confusing. The pineapple did deliver a nice fresh crunch and juice, but I've had better.After going over my whole order, it wasn't that this place isn't good.

Amaze balls! So worth it, that after a bite or two, we had to order another plate for us! Who knew that prawns could be sooo tasty that you wouldn't think twice about eating the shell?The menu is quite extensive, so we were only able to sample several dishes here. We tried the red chili dip (Ming Tsai's recommendation), chicken satay, the chicken soup with a coconut base and hints of lemongrass (amazing!), seafood salad, braised short ribs (panang). All were tastefully done and lived up to the spice level scale. Since they didnt have the mango sticky rice (our server said they only have this during the summer), I settled for an order of fried bananas with coconut ice cream; it did not disappoint.I was highly impressed with the service that we received once we were seated,given that it was a typical busy Friday night. Our drinks were refilled constantly and both of our servers seemed to be on the same page. We were always greeted with smiles from our two servers and they seemed genuinely happy to know that we really enjoyed our first meal at Lotus of Siam.My biggest lesson learned from this visit was reservations, reservations, reservations!! It was obvious that the word is out about the fantastic food here at Lotus of Siam, so make reservations as early as you can to avoid being put on the waitlist. Unfortunately, I tried making reservations for a Friday night on that same day and they were all booked.Our party of three had to wait between 45-60 minutes, which seemed like a long time given that we were starving and frustrated to see people walk in and get seated once they entered.Lotus of Siam is hands down one of the best Thai restaurants that I've been to. The decor is simple and doesn't look like your typical Thai restaurants. This isn't a bad thing, as the place is still classy with a plethora of wine bottles on display and a noteworthy clean bathroom (which sadly isn't typical at a handful of Asian restaurants).

Apparently not at Lotus of Siam; all sorts of people (rich, not so rich, big, small, tourists, locals, etc. etc.) come here to enjoy awesome Thai cuisine. They have a nice menu that covers all the traditional Thai dishes (pan fried noodles, salads, curries, soups, desserts) + specific specialties that I haven't found at any other Thai restaurant.

The walk is too far for 99% of the strip population, so that's both a good a bad thing. \u00a0Good b/c they would be overrun, bad because only the die-hard foodies are willing to make the trek. \u00a0Bottom line: \u00a0Prepare to either take the bus for a few $ or a cab. \u00a0I learned you can take the bus from the strip, make one transfer and get pretty darn close so getting here should not be an excuse. \u00a0 The best bus deal is the 3 day pass.. the 2 hour ticket is a rip off. Yeah, LoS is in a strip mall which looks like it has not been renovated in 40 years but get over it. \u00a0 If you want some of the best Thai food in Vegas, LA or San Francisco, get moving, get here and get over it. It is best to make reservations or show up early when they open or be prepared to wait in the Vegas heat! \u00a0 I preferred the show up early approach when they opened but strongly recommend reservations if you want a seat at a later dinner time. I was quickly seated and found what I wanted - the Musaman Curry for my main and an appetizer of Tom Kah Kai (Bankok Style). \u00a0My wait staff was fast and efficient. \u00a0I had water, a Thai Iced Coffed and Thai Iced Tea (yeah I wanted a caffeinated \u00a0rush to keep me going) delivered pronto. \u00a0My water glass was constantly refilled and the staff was constantly checking.I must say, both dishes were really really good - a blend of flavors and ingredients which I seldom encounter. \u00a0 The Masaman Curry was chocked with chicken and not mostly potato as I've had other places. \u00a0 The Tom Kah Hai was something you must try. \u00a0It was OOTW.

I can't decide if this added to or detracted from the ambiance but it's nice to see this chef and cuisine gettings it's rightful due notoriety.The food at Lotus of Siam is the star and I was by most accounts dazzled. The menu itself is dizzying large with so many different dishes that's it's overwhelming so if you're unsure of what to order then rely on your server to help navigate this menu as they will happily make recommendations that are on point. All dishes are prepared at your requested spice level from 1-10 so be specific. My wife choose a mild level #2 while I opted for a Spicy level #7. This also worked well when moving back and forth between dishes from mild to spicy and back again.Our Food:Appetizers:Chicken Satay (Spice level #2) - Simple but beautifully balanced with a sweet peanut sauce and a cool crisp pickled cucumber salad.Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice w/ minced, sour sausage, peanuts, ginger, green onions, fresh chilies & lime juice & ) (Spice level # 7) - The crispy & crunchy texture is wonderful but this dish definitely takes a little getting used to. My first reaction was \"This is really dry\", but when combined with the sliced cucumber and fresh cabbage garnishes it was balanced and addictive.Entrees: (served w/ steamed white rice)Charbroiled Prawns w/ Spicy & Tamarind Sauce (Spice level # 2) - This was a simple, perfect shellfish presentation with butterflied prawns still in their shells, simply charbroiled and served with two contrasting sauces of spicy vs. sweet & sour.Thum-Ka-Noon (Pounded Young Jackfruit Shredded)(Spice level # 7) - This Northern Thai dish was hands down my favorite of the night by far. Shredded jackfruit, ground, sour pork & spicy tomato sauce & herbs. This was so focused and satisfying. Wow!Koi Soy (Issan Beef Tartare) (Spice level # 7) - I wanted to love this dish but I really was disappointed. The cubed, raw beef was fresh and clearly of good quality with a nice texture provided by the rice powder but I was so overwhelmed with the flavor of lime juice that I couldn't even decipher the actual primary taste of Beef Tartare.Dessert:Fresh Mango w/ Sticky Rice & Coconut Ice Cream - The mango & sticky rice themselves were awesome. I love the savoriness of this dessert combination however I was not so much a fan of the coconut ice cream as I found the texture icy and the flavor lacking any distinct natural coconut profile. I asked our server if it was made in-house and he stated they bring it in from California. It did provide some welcome temperature contrast to the cool, tart mango and the sweet, warm sticky rice but otherwise it was completely forgettable. It's worth drawing attention to the exemplary service here as it truly is by any measure fantastic. The front of the house staff were very welcoming, attentive and provided many good menu suggestions. Our water & drink glasses were never even half empty and plates arrived and were cleared at perfect intervals.I'd love to return again and try many more dishes along with the hope of finding more magnificent Thai treasures.

The strip mall in which LoS is located is not easy on the eyes by any stretch, and finding it for the first time may take a great spotter riding shotgun. \u00a0However, the inside of the restaurant is nice enough--certainly more so than the outside.I was most impressed by two of our dishes on the night we went: (1) Tom Yum Kai and (2) Pad Thai. The Tom Yum was, for me, the perfect balance of spicy and sour. Some Tom Yums I've had tend to lean more toward the sweet/sour combo, so I loved LoS' rendition. The broth was pure tasting with the wonderful flavor of lemongrass which was not overpowering. For their Pad Thai, LoS uses round noodles, making them different from the flat noodles I've had at every other Thai restaurant I've been to. The sauce for their Pad Thai was otherworldly. We also had the mee kraab appetizer, green curry with tofu, and a Northern Thai curry dish with egg noodles and pickled vegetables. The mee kraab was very sweet with a hint of fish sauce, and was enjoyed by all at our table. I particularly loved the green curry, spicy, that was accented with wonderfully-cooked eggplant. And finally, I felt the Northern Thai dish was a bit one-dimensional with a heavy-handed red curry broth. LoS met the high expectations I had. When I return, however, I'll be sure to tell them to omit MSG from all my dishes, since they cook with it by default (but our server said they'll gladly leave it out upon request). LoS is a welcome respite from the strip--a very \"normal\" restaurant amidst the glitz and glamor of all that Vegas embodies.

Sahara Avenue, Lotus of Siam is a major hit for excellent Thai cuisine. We experienced this little gem on a Friday night and, at least that night, I'm glad we had reservations. The restaurant was packed. So, consider yourself warned ... we were told they would only hold reservations for five minutes. You snooze, you lose.The restaurant is somewhat casual, so shorts and a tee-shirt would have sufficed, but a few of our group of four were dressed for a show and gambling at one of the upscale properties. Each of us would have felt comfortable either way.The delight of Lotus of Siam is not the decor or the layout; it's the food. Sooooo good. And there are more selections than one might need -- but who's to complain?! We ordered four entrees: Garlic Prawns (at the suggestion of the server); Chicken Panang; Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles (again, at the suggestion of the server); and Pineapple Fried Rice.All were excellent choices. The Garlic Prawns topped with ground black pepper were oh-so-lightly deep fried in their paper thin shells. No need to peel these crispy little delicacies -- eat 'em shell and all! The Chicken Panang contained plenty of thinly sliced chicken breast medallions soaking in a heavenly, light curry/coconut/basil/chili sauce. You may need to keep the sticky rice bowl handy, as the Panang and sticky rice mix well together. The Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles had a nice contrast of flavors between the fresh chili and Thai basil, while the fish itself maintained the mellow flavor characteristic of good sea bass. And, finally, the Pineapple Fried Rice containing curry powder, pineapple, shrimp and chicken was a good little addition -- especially with the contrast of the pineapple to the traditional Thai flavors of the other entrees.I can't eat Thai food without a Singha lager beer, which I enjoyed. Others in my group shared a bottle of wine from a reasonably long list of wines from various areas of the world. (They selected a Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand -- which at least is from the same hemisphere as Thailand!)This was the best Thai food restaurant that I've been to, hands down.

This would actually make me consider moving to Las Vegas.The girls and I went to Vegas (from LA) for a girls weekend and we wanted, no needed, Thai food. Hangovers you see.

We asked the conceirge at our hotel where some good Thai places were and once he found out we had a car he told us to go here and I am now going to call The Rio to tell them that guys needs a raise!

It's a perfect little appetizer. The crispy duck over Panang curry was the best crispy duck and Panang curry (separately) I have ever had. The duck is pan fried and has a tasty crisp on the outside and is tender and moist (without tasting fatty) on the inside. It wasn't gamey and tasted better than any chicken I've ever eaten. The curry was deliciously made with just the right amount of creaminess and spiciness. For dessert, we shared the coconut ice cream over sticky rice. The ice cream wasn't too sweet or overly coconut-y. The sticky rice was warm and \"marinated\" in a coconut milk mixture that gave it the tiniest bit of saltiness that complemented the ice cream beautifully.

Again, DON'T get the buffet lunch. It's terrible. We were there around 12:30 on a Friday and \u00a0the steam table trays were half empty.

The Yum Yai salad had almost no sauce and what litte sauce it did have lacked in any flavor.The Tom Ka Guy soup was watery and heavily lacking in taste.

And wood carvings.There's way too much to visually digest. Look at your feet. Look at your waiter. Look at your feet. Here is your food. Holy crap there's a lot to look at.The thai iced tea is delish, as it usually is. Everything we ordered based on yelp recommendations were yummy. Green curry, check. Tom Yum soup, check. Thai chicken wings, check. Duck stir fried......eh what the heck happened? It was very average \"chinese fast food\" like quality. Pad Thai was also just ok.

An absolute must-go if you are in Las Vegas. Every time I make a trip to Vegas, I always go to Lotus of Siam. Despite the hundreds of celebrities that swear by this Thai restaurant, this place is warm and has a casual environment. Always go with the Hot Pot for the Tom Yum soup, there's no comparison. It's amazing. Try mild or mild medium. I love spicy but medium was way too spicy, even for me. The Duck Penang changed my world, and the Drunken Noodle with Sea Bass made me cry for more.The only thing that Lotus of Siam could improve on, is the location - it is off the strip, and next to \"massage parlors\" and bars. It is situated quietly inside a large parking lot, so it does take awhile to find it if this is your first time. The first time I came in I thought I was lost, but nope. The second thing is the service. I have been here more than a dozen times, and I love the mango and sticky rice they serve - it's amazing, do try it if you can! However, it is reserved for \"certain\" guests. I have asked for this dessert every time I come here, but about 60% of the time they tell us they have ran out. Turns out they only serve it to certain guests. Last month when I went, I asked for this dessert - the waiter said immediately that it is \"out of season\" thus they dont have it anymore. However, our own waiter told us other wise, and brought it out for us. As we were leaving, we heard another guest asking for the same dessert and were told too that it was \"out of season.

I am from New York, a 20 minute wait for ANY type of food is considered fast. When we arrived there was no one in the waiting area except my friends and I. We were told there would be a 10 minute wait by the lady at the register until a waitress walked by and told us to follow her. I am pretty confident I know what a fully booked restaurant looks like because when I looked around, it sure wasn't it. There were literally 5 tables out of say 30 that were occupied. Rule #1: Don't lie, it just makes you look really bad.As for the food: We ordered Pad se-ew, drunken noodles with crispy duck, green curry with chicken, seafood chili and basil leaves, and two orders of sticky rice. The sticky rice was lukewarm, hard, and not the usual glutinous texture. The noodles for the pad se-ew were good but the dish was fairly bland. The flavor of the green curry with chicken was great but it left us wondering where the chicken was. The \"slices\" were almost as if they were minced. The seafood chili and basil leaves was, for the lack of a better word, awkward. The flavor of the dish did not penetrate the seafood. Besides the initial flavor upon biting, the rest of the seafood tasted as if it was boiled in plain water. The best tasting of our dishes was the drunken noodles with the crispy duck but even this had issues. There were approximately 4 pieces of duck and enough noodles to feed 1.5 people. Even though it was advertised as \"crispy\" the skin of the duck was soggy. Overall, with this being our last meal in Vegas, we were sorely disappointed.

a great meal, but.........NOT!!!!Located in a delapitated strip mall of other restaurants \u00a0and shops, this hole in the wall I thought.......might be a surprise and thus this is why there were so many positive reviews on YELP. \u00a0However, my experience was not such.You walk in and the entrance is small and 3 people can not stand comfortably. \u00a0It's a small area then you're at the cashier's and the front room is dated and has painted green lattice partitions. \u00a0The rugs appeared dirty and the lighting was dim. \u00a0this is the area we were seated. \u00a0There's another section to th right of this and you can tell it's a newer updated area and open and looked lighter and cleaner. \u00a0the bathrooms appear to be remodeled and was nice and clean.I wanted to try the buffet for $8.99 that seemed reasonable, but they didn't offer any curry dishes, or popular Thai dishes. \u00a0the variety was lacking compared to when you go to an Indian buffet restaurant. \u00a0they offered only had about 8 entrees, 2 soups, 6 misc of salad, fried shrimp chips, fried banana, fried curry pouches, apple slices and orange slices and that's it. \u00a0 I was disappointed and do not recommend their buffet at all. \u00a0 they had 2 types of soups, duck soup which had bits of duck and was greasy and the other was a egg flower soup and was good. \u00a0 They had pad thai, but it was nothing special, the fried garlic wings was good, the other dishes were just alot of stir fry vegetables, and a chow mein style noodle dish. \u00a0a green salad with ranch dressing, I didn't understand how this is Thai....why didn't they have payaya salad. \u00a0Overall, it was more of a chinese buffet type food then all Thai food.My partner ordered the Pad Sew flat noodle dish, but the waiter came out with another dish altogether. \u00a0A disappointment, but he liked the dish anyway. \u00a0 It was a beef stir fry with cashews and a bowl of rice. the waiter charged us for the incorrect dish that cost more, and he wouldn't correct the bill bc he said we accepted the dish and didn't return it back to the kitchen. \u00a0He wasn't very nice about this and the mistake was most likely due to a language barrier communication.So DO NOT go for the buffet. \u00a0Make sure you double check your order to get the right dish...best to point to the item on the menu, since English is not their first language.Most of the dishes were about $9. to $15. per entree and that's expensive compared to the bay area, probably bc they have to ship it to LV.I can't comment on their Thai dishes, but can say that the buffet is not worth it, and they should get rid of the buffet or expand it and keep it freshly stocked and not sitting there for so long. \u00a0No one refilled any of the

I can't believe I gave this place 4 stars last time purely on reputation. With my own reputation on the line, I have to take out 2 stars from before as I was truly unsatisfied from the meal.Since we did the lunch buffet last time and afterwards we read it's best to actually order off the menu at Lotus of Siam, my buddies and I ended up doing just that at dinner this past weekend. \u00a0None of us were wowed with the dinner and would just give it 3 stars at most for the dinner. After thinking about it even more, this place to me don't even deserve 3 stars.We ordered the following:1) Thai Iced Tea: Something that really can't be F-ed up, and it's pretty good here. \u00a0Nothing to complain about.2) Pineapple Shrimp Fried Rice: The fried rice had a strong curry taste, but lacked ingredients. \u00a0The portion was small, and had yes, the plate had 2 friggin shrimps and pineapples out of a can. \u00a0For $8, I expected more.3) Pad Thai: As the menu said \"It could have been one of the most popular Thai dishes of all time.\" Clearly a mistake since they probably meant to say \"It could be one of the most.....\" Anyways, usually I like pad thai at any Thai restaurant and the one done here is eh...so-so. \u00a0My friend was looking for the bean sprouts, it's like WTF happened to it?? Again, the portion was pretty dang small for something that cost $84) Spicy Catfish: Very bland and not that spicy. The fish didn't taste that fresh and I was probably the biggest fan of the dish amongst us at the table. Definitely a bad choice on our part, but hey, could that be the case with all the stuff we got?5) Chicken curry w/o coconut milk: It wasn't something we got off the curry menu, as this dish was on one of \"Siam's favorites.\" \u00a0Definitely, it was not a favorite of our's. The curry was watery, lacked in flavor and ingredients. Seriously, another epic fail in my eyes.6) Mango with sweet coconut milk sticky rice: Probably the best item we got that night. At $7.95, it wasn't cheap, but hey, nothing was really \"cheap\" here other than the fact we got a lot of bad food. I'll give credit when it's due. The mango was fresh and I liked the toasted rice on the sweet coconut milk flavored rice. Too bad we had to get 2 orders of this item since again, very skimping on the portions for the price.Seriously, over the course of the meal, I had this WTF look as I was eating. For what we paid and all the reviews of the place, I expected a lot more. Definitely more than what I had at the buffet a few months back. Maybe I'm used to LA's Thai Town or Siam I Am in Redondo's prices, but seriously, nothing was of any good value here. I know it's Vegas, but come on, it's located in this ghetto Asian strip mall. Pfft... Will I come back here again? Hell no. I could find better food eating at the Bellagio Buffet w/o leaving the strip. This meal taught me one lesson. I will truly appreciate what I have in Thai Town and the various Thai restaurants I frequent in the South Bay.Lotus of Siam = Epic Fail*Note* We were hungry enough that we hit up Echiza for the 2nd time in 2 nights.

Meat can be loaded with gristle, overcooked, or undercooked. Curry can be oily, watery, too spicy, or too bland. Noodles can be too grainy or too soft, and break easily. Lotus of Siam pretty much hit the mark on all of these counts for me. Here's our breakdown:- Chicken satay. Perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken. This is usually the canary in the coal mine for me. The chicken was good quality, perfectly cooked, and seasoned so well that I didn't even feel the need to use peanut sauce.- Yellow curry with chicken. This is mostly the reason for my 5 stars. It's my habit to only eat the chicken and the curry sauce on my rice, but on these two counts, Lotus of Siam is among the best of the best for this dish for me. The consistency was perfectly creamy, and \"medium spicy\" (4 out of 10, I think was what we asked for) provided the perfect amount of spice for those of us who don't like a ton of spice in our curry. The chicken was again fantastic quality and perfectly cooked.- Pad see ew. This was a good dish. The noodles were prepared well, and the beef was very good!- Crispy duck. This was mostly okay for me, although I'm not a big fan of duck to begin with. The seasoning was definitely the highlight of this dish for me.We came here for lunch as a group of about 7 or 8 and got pretty good service! They are only able to split checks 4 ways.

First, LoS is located in probably one of the slummiest parts of Vegas; there isn't a strip club next door, but there are numerous sex and fetish shops across the street and just down the block. I don't recommend taking little Tommy and exploring the area before & after dinner....you may be opening the door to too many unnecessary questions. \u00a0Next, the wait time @ LoS during dinner hours on the weekend is going to be LONG. \u00a0For some reason, they don't allow reservations (guess they're so popular that they can demand such unreasonable policies). \u00a0Our table of 10 had to wait 1hr and 45 minutes, which we ended up killing at the pool table next door (**warning, it is a very divey, local pool point that's musty, dark, smokey, and seems as though everyone is selling crack or selling themselves***)So once you get past the exterior facades and downsides, LoS will undoubtedly provide you a unique Thai dining experience that you shall not find elsewhere in Vegas and most areas. \u00a0Their menu is about 10 pages long, and these are all separated into rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, chef's specialities, and then even a \"recommended\" dishes. \u00a0 I was lucky enough to go with such a large group that we ordered over 10 dishes and got to sample a wide variety of dishes. I can assert that their rice dishes are very....normal and not-special, but their noodle dishes and specialty dishes were worth the price of admission. \u00a0Their \u00a0shrimp fried rice was actually below-average (or lacked MSG lol). \u00a0 If you are a fan of fish, ask for their steamed fish that is fresh and super flavorful & tender. \u00a0Spiciness was not an issue for most dishes unless you request the \"Thai spicy\" vs \"American spicy\" \u00a0 Another memorable dish was the boneless beef ribs, which were great except you only get FOUR small little ribs. \u00a0So yes, we split that amongst 10 people through some surgical precision with our butter knife. \u00a0 Finally, the other dish I remembered was their curry. \u00a0It was flavorful, not too rich or thick, and the added meat & veggies was definitely a good complement. \u00a0Lastly, the service provided was excellent, the waiter was actually useful in suggesting good dishes, and he also seemed like a \"happy\" employee who was proud of working @ \"the best Thai restaurant in America.\" He even boasted that they had recently filmed a Top Chef episode in Vegas the week before. \u00a0Next time, I shall go again and try some newer dishes and provide an update. \u00a0Til then, I better not find another Thai restaurant anointed as \"best Thai restaurant in the World/Galaxy/Universe\" or else i'll have to reevaluate my current review :P", "Date": "2012-10-11", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Linda B.", "ReviewID": "FJHis5UgCxfKHeZXyvVDMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loved this place!

Of course, LoS was high on the list and it didn't disappoint!LoS always gets the following accolades: \"gotten the nod from the James Beard Foundation\", \"the place where all the local chefs come to eat\", \"one of the best Thai restaurants in North America\", blah blah blah. Everyone has said it, heard it and knows it. Whatever. It's great and still my gold standard outside of kidnapping my friend's Thai mom and having her cook my dishes out of my own kitchen!A few noteworthy changes if you haven't been there in awhile (since March 2010 according to our waiter):1. They've expanded into the now defunct Korean restaurant that used to be on the right side of the LoS.2. They've remodeled the inside...it's no longer the \"hole-in-the-wall\" greatness it used to be...everything is def. more upscale albeit in the same dive Commerical Center with the Green Door*.3. They expanded the old wine \"cabinet\" into a friggin' 15' glass wine cellar centered prominently in the middle of the newly redecorated interior. Way cool!4. There's a nice new shiny bar on the far right side of the resto - cool.5. 2 sets of bathroom now - the older \"boys\" and \"girls\" side on the left and now the much nicer and (thank God) larger (multi-stalls) \"men\" and \"women\" bathrooms on the left side. No more waiting in the hallways!A few extra notes/details on the food (this visit):1. We ordered four entrees (Pad See Ew, Mee Krob, Tofu Penang Curry and a Northern style curry made with catfish) and 2 apps (Tom Kha Gai and Tod Mun) for 5 people. Plenty of food and everyone finished up the meal for bill of $75 including 4 drinks. Not bad!2. Spice level was low for this meal at a \"5\" \u00a0b/c we were catering to a wide range of palates, but as a note you can always request the pepper rack for those that want more. Honestly tho, if you do request the \"10\"...it's spicy greatness and you won't be disappointed...but just be aware. I love it at the level. 3. What I loved the most (generally speaking) was the delicate flavours of the dishes. I didn't find any sort of heavy handedness when it came to the flavor profiles - not too sweet, not too gunky (no fillers), etc.4. The Penang was incredible and had this beautiful creamy nuttiness to it....you could taste the complexities of flavours in it - a richness from the coconut milk, not too sweet, with hints of the kefir in it. Just a note, if you haven't been here...most dishes can be substituted for veggie friendly (i.e., tofu) and they willingly suggest it if you can't find something you like.5. The Pad See Ew was gorgeous. It had that high heat smoky flavor to it I crave in the dish. Not too sweet and a balanced flavour with the basil leaves - i.e., not overly \"basily\" as some places make it. So good...you could taste the individual ingredients in the dish!6. I wasn't a fan of the Mee Krob, but it was tasty and well done. It's just not my favorite dish for Thai cuisine.7. The Tod Mun is done the way I like it. Thin patties that are just luscious and perfectly seasoned/fried and complemented with the cucumber dressing. The crispness of the cabbage and the cucumbers provides the perfect textural complement to the home made fish patties with bits of green onions throughout.8. The Tom Kha Gai had that nice bit of sourness and just enough heat to start off the meal properly. A very flavourful broth with the bits of lemon grass and galangal throughout.9. The unique and different item was the northern Thai style curry - it was very broth-like but good. Almost reminiscent of the Thom Kha Gai, but no lemongrass in it. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, but found it more mild in taste and the flavours were *VERY* subtle and refined. So, if you're expecting bold typical Thai flavours...be warned and you might want to pass on this dish. Otherwise, it's a nice change from the usual typical dishes one can order.A few notes on service:Excellent as always. Not too invasive, yet not too rushed. We had a leisurely dinner therefor several hours - even after finishing our meal, we sat and continued talking and never once felt like we were being rushed out. They even came by and refilled out drinks while we talked!If you haven't figured this out...yeah, I love and miss this place a lot. Living on the east coast now really highlights how different and how much better the Thai food is out west. Eitherway, if you're visiting or you already live in Las Vegas, LoS is a helluva good joint! You won't be disappointed.

I know the owner of the restaurant was featured in a chef competition that had aired recently (can't even remember which one to be honest) on Food Network.Moving on - crab cake appetizer, steamed mussels, crispy duck with chili mint sauce, crab fried rice, and rad na with beef. Crab cake appetizer - took me by surprise as the texture seemed to be more sponge like compared to the european crab cake version. Very tasty, but like I say - just a bit surprised from the texture. Steamed mussels - oh yeah a big hit! We were taken aback by the size of the mussels as they were quite large, but still very tasty! And oh baby does that sauce have some KICK! Not enough to have the fire department putting it out, but a good 'Woah what was THAT?!!!\" sensation. Crispy duck - yup sure was crispy! Meat was very tender though, and the chili mint that accompanies this dish is very refreshing. You can alter your spice level, and if it was a bit hotter would probably be better, but for the heat sensitive you still have a hint of the heat. Crab fried rice - nothing really fancy about this dish it is as it says fried rice with crab in it! Only thing about this dish to say would be to chunk up the crab meat a little more instead of having long leg chunks mixed in, to get a better ratio of crab to rice chunks. And then there is the rad na noodles with beef. The dish came out wallowing in a pot of brown gravy. And I will admit, I was disappointed at the lack of noodles in the mix. We barely had enough to go on 3 plates for the adults and 1 toddler. Plenty of beef was served up mind you, but would have preferred a bit more noodle. And the gravy, well didn't really stand out to my tongue palate - just ok.Would I eat here again? Maybe to be honest. Personally I find Komol a bit better in the taste department, but I haven't had all the specialties here at Lotus - so I can't really say. But based on what I have experienced - some dishes are WOW, and others are 'eh'.Service wise - it was busy tonight, and the staff was rushed and you could tell. The front door had a sign up asking customers to expect a 1 hr. wait for their food due to a large group being in the restaurant. We were lucky to get in beforehand, so our service was quick - but you could sense the staff was a little on edge. Our server was friendly and polite enough, but I know they were scrambling to stay on top of the large group. Anyways - that's my word for here.

The wait (good sign) was about 30 min: long enuff for us to look over the menu to decide what we wanted to try. When we saw what was brought out to other tables, the food looked so good that we had to change what we were going to order to what we saw! We were definitely getting more excited as the time drew nearer...I know that at Asian restaurants, a bunch of white people is usually not a good sign because that means that the food might not be authentic and made \"Americanized\". It was a packed house with about 50% white folks.. Got me a lil worried, but boy this time, the white folks must've known something the Asian population wasn't aware of... Rundown of our dishes:1) Tom Kum kah: coconut soup. Was ok. Nothing special.2) Garlic prawns: highlight of the evening. The seasoning was the perfect balance of salt, garlic, and pepper. The exact seasoning you would expect if you order Chinese style stir fried garlic crabs. The most surprising part of the dish was how it was prepared: with the prawn shelled but with the shell semi- attached at the tail. First, you eat the perfectly seasoned prawn. Then, you got to enjoy the bonus: the crispy prawn shell. Biting into the shell was like biting into a crispier version of chicharron ( crispy pig skin). I have never seen prawn prepared this way. WHY hasn't any other chef/ restaurant ever thought of that?!!! Lotus of Siam, thank you for this ingenious foresight......3) crispy duck in panang curry: we had originally planned to order the crispy duck with Chili n mint leaves, but our waiter suggested we order this version since we already had a similarly flavored dish. What great knowledge of the staff to provide helpful tips! He was dead on to make this suggestion. My friend krystal kept raving about the sauce. I think if she was not in public, she may have licked the plate!! LoL!!!4) drunken noodle with sea bass: at first we contemplated ordering this dish.. It was the most expensive thing we ordered at $30, but we were sold when a patron leaving the restaurant overheard our discussion and urged us to order it saying it was \"the reason why we come here\". With a reference put that way, we needed no further convincing! The sea bass was extremely fresh n flaky. The drunken noodles were perfectly wok'd: you could taste the \"fire\" of the wok. A sign that the wok has been well seasoned and the chef knows how to use that to intensify the foods being cooked in it. Awesome dish!Alas, we were too full to order dessert but the fried bananas with ice cream looked so good that we'll have to come back next time to try it.

I enjoyed the nuttiness and creaminess of the Penang Curry (paired nicely with tofu) as well as the Pad See Ew noodles. The sweetness from the palm sugar was noticeable in those dishes but were not overpowering. However, the Mee Krob crispy noodles tasted oddly chemical-like to me. I just could not eat them, and I think it was just the combination of spices and vegetables that created a strange odour and taste. The northern curry with (sparse) catfish was a little on the bland side for me and not quite what I'd expected.

Anyway, an finally, La Piste de resistance, \u00a0Khao Soi. \u00a0This typical Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle is served in curry sauce and coconut cream (your choice of beef or chicken), garnished with sliced red onion, lime and pickled vegetables. \u00a0All of these dishes can be made with a spiciness range from 1-10. \u00a0We ordered a 7 for all and the smoke was perfect...I could have gone to an 8, but it was a perfect dish at 7. \u00a0Do NOT eat the little red peppers in the dish or have water ready. \u00a0Ice water. \u00a0Oh, we also ordered the Thai Tea. \u00a0Very refreshing. \u00a0They do not have coffee there. \u00a0Well, they do have instant, but is that really coffee, is it?Oh man...the La Piste de resistance is really the sample platter dessert. \u00a0It's comprised of Coconut ice cream, Sticky rice with Mango's (if you like the salty sweet thing then this is your thing), and Fried banana rolls drizzled with honey. \u00a0Menu diva at it again...we were full so didn't want a Cheesecake Factory sized dessert. \u00a0Joe hooked up a sample Sampler for us. \u00a0The very sweet dessert maker delivered it for us and reaffirmed that it was made smaller for us. \u00a0It was sill plenty of food though. \u00a0( I promised my friend I would not mention that she ate 75% of each plate, though she claims more of a 50 50 split. \u00a0Hey, I'm not mad at her. A gurl's gotta eat, right?) \u00a0 Our bill for the two of us was less than $50 and we got our grub and drink on big...well, at least she did...kidding of course...kind of...OKAY...I am kidding. \u00a0We both ate good.When I first moved here in 2001, I discovered Lotus of Siam listening to NPR. \u00a0The were saying how Gourmet Magazine chooses the top 10 restaurants in LV every year and every year, Lotus of Siam is selected. \u00a0How can one resist right? \u00a0The food was not awe inspiring, but I would not kick it out of bed for eating crackers either. \u00a0The food was 3 stars, the Service was 5 stars so I took an average of the two...(3+5)/2) is equal to 8/2 which equals 4...just in case...Alrighty then!!!Enjoy!Chow!", "Date": "2010-04-11", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Brian S.", "ReviewID": "miOHI2RoPJnWyVowk3rEFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hit this place with a date.

Unlike most Thai restaurants, they use a thinner and skinnier noodle which actually absorbs the peanut sauce a lot better because of the greater surface area AND it's chewey which deserves my love and affection.3rd Place: all other food items.

From the reviews, I was expecting Lotus to blow my mind - and it didn't.

It was pretty salty. The first few bites were really good, after that, the flavor kicked in and it was hard to eat. Unique dish though, never had it before.3) Drunken Noodles with Crispy Duck - Crispy duck topped with homemade fresh chili and Thai basil. Serve on the top of pan fried flat rice noodle. - $21.95 : this dish was GOOD, it could have used more noodles though - they gave us enough for one person, hardly enough for 2 people to share. Most people want more meat - and here we wanted more noodles, they gave us a good amount of crispy duck though. The flavors blended together perfectly. Would def. recommend this dish. 4) Thai Iced tea - $2.50 each : the tea taste was stronger than any other Thai tea I've had - so if you're really into tea - that's a good thing. I'm not into that strong taste so I handed it over to my bf.Dinner came out to be $42 exactly before tip. So if you get these dishes, expect to spend about $50. and that's with no dessert. =(The best Thai restaurant in North America? I have to disagree. It's ok, but definitely not the best.

When a restaurant is heralded as the best Thai food in North America, it has to be good. Only down side was my expectations going in were sky high. However it really says something when not only was I not let down but my expectations were actually exceeded. I've heard that everything on the menu is great and so far that's true although some things are a bit more amazing than others. I've been here twice so far, and both times have ordered number #14 on the appetizer menu. I can't remember the exact name of it but I refer to it as crispy rice salad. One of the best dishes I can remember getting in a long time. The menu is very long and has a bigger variety than most typical Thai restaurants so you might need some guidance. On my first visit, the server recommended Sea Bass Drunken Noodles. I saw a prior reviewer mention it was \"like crack\" and I would have to agree with them. The Sea Bass was very tender and the noodles and sauce were very flavorful. The next time I came, I forced myself to try something different. The server recommended some sort of noodle dish that was more like soup. It was still good but I definitely preferred the drunken noodles to it. But really, seems like you can't go wrong with almost anything here.We actually tried to come to Lotus of Siam several years ago but we thought we were in the wrong place since the center its in looks a bit run down, to put it nicely. So if you have never been here, be forewarned. Once you enter however, the place looks legit. Take a glance at all the pictures of celebrities and famous chefs who have dined here to convince you.My only complaint is that they are not open for lunch on weekends. Since its location is a bit out of the way, it's more convenient to come to for lunch and I would guarantee I'd be here on every Vegas trip if I could come in for lunch on a Saturday or Sunday. On my last week Vegas trip, I literally scheduled my trip around a lunch visit here by going on a long weekend and staying through Monday.

New stuff including Thai. I have had Thai before so I am not a total neophyte. A friend and I decided to go out and had heard great reviews about Lotus of Siam. I Googled them, of course, to see what we were in for. I saw the words \"Extended Wine Selection\" and was immediately on board. The location is not the best in Vegas as the Commercial Center (yes, that is the actual name of the strip mall) has seen better days. Parking was plentiful and the restaurant was easy to find. Walking in, it seemed a little small until we entered the main dining room saddled by a giant wine cellar. The decor looked better suited for a mid 1990's country club, and was sort of all over the place, but not kitschy or themed which I appreciated.  \u00a0 The moment we were sat, waiters sort of came out of nowhere to bring us plates, water and cutlery. Extended wine selection is an understatement. The wine menu is larger than the food menu. I chose a cabernet on the lower end of the price scale as I am no Rockefeller and was pleased with it. Most impressive was the two wines that were ordered came in the appropriate glasses. One red and one white. (This is rare).  \u00a0 Once ordered, the food was brought to us very quickly. I ordered the Seafood Fried Rice and my friend ordered the Mint and Green Chili Beef (spiced at a level 9 out of 10). I was surprised at the serving size we were given for an entree priced just north of $10. I was full at the end of the meal with no appetizers or desserts. (Also rare). My friend, being more of a Thai food junkie than myself was satisfied that \"this place wasn't messing around\" when it came to spice. Apparently, many restaurants fall short in this department. The seafood tasted wonderful in the fried rice and included shrimp, crab, calamari and scallops.  \u00a0 The noise level was average, I didn't feel like everyone could hear our conversation, and try as I might, I couldn't eavesdrop on anyone else.

I did get some tips on eating it afterwards from our very helpful server.o Green Dip with Chile and Mushroom. This was a surprise. It was a small bowl of what tasted similar to Hatch-style green chiles, with mushrooms, in a vinegar & spice sauce, with carrots and cucumbers for dipping / scooping. Very southwesty... in fact, the sort of thing you might see on the menu at some creative Santa Fe caf\u00e9. Except it's a native northern Thai dish! Total winner.None of these were mind-blowing dishes by themselves, but they were awesome in that they were different from anywhere else. This food is authentic (or at least not Americanized), it's cheap, the staff were great.

I'll admit - I'm an Asian soup noodle guy. \u00a0Love the pho, wonton soup, beef stew, and ramen. \u00a0This is a nice dish that holds its own with the greats. \u00a0Beef, meatballs, noodles, fragrant broth, and garnished with fried pork skin. \u00a0Good portion at a very reasonable price. \u00a0Our Pad Thai tasted great, but the portion size was about half of what I remember them serving in the past. \u00a0Since we were all sharing dishes, it wasn't a huge deal, but it would take at least 2 of these orders to equal what you would get at most other Thai restaurants in town. \u00a0 \u00a0 The whole Thai BBQ chicken was meh. \u00a0Seasoning was okay, but I'm guessing it had been left over from lunch (or earlier), as it came out of the kitchen at room temperature only 3-4 minutes after ordering it together with the duck (and before our appetizer). \u00a0It had that \"stale chicken\" texture that old supermarket rotisserie chicken has towards the end of the night when it's sat under the heat lamps for too many hours and becomes mealy. \u00a0Although it's cut into pieces, the chicken is somewhat small. \u00a0Not humanely raised tasty farm chicken small though. \u00a0The parts look like they came from a 22-24oz Cornish game hen.My biggest disappointment of the evening came to the table in the form of panang crispy duck. \u00a0This used to be my favorite dish and I was really looking forward to it. \u00a0When the entree came out, it was a fraction of the size of its former self. \u00a0The duck was not fried to order and the panang did not have the same richness and depth that it used to. \u00a0Was it horrible? \u00a0No. \u00a0Would I order it again? \u00a0Absolutely not. \u00a0I asked the server about the portion size of not only this dish, but the rest of them as well and he replied that they all appeared to be fine. \u00a0I asked why the duck portion had shrunk so much and he informed me that the portion was only supposed to be 1/4 of a duck. \u00a0He said that he hadn't worked there very long but it's been that way as long as he'd worked there. \u00a01/4 of a duck with totally unremarkable panang for $25? \u00a0Yikes! \u00a0It used to be a whole roasted duck, butterflied, de-boned, and then flash fried to order for that price.The verdict? \u00a0Completely average food, small portions, and big prices. \u00a0From now on, I'll be heading over to Spring Mt to get my Thai food fix when I'm in Las Vegas. \u00a0I have to wonder what sort of horrible Thai food that the other reviewers on here are eating which causes them to give LOS 5 stars? \u00a0Oh, how I yearn for the days when LOS was a small hole in the wall and there was still a wig shop next door.The good news out of all of this? \u00a0The gay bar at the entrance of the Commercial Center called Spotlight (which has always been and is still very straight friendly) received a full remodel inside and out recently. \u00a0Service is fantastic and well drinks and beer are still 2 for $4 during happy hour. \u00a0So, if your heart's set on overhyped mediocre Thai food, you can still grab a drink next door while waiting for your table.", "Date": "2013-04-05", "Author_Location": "Phoenix, AZ"}, {"Author": "Albert W.", "ReviewID": "vfxN3gcc2cOlkqrL8f9hrw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Is it the best thai restaurant in the US? \u00a0 Hmm... it definitely is one of the most expensive BUT for that price, you can taste that it is a notch above all the other thai restaurants. \u00a0 We had something like Mi krop with sour sausages (one of their top 3 most popular), sea bass on top of drunken noodles (also another top 3 most popular), minced jackfruit with pork (something different since you don't usually see that) and sticky rice with mango. \u00a0 Now.... the thing is that I've had almost all these dishes at other thai restaurants. \u00a0Each one of the dishes were slightly better (more sour, more greens, better quality fish, better cooking technique, in season fruits, garnishes you can eat, no fillers) \u00a0than at my favorite places in Thaitown in Hollywood, CA. \u00a0 \u00a0 The owner here.... tons of people waiting and the bums in the parking lot asking for money. \u00a0 Would I recommend a visit.... \u00a0 definitely -- only a few places in the US that you can eat at a James Beard award winner that is reasonable in price.", "Date": "2010-09-22", "Author_Location": "Avocado Heights, CA"}, {"Author": "Mark F.", "ReviewID": "NWLN3gIc1HfAWtMQPW9N_g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had thai food all over the world and this is as good as any there is. \u00a0Add a world class selection of wine and this is as sure a bet there is in Vegas!", "Date": "2012-01-09", "Author_Location": "Newhall, CA"}, {"Author": "Brenda B.", "ReviewID": "E_W4utVMw-E0HhGFabF1mw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hadn't ate here in years, but I thought it was the best.

I wasn't familiar with much of the menu, and many dishes had oyster sauce of which I'm allergic to, but the waiter was patient and understanding and gave us some suggestions.

Big pieces of chicken and tons of mushrooms and tomato !! Next came the chicken satay, very tasty !! Than the crying tiger , thinly sliced beef it was awesome but served cold, ( as I'm not familiar with the dish, it is said that that is how it normally is served) but could have used a little warmth for my taste! Very soon our entree arrived basil crispy pork!! I could just die!! It was awesome! I requested no oyster sauce and they said they cooked it in soy sauce and chili sauce!! But the flavor was absolutely amazing!! Also the green curry was great , a little to sweet for my taste, but request the chili tray , so u can spice things up to your liking, my friend micheal ordered the minced chicken 15 star spicy, which I didn't try , but made my friend cry!!

With accolades like that, I tend to have high expectations.... Expectations that were not met.When you arrive at Lotus of Siam, it looks just like every other Thai restaurant found in any old town. It appears to be made up of several converted spaces that makes it feel like a Bingo hall. There are water damage stains on the ceiling where crystal chandeliers from the early 80's hang under fluorescent lights. Dusty framed pieces of art depicting elephants drawn with sequins adorn the walls. It really couldn't be any more of a cliche. Then there was the menu. Inundated with over 150 items, I was enormously overwhelmed by the task at hand. Luckily, the website lists a number of recommendations within each course. So we went with the Koong Sarong or \"Prawn in Blanket.\" This dish featured marinated prawns wrapped with bacon and wonton wraps, deep fried, and served with homemade sweet and sour sauce. Was it good? Of course! It was amazing! But what isn't when wrapped in bacon and deep fried. The prawns were done just right and the sauce balanced out the heaviness of the wonton nicely.They say that the true test of a brilliant chef is to order the simplest menu item and see how they are able to make it their own. It seemed like a reasonable challenge, but not so much that night. I went with my old standby Pad Thai and couldn't wait to see what Chef Saipin Chutima would do. Unfortunately, I was sadly underwhelmed. The dish tasted okay, but I had seen this dozens of times before. It was by no means a revelation. In fact, it was overly oily and too sweet. My companions ordered Charbroiled Beef which was very grisly, and while the Sweet and Sour Chicken was nice and fresh, the use of cilantro was overpowering and just too much. It could very well be that we just did not order the right menu items. But in my opinion, any item coming out of such a heralded kitchen should be cooked to perfection. My advice: save up and splurge at a \"Strip\" restaurant such as Shibuya at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. It will cost a bit more but the experience will be worth it.

When we drove into the shopping center, we were wondering what we had gotten ourselves into. It was located in a strip mall which looked pretty deserted. We had also looked up Komol, which is right across from Lotus of Siam, but were intrigued by the reviews of this place. The place is not impressive looking from the outside, but when you step inside...totally different! We happened to come by when Las Vegas Magazine was there doing a review, which was pretty cool to see. I ordered the vegetarian Tom Yum (spicy vegetable soup) which was good! It's rare to find this in a cup size, so I was eager to try it. My friend and I both ordered the Vegetarian Drunken Noodle, which isn't on the menu, but asked that it be made as I am a vegetarian. I mentioned to the waiter that we had read awesome reviews from yelp and that we were from California. A few minutes later, an appetizer comes to our table...compliments of the manager. It was the veggie version of their \"Nam Kao Tod\" and it had tofu in it instead. The flavor was amazing, the lime juice brought out the flavors in the dish so well! Then, the manager brought over 2 glasses of wine to taste with the appetizer and he paired them nicely! When the main dish arrived (Veggie Drunken Noodle), I was practically full already. The dish had amazing color to it (please see my pic's of this dish in the photos above) with lots of tofu, FRESH veggies, and noodles. It was the BEST drunken noodle dish I've ever tasted. The service at this place was OUTSTANDING and we also noticed that the people dining behind us received the same service as well. We opted for the Sticky rice and coconut ice cream for dessert. OMG!!! My mouth is watering thinking about this delicious dessert. The coconut was so soft and young, and the rice was the perfect addition to compliment this. Again, 2 more glasses of wine appear and this time, it's my absolute favorite dessert wine, Muscato d'Asti. When the bill came, NO charge for the appetizer or the wine! The manager came over to our table and was incredibly gracious and a true gentleman. When we walked outside, he ran after us to make sure we weren't going to be hailing a cab, as the location is pretty remote and no cab's were in sight. We had a rental car, so we were set. Talk about going that extra mile! When we asked him how his competition was across the way (Komol is another Thai restaurant in the same lot), not one bad thing came out of his mouth and he said \"No, we don't compete with other restaurants, we like that we're a small place.\" How cool was that? My friend and I vowed that every time we go to Vegas, we will definitely come back to this gem of a place. For anyone who loves Thai, ya gotta check it out when you're in Vegas.

The waiters, even the hosts, really know their food. If you ask, they will recommend the best, and it truly is the best. I did visit their ladies restroom and I was very surprised to see a fabulously clean and well groomed restroom. Soap, toilet paper..everything was stocked.

And most folks who eat here love it. Having said that, I just don't get Lotus of Siam. Sure, it's good; the curries are balanced and the salads, and noodle dishes are tasty, but I feel that this is a place that is more concerned with it's reputation as the premier Thai restaurant in the area than the menu. They have tailored their dishes for farang, (foreign), meaning our milder, \u00a0palates. What is with the wine obsession? I have never experienced a Thai restaurant anywhere that directs such focus on wine. Not that it's a bad thing, I personally enjoy a glass of Pinot Grigio with a Glass Noodle Salad, for example, but it comes off to me as a little snobbish. The staff are courteous, but seem harried and too busy. The service is good, but I like to chat in Thai to my server and or hostess, and they just don't seem to have the time. Those who are seeking authentic Thai food should try some of the other Thai restaurants in town. Each one is different and I don't really have a favorite, although the beef salad at Pin Kaow is excellent, the curries at Komol Kitchen are mind blowing, (the pastes are made from scratch), and the Larb at Ocha is the best I've ever had anywhere! Order it with sticky rice. There are a few Thai places in Vegas I've not tried, mostly because of their location relative to my home, but for my money, eating Thai means enjoying the personality of the restaurant, the proprietor, & the food. In these areas, Lotus of Siam is little better than average, and the lunch buffet is the only thing I eat there if I'm on my lunch break and am in need of a quick Thai fix.

We were party of 3, two Asians and one Caucasian. We had reservations for dinner and were seated promptly. \u00a0 We love Southeast Asian food and have been to lots of Thai, Laotian, Burmese restaurants in California and Asia. \u00a0There were about 100 other diners in the restaurant when we arrived. There were many things that ended up being unique about this restaurant, unfortunately the quality of the food was not one of them. First, about 99% of clientele was Caucasian. This is never a good sign at an Asian restaurant. Everyone had a bottle of wine at their table. That's another oddity at an Asian restaurant. \u00a0Despite these two warning signs, we still felt we would be in for a great experience, based on yelp reviews. \u00a0We really weren't looking for ambiance, wine or decor. We were looking for \"the best Thai food in the US, as promised in these reviews. \u00a0We ordered the Northern Thai soup, which was ok but not balanced and way too heavy on fish sauce. \u00a0We had Nam Prik Onn, chili dip, which is a peasant dish popular in Northern Thailand and Burma. It usually \u00a0contains a bit of meat or fish in a very salty sauce into which vegetables are dipped. \u00a0It's eaten because meat and protein are rare and expensive in parts of thailand and Burma. \u00a0It gives a bit of taste to cheap veggie meals. \u00a0Here it was 10 bucks for a few tablespoons of something that tasted like middle america spaghetti sauce, a few vegetables to dip, and a handful of packaged chicharones (pork rinds) straight from the chips section of the local supermarket. We had Laotian style papaya salad, which was good. We also had crispy duck in chili mint sauce, deep fried fish in chili sauce, northern thai sausage. \u00a0 We also had a combination dessert with coconut ice cream, sticky rice, mango, and banana wrapped in wonton wraps and deep fried. \u00a0Overall food was acceptable. Nothing was great. We had to add another dish at the end because we were still hungry at the end, portions were so small. No drinks except water. Bill came to $120 for 3 people.

We went to a fantastic Laos / Northeastern Thai restaurant in East Oakland California a month ago and had almost the same things, with much better quality and larger portions for $39! \u00a0Of course there wasn't the huge wine selection, but who goes to a Thai restaurant for wine.
