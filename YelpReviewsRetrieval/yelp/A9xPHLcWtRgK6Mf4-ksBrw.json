Let me tell you that Bloody Mary was possibly the best i have had!! We ordered the famed seafood gumbo for our appetizer, and I ordered the shrimp/oyster combo po'boy, and my wife the blackened chicken po'boy. The gumbo was perfect, and our sandwiches delicious. Mine was chock full of oysters and shrimp, and my wife couldn't finish hers there was so much chicken. In fact, at the vacations end she said that was the best thing she ate our whole trip !I strongly reccomend dining here ! Its a bit of a hike from the French Quarter, but its worth it!

Went here based on a recommendation from a friend and this was by far the worst dining experience we have had since we have been in New Orleans. We were seated at a larger, communal table and ordered drinks. After getting our drinks, we were told we would need to move to another table next to us, so a group of 8 could sit together. Not a huge deal, but the staff could have asked us if we minded moving (which of course was not a problem) rather than telling us that we had to move. That made it annoying. Cleanliness was also an issue here. A trip to the bathroom made me question whether to even eat the food, as cockroaches were present. I get that the place is old, but it felt as if there were layers of grime on everything. I'm definitely not the kind of person that is picky about only eating in clean restaurants, and I'd have been willing to overlook the dirty atmosphere if the food had actually been good, but it wasn't. We ordered the smoked duck quesadilla (recommended by a friend), and it was very tasty. We also ordered the fried chicken, oyster po boy and jambalaya. The fried chicken was legit. Perfectly crispy. However, our order was small compared to the same size order the couple seated next to us received. A staff member who brought us our food had long hair hanging in his face and no hair net, and had headphones in, both of which seemed unprofessional in my opinion. The jambalaya was disgusting. Tasted as if it had been sitting all day and was way overly spiced and not in a good, flavorful spice way. I would not go back or recommend this place.

So our food comes and everything looks great. I ordered the Cajun fried chicken which comes with lamb/ sausage jambalaya and cole slaw, and everyone else ordered shrimp Po boys. The jambalaya was very good...spicy yes but still very good. I was worried it was going to taste \"gamey\"because of the rabbit but it instead tasted like..well let's just say it had the texture of chicken. My chicken was bland and dry. I couldn't eat it because it was so dry! I couldn't taste anything Cajun or spicy on the chicken so I just left it on the plate. Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food so I guess they do Po boys and jambalaya right. It's funny how I've had 3 different taste of jambalaya since I've been to New Orleans. I guess everyone has their own interpretation of how it's supposed to taste. All in all it was cool. Except for the table full of drunk frat boys behind us.

The first time, I got the upgrade to include tasso ham and shrimp and it was phenomenal. But the second time I had it plain and it was just ok. Too much tomato-y flavor for me. I expected more of a cajun flavor rather than a creole tomato base from such a place. Also, without the upgrade, there just aren't any solid chunks of meat. The second time we went, we ordered the tasting plate which comes with seafood gumbo, fried chicken, jambalaya, red beans and rice with sausage, and shrimp creole. The gumbo was amazing. \u00a0The shrimp creole was watery, but still had a kick and the red beans and rice was ok. The chicken and jambalaya supreme are really the stars.

The divey atmosphere wasn't a problem.The creole shrimp was basically bland spaghetti-O's-like sauce poured on \u00a0overcooked shrimp. I had to pour a lot of tobasco on it to give it any kick.

We'd read reviews here that this was the spot for good authentic Cajun eats, and found that to be true-ish. Had a few issues with it though. First of all, perhaps regulars are familiar with the arrangement, but their method of seating is extremely confusing. People were lined up outside the door when we arrived around 8pm, so we asked one of them and were told that yes, we need to line up, so we did, behind about 3 groups of people. About 10min later, the hostess came out the door and yelled \"two people!\" and nobody in the line replied, so she yelled it again. Confused, I offered \"um, we're two people\" and she yelled \"well speak up jeez!\" and vanished into the restaurant. We tried following her in, still confused, but making the assumption that a table for two was up. We noticed her over along the wall at an empty 2-seater gesturing for us to hurry up, so we sat down. Again, still a bit confused. Had we just cut in front of the other people outside? Is this a normal way of seating people? We just sat down, shrugged, and started looking at the menu. During our meal, we saw many other confused people who came into the restaurant (if there were no people waiting in line outside you'd naturally just enter the restaurant) only to get yelled at to wait in line outside.... Just weird. Has Coop's ever heard of maybe putting up a sign??? We looked around when leaving for such a sign, but nope. Do they think visitors to NOLA are psychic, or enjoy feeling confused and getting yelled at?? Terrible. As for the venue, it's a gross, dirty dive. I'm still undecided on how I feel about this fact. The table was sticky, the menus were sticky, the floor hadn't been mopped in about 20 years, and the restrooms... yikes. They're out back, in an actual alley, and bring back horrible memories of a porta-potty at a state fair. But as a bonus, while you squat over the wobbly toilet to pee, you can smell the delicious Cajun aromas of the jambalaya they cook out there, in the back alley, in a big barrel, 20 feet from the toilets. Gross, or authentic? Still undecided. An lady waiting behind me for the restroom was incredulous at the nastiness and told me she was leaving and that I should too, so there's that. The food was decent, but nothing amazing. Yes, it's authentic from what I could tell, but I do suspect that they could make authentic, delicious food in a cleaner environment!! We had the duck quesadilla, which was actually terrible and tasteless and hard with little to no discernible duck meat. And we had the jambalaya pasta, which was quite delicious.

You have to stop by for the best meal in New Orleans,\" they would command. Of course we did, having such delicacies as Blackend Redfish and outrageous gumbo; truly, a fantastic meal that I still remember to this day.

Fast Forward \u00a0another year and my Jambalaya is a sticky, over spiced mess, and oh yes, there is some real attitude to go along with that average meal.

The fried chicken is outstanding, my southern-born girlfriend pronounced it the best she's ever had. The gumbo - the seafood and/or chicken/sausage - is a must-order we tore those up then quibbled over whether to hit it again or order more chicken. She won, we got a chicken breast.

The jambalaya is a bit sweeter tasting than most. That don't make it bad, as a matter of fact jambalaya tastes different nearly every place you eat it. Wash your tongue with a local brew, Abilla, pairs extraordinarily well with creole flavors. Especially the Amber. We paid our compliments to the chef, who told us he's been cooking for three decades.

Everything in New Orleans is old, so I expected nothing modern about this place and that's part of it's charm. You know it's been around awhile and the food did not disappoint! The service was quick, but it was also slow because we went around noon on a Wednesday. I usually have a saying that when a restaurant is slow, the service is worse because they are off their game. That wasn't the case with Coops! Our waitress was on top of everything and made sure we were taken care of. I had the rabbit jambalaya - amazing! Now I've never eaten rabbit before, but it was delicious and moist, and there were huge chunks in the dish. I'm just starting to get into spicy food, so this was a tad spicy for my taste but I still loved it. The heat in it builds, so at first it doesn't seem bad, but after a few minutes you'll feel the heat kick in more, so just be wary if you are new to spicy food! My husband got a chef salad with shrimp and loved his meal as well. Our friend, not a cajun food fan, got alfredo pasta with chicken and said it was excellent. His meal came with a huge piece of breaded chicken, not just a few pieces cut up in the pasta. I washed the jambalaya down with the just released for the season Abita strawberry. OH! And trust me when I tell you this...get a side of creole green beans in the bacon sauce. IT WAS AMAZING! But isn't everything when it comes to adding bacon?

On that occasion, the service was friendly and the food was fantastic. Well, that was ten years ago and Coop's has changed! For my trip to N.O. in 2013, I was so excited to bring my travel companion to the casual, friendly place I remembered. When we arrived around 10:45p.m. there was a line of about 6 people at the door. This was a little unexpected, but not discouraging. After a few minutes, I peered into the bar/restaurant window and saw 2 empty 4 tops and 3 empty 2 tops; enough room to seat 14 people. In addition, the bar was half empty. Hmmm. I commented to the gal in front of me that it was a little strange to be waiting outside when there are several empty seats. The girl answered angrily, \"I know, right?!!\"The waitress came out a couple times to verify how many are in each party, but insisted we stay outside. After about 5 minutes, 2 people left and at about 8 minutes we were let in. After being seated, the waitress (who also acted as a bartender) did not come around for drink orders until about 8-10 minutes after seating us. She was abrupt and somewhat rude when taking the orders, but softened a little when she discovered we weren't the impatient and demanding tourists that maybe she was expecting.We ordered the crab stuffed jalapenos, Coop's taste plate and Redfish Meuniere. The Jalapenos were soggy and the crab stuffing bland. Plus, they were luke warm. The taste plate was not any better. The red beans and rice were incredibly bland; the rabbit Jambalaya was mushy and tasteless; and the shrimp creole dull. According to the certificate on the wall, Coop's has the best gumbo in New Orleans, but the gumbo on our table was watery and flat with little seafood. My Redfish was better, however. The fish was cooked perfectly, moist and firm. The meuniere sauce was not traditional as they added worcestershire sauce and some other seasonings to the usual butter, wine and lemon recipe. The flavors melded well, but the cook put a bit too much worcestershire and it over- powered the other ingredients. My friend and I finished less than half our meal because we did not find the food to be appetizing. Our waitress did stop by once to check on us, but again, her demeanor wasn't exactly friendly. It seems that the locals get better treatment, but it is to be expected since some tourists are unpleasant and the sheer volume of people coming into this place must be taxing, particularly when the place seems to be understaffed.

What little space the restaurant had to offer in the first place was crowded with tables, offering just enough space for one person to squeeze between seats at a time. Our waiter/bartender appeared disinterested and wasn't the friendliest, but he came through (asking whether we needed another drink, refilling water, etc.) in a timely fashion. Other waiters/waitresses were very genial - perhaps our guy was having an off day.While Coop's was completely filled, our food was served rather quickly (in less than 20 minutes). I ordered the jambalaya supreme and found it to be quite good and very filling. The dish was spicy and zesty but not overly salty or rich.

So maybe it'll be better for the next folks who visit. I don't know; I don't plan on finding out for myself.Other annoying, but fun facts:-If you pay by credit card you can only put it on one card... no splitting of the check-There are random bits of art which are cool, but sometimes ironic; one reads \"BE NICE OR STARVE.\" ... which was particularly great, to me, since I feel that philosophy should apply to the waitstaff-- be nice to your customers or get minimal/no tip!!!", "Date": "2013-02-15", "Author_Location": "Decatur, GA"}, {"Author": "Angela Y.", "ReviewID": "GrdTRWgr0KD6OPUu0D2b_g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We originally wanted to come for late night food, but ended up being too full from oysters at Acme.

Now, I live in NYC, and he lives in LA. I haven't seen him in months, haven't spoken to him in weeks, I had no idea he was going to be in NOLA, and this is a complete, crazy coincidence. Are you fucking kidding me. I hit him and say, \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" Turns out he was in town for HALF A DAY, and he had to stop by Coop's to get some jambalaya. THAT'S how good it is. And I just happened to be there too at the same EXACT FREAKING TIME. Coop's Jambalaya; reuniting friends from coast to coast._________The selection is not limited to jambalaya, however. Anything they fry is about as good as it gets. Also, the booze is nice and cheap! Good beers (Newcastle, Restoration Ale) are $3.50, Laphroig is $6, Lagavulin and Hendrick's are $7.

What got me off on the wrong foot is that soon after arriving, I had to use the rest room. \u00a0There are two but one of them was out of commission. \u00a0The lone bathroom that remained was gross. \u00a0 My thought has long been that if you can't keep your bathrooms clean, then what does your kitchen look like? \u00a0Overall, everything else in the place including our table seemed like it could have used a good scrubbing. \u00a0 With bleach. \u00a0 Not a good start.As well, there was a staff person moving several fully loaded trash barrels from behind the back of the bar to somewhere else, presumably to empty them, each time passing our table with the overflowing barrels. \u00a0The next thing I knew this same guy, who was not our waiter, served us our food. \u00a0It wasn't a great connection...from bare-handed garbage hauler to food server.For an appetizer, we got the crabmeat stuffed jalapeno peppers. \u00a0These were pretty good with a slight kick. Not quite enough kick for me but I didn't dare use the crusty-capped bottle of hot sauce on the table.I ordered the fried shrimp and fried crawfish combo on French bread. It came with fries. \u00a0The French bread was crisp and fresh. \u00a0The fried shrimp were good but nothing spectacular. I felt the crawfish went to waste because after all the breading and frying you couldn't discern what it was that you were eating. \u00a0Empty calories there. \u00a0If I'm going to pile on the calories, I want to thoroughly enjoy every last one of them.For drinks we ordered Bloody Marys which the neighbors again raved about. \u00a0Sorry again...way too thick...almost tomato paste-y and way too much Worcestershire sauce. \u00a0My next drink was the local Abita beer which I like a lot.Things were tasty enough I suppose, nothing was incredible and certainly our \u00a0particular meals didn't match the very high praise from our neighbors.

The restaurant certainly isn't much to look at, or sit in for that matter, but the food is definitely what keeps the line out the door on a regular basis. The locals come here too, which is always a good sign, particularly in a tourist mecca like New Orleans.Food: Coop's specializes in traditional cajun/creole fare. During my visit, I opted for the cajun fried chicken, which was seasoned with the restaurant's delicious Bayou Blend and served alongside rabbit and sausage jambalaya and coleslaw. The chicken was excellent, but the jambalaya was extraordinary - in fact, it was arguably among the top three renditions of the dish that I've ever ingested. Due to the price point, I wasn't expecting much rabbit meat, but it was certainly generously portioned in the serving that I received. The coleslaw was fairly standard, but well-prepared nonetheless.Service: Apparently this place has a reputation for having snarky staff, but that wasn't my experience - perhaps it's because I don't make a habit of being a pain in the ass to waitstaff. Upon our arrival around noon on a Saturday, we were promptly seated and attended to throughout the meal. The waitress was very cordial and more than willing to answer any questions that we had.Atmosphere: If this place doesn't classify as a dive bar, then I'm not really sure what does. The interior is darker than a dungeon and the walls are lined with tongue-in-cheek wall art containing statements like \"Be nice or starve\" and \"shut up and eat\". The tables are somewhat cramped, but the service is quick, so the situation isn't unbearable. Dress is casual and clientele is a mixture of locals and tourists.Cost: Inexpensive, particularly considering the quality and quantity of the food. Appetizers are $6-$10, sandwiches are $7-$10, entrees are $8-$13, and sides are $3-$5.Other: Reservations are not accepted, so be prepared to wait during peak dining hours - there is no waiting area inside the restaurant, so if there's no room at the bar, you'll be relegated to stand outside.

Enter Peanut the giant bulldog (and his gf another large bulldog) I mean this thing must be 40+ lbs at least, and what was Peanut doing you might ask? \u00a0Climbing right under our table over our feet. \u00a0Before I saw the bundle of fur I figured some trashy parent lost a child and it was crawling under tables. \u00a0I'm a dog lover but in a restaurant? \u00a0I don't know it's not really something I would expect.Now despite my friend's and my obvious mental handicaps the food was pretty good. \u00a0We had fried chicken, which was mouthwatering, and the coleslaw was good. The gumboesque casserole would have been good too but by the time our superstar got to the table it was that disturbing luke warm temperature. \u00a0 All in all whether or not you have the best creole in town (which you don't) I would say it's customary to respect your customers. \u00a0Unless they are into sadism of course but then maybe you should beat them with whips and chains to really complete the experience.", "Date": "2010-12-20", "Author_Location": "Dallas, TX"}, {"Author": "Justine C.", "ReviewID": "L3FHy3Fc9ndhmy33X58e_A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I start my review on Coop's I need to comment/vent on a previous 1-star review I read about this place complaining about a cat: \"NEVER AGAIN......this place is SO Unsanitary!

Outstanding. The bloody mary and coffee I had were absolutely delicious. The jambalaya supreme is why you should come here though. Don't order anything else.

You were hot and muggy. I sweat a lot. I also ate a ton and came back (much) heavier... which was the point, anyway. Dinner at Coop's Place was a spontaneous decision. We had walked to another restaurant recommended in my handy-dandy \"New Orleans FOR DUMMIES\" and lo behold, we'd forgotten to make sure that the place was open. That restaurant is apparently a breakfast-brunch place, but we did get quite an exercise walking from Canal Street (stop: Elk Pl) and went alllllll the way to Esplanade. Anyway. We were tired and hungry. And hot. And hungry. So we yelped and found this little place. Now, my food opinions are based on taste as I know next to nothing about Southern cuisine. The rabbit and sausage jambalaya was okay. I didn't like the rabbit, which I thought was sort of the point of the dish. The fried platter of fried crab, oysters, and shrimp: delicious, but that may be because I love fried food. One of my \"MUST HAVE DRINKS\" was the Sazerac - rye whiskey and some nasty licorice tasting stuff.. Now I can say that I've had it, but can't say I've found the reason why it's so adored. The service was pretty bad. It was a Sunday night and it wasn't so busy when we stepped inside. We found ourselves seats... and waited. Maybe I felt the server's absence more keenly as I was thirsty as hell and wanted some water, but we waited a good ten minutes before a random waiter noticed we were sitting... looking pretty and... without ...anything. We finally ordered (in his defense, he did tell me the Sazerac was gross stuff) and then, notified us that he lost our order a good fifteen minutes after the ordering. So then we waited longer. Hmm..

\u00a0Seeing that it would take a while to get our food, we decided to put in an additional order of fried chicken because we didn't think we ordered enough food. \u00a0My Buddy waves Cary down and politely asks him about our existing order and requests an additional dark meat order of chicken. \u00a0Cary responds that he'll check on our order.Finally Cary returns another 10 minutes later with our chicken. \u00a0He brings us two plates of white meat chicken and one dark meat. \u00a0We noticed it right away and brought it to his attention that we had ordered 2 darks, and one white. \u00a0This Hot Shot insists that we put in 3 orders of white and 1 dark meat. \u00a0This was ridiculous since everyone at our table preferred dark meat, and the white meat order was for me.Instead of admitting his mistake, Cary makes up the most ridiculous policy I've ever heard. \u00a0He said: \"At this time, we can't take anymore dark or white meat orders. \u00a0You just get what you get.\" \u00a0WTF is that??I haven't been here before, but again, I proceed to give this incompetent idiot the benefit of the doubt, and accept the wrong order. \u00a0We begin fuming when minutes later we overhear him and another waitress take other people's orders of DARK MEAT chicken without issue or mention of any so-called 'chicken-policy.'Whatever. \u00a0We were over it. \u00a0Finally we asked him for extra plates since we were sharing. \u00a0This @sshole replies with: \"let me see if we have any clean plates in the back.\"This Dimwit returns a minute later and tells us: \"Sorry, we're all out of clean plates.\"Are you F-ing kidding me?

It's not too crispy (as Church's chicken happens to be), beautifully browned, and perfectly spiced. And the perfect amount of greasy without being offensive. Yes, I realize how weird that sentence is. ANYWAYS, I got the taste plate during my first visit at Coop's, which includes one piece of fried chicken, and I knew I would have to go back for more. And I did. This place is also a bar.

The atmosphere is casual and charmingly scruffy but certainly clean enough. Tables are made of wood and the lighting is pleasingly on the dim side. The staff, many of whom have worked there for many years, serve you with a great classically New Orleans friendly, but slightly gruff attitude. I never wait for a beer, my water glass is always full, and if I decide to veer from the half dozen things I usually order the staff always has great and honest suggestions.The food is phenomenal and for the price is it ridiculously amazing. My favorite dishes are the perfectly spicy and smokey crawfish and tasso pasta and the glorious combination of super delicious goodness, the pasta Opelousas. The fried oysters are always cooked to perfection and the duck quesadillas offer a wonderful sweet-spicy unique flavor. \u00a0If ordering the jambalaya be sure to get it \"supreme\" style.

Our 1st time walking by, it was packed & there was a very long line out the door. We weren't in the mood for waiting so we decided to come back later, but a long line is always a sign of good food, right?The next day, around 2 in the afternoon, the scene was the same. Oh well, what the Hell, we queued up for our chance to get \"a true taste of New Orleans.\"* After standing around for 20 minutes, I decided to take a look inside while the girlfriend held our place in line.All the tables were full, but 1/2 the seats at the bar were empty. Food is served at the bar, so why the Hell are there open seats inside when there is a line outside? Whatever. I waved the girlfriend over & we sat.The bartender handed us menus & we both ordered a Bloody Mary to get things started. So, I guess the bartender here has a reputation for being anything from prickly to downright rude. Though I couldn't possibly describe her as a ray of sunshine, she was civil. She also pours a Bloody Mary with a very heavy hand. What we got was basically a bucket of vodka with a splash of all that other stuff. I likey the strong Bloody Mary.To try out a wider variety of the food at Coop's Place, the girlfriend & I both ordered Coop's Taste Plate. This is a 5 piece sampler dish, which we ended up waiting a long time for, with the breakdown as follows:+Seafood Gumbo - lots of okra, not so much seafood, decent if you really like okra+Cajun Fried Chicken - pretty good, but the girlfriend got a drumstick & all I got was 1 wing, really? how about at least a thigh?+Shrimp Creole - not much shrimp, not much flavor, not so good+Redbeans & Rice - a total disaster, redbeans were burnt, rice was undercooked & in a puddle of water+Rabbit & Sausage Jambalaya - very good, a highlight for sure, ample portion size & delicious flavorWhile we were eating, I noticed that some of the staff were also grabbing a quick bite. An insightful observation I made was that the staff only ate the Cajun Fried Chicken or Rabbit & Sausage Jambalaya. I'm certain it's not just coincidence that the staff only ate the 2 food items I thought were acceptable & didn't bother with the rest.After such a magnificent letdown with the food, I needed another drink. The bartender was, after all, better at making drinks than the cooks were at making food, so I ordered a sazerac. She served it up pretty quickly & it was good.

Let's talk about the Cajun fried chicken. It was SO juicy inside, juice dribbled from the meat and the seasoned crust with Coop's Bayou Blend was real tasty. I wish I had some of that chicken right now.The rice and beans topped with scallions was cooked for hours with pork and I found myself some pork bones. So fair warning, all rice and beans in NOLA has pork. This is not Latin rice in beans. It is flavorful, porky, has tassles of pork in the sauce.The fried mushrooms were juicy, but were also a bit greasy served with horseradish dipping sauce. You can skip this.

A Jagermeister shot machine and a serious bartendress summed up my suspicion that Coop's was a dive. I was instantly in love. We settled in with our bottles of Abita and took in the scene of a half dozen regulars. A guy came in with what appeared to be a face that had been on the losing end of a serious fight and chatted with the bartendress about how his face had become to look how it did. It turns out he's a nighttime cook at Coop's and was trying to retrace his alcohol induced black out evening to figure out who had pummeled his face. Yep, Coop's is the real deal. Our seafood gumbo came to us with big pieces of okra, green beans, shrimp and crawfish and the jambalaya was rabbit meat-based. Both were wonderfully seasoned and a perfect introduction to \"good\" Cajun food. It would be really easy to laze the afternoon away at Coop's being entertained by the bar regulars' stories whilst sipping on Abita and noshing on gumbo.

Went to cafe du monde, walked around the quarter, etc. And he said he wanted jambalaya, so I looked around on Yelp and we ended up at Coop's.We didn't have to wait at all. Perhaps it was because we got there past dinner time on a Sunday. We immediately got seated at a table and had a server's attention soon after that.We ordered a plate of fried oysters and the taste plate to share as neither of us was very hungry. The food came out quickly and it was tasty. The oysters were good and the taste plate included gumbo, shrimp creole, fried chicken, beans and rice, and jambalaya. I liked that we could try a little bit of everything. As hard as I try to deny it, I was still tourist status at this point, you know. I didn't care too much for the shrimp creole but I liked everything else. I love rabbit and was excited that the jambalaya has rabbit in it. When I left, I knew I was coming back.So I went back when my friend Liz visited me from New York in September. Actually went back twice. We tried to eat there one day and were told to wait outside. When we poked our heads in to evaluate the situation, a server yelled something at us, at which point I said we're leaving.

Yes, even after we were yelled at. I still thought the food was worth it. And this time, we had to wait quite a bit, because there was a long-ish line outside. When we got inside, we got seated at the bar, which was no problem. She ordered fried chicken, Brandon got the beans and rice, and I got the jambalaya supreme, (which was probably silly because the fried chicken comes with the jambalaya but I was so sold on their jambalaya from my previous visit). We also got a bowl of gumbo to share.Food came out and we enjoyed everything for the most part. The chicken was great, like the last time.

The menu says its a \"A traditional Creole rice dish, simmered with tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, local seasonings, boneless rabbit, and smoked pork sausage.\" \"local seasonings\" could have something to do with voodoo, but I'm willing to bet its a bit more accessible to foodies---I just can't figure it out though. There's a spice mixture in the rabbit and sausage jambalaya I can't quite recognize. It tastes warm like nutmeg or cinnamon--but I can't be certain. Trust me when I say that when you try it once on your next trip to New Orleans, you'll go back for seconds before you pack up to go home.

Both were utterly amazing and my mouth is watering just thinking about them. The plate came with a piece of fried chicken (a drumstick) that might have been the best piece of fried chicken I've ever tasted - which is saying a lot as we have some crazy good fried chicken places in Chicago. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside without any hint of greasiness. The sampler also came with a cup of gumbo which I really enjoyed.

Flavor was just meh, not what I expected considering the rave reviews. I've had better minute rice mixed with salsa. But--- Here's where the fun comes in. Got the Bayou sampler. Actually not bad, but not great. About halfway through I picked up a fried oyster and pulled up 2 shrimp with it. They were connected by a very long hair that was mixed in with and cooked in the batter/breading. When I was finally able to get the waiter to come over (Be prepared to flag them down or you'll wait till the end of time to get service) he looked at it, said \"What the F*@K is that? and then looked at me like I put it there. It was still connected to all \u00a03 pieces of food. He took it out of my hand, no apologies and went back to the kitchen. NO apology, but he did take it off the bill. So, If you want mediocre food, terrible service, enjoy being cussed at, etc, go here.", "Date": "2013-08-07", "Author_Location": "Springfield, MO"}, {"Author": "Rob O.", "ReviewID": "kH6JOS5VSyJcejmBCkTgRw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Duck quesadilla was amazing.

We went to Coops because I was supposed to write a review for a Chicago publication and I was informed that the fried chicken at Coops was not to be missed. To summarize, the food was bland and seasoned poorly, and the wait staff was horrendous.To go into detail: When we arrived we were seated by the bar at a rickety table that was barley clean enough to put your hands on. Our waiter came over to ask us about drinks and seemed halfway between bored and offended when I ordered an ice tea. When our drinks arrived the iced tea was warm and closer to water with something that tasted like a hint on Lipton. After noticing my displeasure the waiter didn't offer to bring me something else, but instead begrudgingly asked us what we would like to eat. I of course ordered the fried chicken and my fianc\u00e9 ordered their specialty shrimp and pork dish. The chicken lacked flavor all together, and was served with a side of over cooked jambalaya...that was being encroached upon by warm coleslaw. My fianc\u00e9s shrimp was over cooked and the pork tasted far too much like salted two day old sausage. We were both horrified that so many people had given Coops such good reviews that we somehow missed the incredibly over-served man standing next to us that tumbled head first into our table, knocking our food onto our laps and spilling his potent cocktail all over my pants and phone. More than a little irritated i stood up to get as much food and fluid off of me as possible and expected the staff to bring me napkins to clean up with. Instead they rushed to the table to clean the food up and only brought me several paper napkins as an afterthought. At this point I assumed they would apologize and bring us a new meal, but we actually had to call them back over to tell them that we didn't want to eat food that had, had someone's else's drink spilled on it. We declined their offer of having new dishes prepared and instead asked for the check. Any decent restaurant at this point should have apologized profusely and offered to take care of the check however, someone other than our waiter came over and handed me a \"half off\" check and explained that the man who fell on us was already drunk when he came in. First off, where did our waiter disappear to? Second, it's illegal to serve someone you believe to already be intoxicated, especially intoxicated to the point of becoming vertically challenged. And finally we had only taken a few bites of our \"food\" when the man fell onto us. As I mentioned above I was supposed to write a professional review, however I don't believe Coops to be worth the time it would take me to write and proof it, nor the time it would take my readers to get through the amount of horrifying details I would go into over the food and service. If the owner of the establishment reads this I hope he has a long talk with his staff about how a professional restaurant is supposed to operate.

At this point my review would normally equal out to about a three, but the attitude there was marvelous. Like, no, we are not going to clear off these tables and let people in, because the kitchen can't handle that right now. And if they don't like it they can leave.

After much hype from Yelp reviewers and friends, we headed with high hopes to Coop's Place for dinner tonight and were very disappointed. I've given very few 2 star reviews in the past, but this one is warranted.Thursday night around 6 o'clock there was about a three to four minute wait for a table of two. A table of two isn't actually a table of two, but two chairs available at a table of eight. Not a problem, just a fact. Service is to the point; no greeting, just \"Are you ready to order?\". We were ready and excited to try the cajun fried chicken and each ordered a 3-piece. While we were waiting for our food, we spotted... ROACHES!... crawling up and down the wall and squished dead on the floor. Part of me wanted to start this review with the word ROACHES but I felt like taking the high road. We probably should have just left at that point, but we decided to stick it out. Well, it wasn't worth sticking around for. While the fried chicken looked perfect, with thin crispy skin, it was almost completely flavorless and very dry. Also, my third piece of chicken was like the smallest chicken wing ever. It was so small that the server actually asked which one of us ordered the two-piece when he brought our food. The fried chicken is served with a side of rabbit and sausage jambalaya and coleslaw. The jambalaya was fine, kind of tasted like it had been sitting in the pot for a while, but go figure, the boy said that the coleslaw was the best he's ever had. The food was definitely forgettable, to the point that I was trying to forget I ever ate it.I won't even name drop places with better fried chicken in New Orleans, but I will say that I'd sooner rather never eat fried chicken again than to go back to Coop's Place.", "Date": "2012-02-02", "Author_Location": "New Orleans, LA"}, {"Author": "Matt L.", "ReviewID": "soOShq80gQhYaTNPxg6oig", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife and I loved Coops place and would definitely go back if we make to NOLA again.

The rabbit and sausage jambalaya on the side was very tasty and well cooked as well and was a good portion. My wife had the Coops omelet which contained shrimp, bacon, cheese and fried oysters. The oysters absolutely made the meal and while you should be ready for the calorie bomb, I was happy that she needed me to finish it! I ordered a sazerac, and my wife did as well not knowing what it was - so I got 2 after she tried it (she's not a fan of rye). Fortunately they were well made and my hangover was willing. We got plenty of food that we loved and a couple good drinks for a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend it and return if I get the chance.

I loved that it was off the tourist-y Bourbon Street path (which is surprisingly full of children and their middle-aged vacationing parents and damn overpriced) so I accepted his dinner invitation. We walked the short distance from our Marriott Hotel on Canal to this small \"local's secret\" hole-in-the-wall spot. There was already a crowd out front at 6p-ish on a Thursday, but they were groups of 4 or more so we walked in and asked if we could sit at the open table for two by the bar. We got a grunt for an answer from the bartender. We took that as a yes and sat down. I can't remember exactly what I asked after that - something pretty tame like what the beers on tap were, or if we ordered at the bar or if there would be a server - but I remember getting a stern, condescending \"you're not on Bourbon Street any more you tourist and you won't get catered to\" sort of response. It was really off-putting as I'm certainly not out of my element in a dive (bar or diner) and doubt I came across as pretentious. But it really soured my taste on the rest of the experience. In any case, we sat down and I got a bottle of their local brew, and enjoyed the low key vibe and was delighted by their very local menu : Rabbit and Sausage Jumbalaya, Cajun Fried Chicken, Shrimp Creole, Red Beans and Rice, Blackened Red Fish, etc. Their prices were a tad on the high side considering their ambiance and service, but this place clearly had a reputation, so I went with it. I asked the server how spicy the Red Beans and Rice was. His response: if you have to ask don't get it. Um... ok. Maybe that' their schtick, to be rude? So I got the Rabbit Jumbalaya and Cajun Fried Chicken. And my friend got the Red Beans and Rice. It came out in a reasonable amount of time and I was pretty unimpressed. It was only ok. The worst part: I tried my friend's RB&R and it wasn't hardly spicy at all. All my personal bitterness aside, I was ready to let this place win me back with their food. I was ready to take one bite and go \"they act as lame as they want, I love it!\" Um, didn't happen. Oh well. I'm not sorry we went, but I won't recommend it or go back. NOTE: Reading the other reviews the attitude I experienced is certainly the norm, I am definitely one of those people who got treated like a tourist and am just annoyed since (I don't think) I act like or look like a tourist (I loved Decatur far more than Bourbon, and felt much more in my element there; like I said I'm no stranger to dives and the very different rules and etiquette expected of patrons of them).

The jambalaya was well-seasoned and served in good sized portions. The fried chicken was WONDERFUL! Crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and just a bit of heat in the seasoning.

I was on a whirlwind trip to NOLA \u00a0and wanted to hit some places that were not geared towards the tourist or a brand name. \u00a0Having to be in meetings all day to 5pm or later and then only having a short time to site see and shop I had to have my meal plans down to a science. \u00a0So after many hours of research on the great world wide web (and yelp) I found a couple places to try. \u00a0Coop's caught my eye and actually screwed up my plans as I had to come back the second night for another bowl of Jambalaya and skip on a lesser destination.Okay, onto the review. \u00a0Don't go in if you expect a clean floor, table cloth, indoor bathroom or for that matter a comfortable quiet booth. \u00a0Go, if your looking for friendly people, loud laughing and good home cooked food. \u00a0When I ask a Concierge for a recommendation for this type of dinning I describe it as, \"A place with dirty floors, sticky tables and food to knock your socks off.\" \u00a0Well, without any recommendation I found this place on my own. \u00a0As for the staff here... \u00a0All I got to say is folks in this part of the world are a mirror... \u00a0If you smile and laugh while looking at a mirror your see a smile and laugh in return.. \u00a0If you put your ass to the mirror all your going to see is an ass. \u00a0Okay, nuff said on that. \u00a0Be prepared to watch the bar tenders knock back a shot or three... \u00a0Seems Yager is what powers a couple of them.So, I grabbed a seat at the bar and spoke with the bar tender. \u00a0There is no draft other than a couple beers who's name I can not utter without a chill running down my back. \u00a0I explained this was a first stop and I was looking for their signature dish. \u00a0The bartender recommended the Cajun Chicken and Jambalaya Combo and an Arbita Restoration Ale. \u00a0So, I went with it. \u00a0I made quick dash to the restroom and found that it is of questionable cleanliness as well... \u00a0But, the smoker just outside the door sure curbed the piquant aromas of the previous decades worth of wildness and missed opportunities \u00a0(to be polite). \u00a0By the time I made it back to my spot at the bar the meal was being served. \u00a0Fast food no doubt. \u00a0Now as I took a picture of the meal the bar tender who was being powered by jager commented rather loudly about food porn and a good laugh... \u00a0Yes, I can honestly say the photo will be good enough to enter that category..The order was two pieces of chicken a half breast and a wing. \u00a0I was disappointed to the wing as one of the pieces. \u00a0I started on the chicken. \u00a0The skin was crisp and crunchy. \u00a0The meat... tender... very tender... juicy... sweet and flavorful.. \u00a0I would say one of the best pieces of chicken I have had. \u00a0I would rank in the top three places and at the moment place Coop's on the top of the list as the others were long ago. \u00a0The second part of the meal.. \u00a0The Jambalaya Supreme.. \u00a0Now, this was outstanding. \u00a0flavorful, just enough spice to bring on a bit of sweat and full of everything; packed with shrimp, crawfish, sausage, rabbit, smoked pork (tasso)... \u00a0 This is what made me forget the chicken wing as one of the two pieces on the dinner plate. \u00a0There was enough to fill me without being too much. \u00a0I am a hearty eater, but this was a perfect plate of enough to be overly satisfying without feeling like a need for more, but wanting that second helping because of the flavor explosion. \u00a0I did return the very next night for a second plate of Jambalaya Supreme. \u00a0I will say do the combo Chicken and Jambalaya dinner as I think it a better deal overall. \u00a0Enjoy the atmosphere and watch your step.", "Date": "2013-02-08", "Author_Location": "Boulder Creek, CA"}, {"Author": "Erin A.", "ReviewID": "rxFg-ssg8mHgxzFv_8ZgwA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like this place needs another glowing review...but it was so good, I'm doing it anyway.

Jagermeister?Atmosphere: Coop's is a bar that serves restaurant-quality food. \u00a0It's pretty cramped in there for eating, but there is a lot more open space near the bar and billiards area. \u00a0It's loud, like any bar, and there are a few TV's throughout and probably a dartboard. \u00a0The kitchen is open really late (not sure if the quality holds up through the twilight hours), but that's a really nice plus. \u00a0Either way, this is not a place to wine and dine your girl friend. \u00a0The only thing I'd ever propose here is more Jambalaya Supreme ...Service: Service was really nothing special (that's an aberration in New Orleans). \u00a0Our waitress initially forgot the fried chicken on my girl friend's taste plate, which ended up being the only thing WORTH tasting on the plate.Value: Everything was really cheap, except for the duck quesadilla, which ended up being the same price as our entrees. \u00a0I'd go back just for the Jambalaya Supreme. \u00a0Hell, I'd even get it to go.", "Date": "2010-01-30", "Author_Location": "Jersey City, NJ"}, {"Author": "Rachel W.", "ReviewID": "BO-yPm8qacjD_itPTcL9zA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the taste plate, and it can be shared between two people.

I mean really really poor service. I would go as far to say one of the worst service experiences in my life and it was consistently given by three different people.First the service. When we walked in the first thing we were greated by was one of the servers (not our one at the table) looking up and down at someone in our party, squinting and saying to her, are you 21? Not exactly the most polite way, nor effective way to check people comming into the bar. She could have just of easily said, \"of course I'm 21\" and not been 21. Great people warmly and asked to see identification. As we waited for a decent amount of time for someone to come by and notice us we finally had this fat bafoon who was also the bartender with tats and a ball cap come to our table. He stood there scratched his back and was silent, no greeting nothing then he managed to say, \"is anyone going to say something?.\" After that point it became apparant if we ever wanted anything from our trashy waiter we would have to stop him while he was doing something else. I even asked the person who delivered our food if we could get another drink he said \"ask your waiter\" turned away and didnt even manage to let the waiter know. When I did flag him down you would expect the guy to apologize for poor service or come by the table to check up on us, nope he continued to ignore the tables. But this seemed to be the way he provided service call me if you need me style. Food. All of the food was mediocre except the Jumbalaya and Gumbo which was the best I've ever had in New orleans. I had the sampler platter as I wanted to try as many things as I could. Everything was bland except the Jumbalaya / Gumbo which was to die for. You could tell they took time in making the Gumbo as you would find bits of oyster shrimp and other items hidden inside. The mixed drink I had was above par which was some sort of spin on a mint julip, and the menu selection was pretty good as well. The food prices were incredibly cheap.My final thought, order a helping of Jumbalaya and Gumbo to go and don't waste your time in here. Going to a restaurant should be a fun and inviting experience. You would have less trouble eating this at home or on the street. \u00a0Go to the bar for drinks afterwards.

My group had dinner at this place twice during our trip to New Orleans, and it was quite tasty each time. The service was extremely slow on our first visit, but it seemed like they were understaffed and the one waitress running the show was just swamped. She apologized profusely for taking so long, and we weren't in a hurry anyway so it was okay. Three members of our party (including me) got the taste plate, while one got fried chicken and my boyfriend got the jambalaya supreme. Said boyfriend raved for quite awhile about the jambalaya, saying it made his recipe seem inadequate. (I still think his is better, but I might have a bias.) On the taste plate, the fried chicken was definitely the star for me. The breading was flavorful, the chicken was juicy, and it was just amazing. I've decided that I may just not be that big of a fan of shrimp creole in general, because while their version didn't do much for me, I've never been able to find one I liked. The red beans and rice were very nice, and the jambalaya was also tasty, but they were all outshined by the fried chicken. On our second visit, I got the cajun pasta, which was highly impressive. The spicy alfredo sauce was awesome, very unique, and they were generous with the fresh seafood. My brother-in-law got the fried seafood plate, and I was able to sample some crab and shrimp from that, which were totally killer. I need to show up with a bigger appetite next time so I can order that! We had the same waitress the second time around, and the service was much quicker because she wasn't so overwhelmed.Prices are very nice for what you get, and I loved the location, as it was a bit removed from the madness of Bourbon Street.

My first recommendation: Don't order this unless you love rice, a whole mounding plateful of it. Don't be indecisive like me and just choose a dish. Preferably the fried chicken and jambalaya.It started with a small cup of seafood gumbo, which essentially was a watery soup with rice. a variety of seafood and shellfish sort of scattered in, and spices. I have nothing to compare it to, but I was glad I didn't order it as my main. Then came the main plate. The shrimp creole came with two pieces of shrimp sort of hidden in a lot of rice and tomatoes. It was definitely forgettable. Next to it was the red beans and rice with sausage, which is exactly what it sounds like. It had more flavor than the shrimp creole, but still wasn't anything too exciting. Next to that was the rabbit and sausage jambalaya. This and the fried chicken (which, unfortunately was only a small piece) were my favorite.

Bearing in mind that the service at this hole in the wall place was not famous for its service or ambience, we decided to follow the true spirits of adventurists hoping to taste the best Jambalaya as some of the critics and fellow yelpers had claimed. Now it's nearly four hours after the lunch experience and I am waiting at the gate for my flight home. With an empty to-go cup of Jambalaya from the Gumbo shop, I feel obligated to write a review for my fellow foodie adventurists. Let me start with a warning: don't go!Here are the highlights of our visit:11:15 - we walked in, greeted by a friendly waitress, a little bit overwhelmed by the old house smell but nothing too out of extraordinary for a bar place11:20 - I saw two bartenders making some cocktails by picking some kind of pickle green beans out of a jar, both with their hands almost fully inside the jar. That grossed me out a bit, however we didn't order drinks, thus lesser of a concern.11:40 - food was served, not too fast or slow which is good. I had the famous rabbit jambalaya with salad and hubby had Shrimp creole. The portion of the jambalaya is small, a medium ice cream scoop at most. There was some burned pieces which I assumed are sausage crusts however the lighting was so bad that I couldn't tell what I was really eating. And apparently my taste buds had the same problem as well. Granted I am not creole so I may not know exactly how the authentic creole jambalaya shall taste like but I know about good food and this is not it. The tomato base is overwhelming, the shrimp tastes dry and the sausage though has a good kick, is nothing spectacular. The rabbit bit tastes ok but not much more flavorful than a good piece of chicken in other places jambalaya. 11:50 My husband didn't touch much of his shrimp creole - rice undercooked and shrimp unseasoned. We were pondering how to get out of this place without being cursed as warned by previous previews. Just then the infamous roach showed up on the table near the wall and that was it. 12:00 we stepped out of the restaurant with two take out boxes full of virtually uneaten food. We threw the boxes in a trash can a few blocks away. I feel that some we needed to scrub ourselves thoroughly with some alcohol after the experience.

I had never been to Coop's until tonight when some friends came in from Chicago and insisted we try this \"gem.\" Well, don't bother. Dive \"hole in the wall\" places can be fantastic, but sheer filth is never cool. Add in the rudest, most condescending wait staff I have run across in this town - or any town, for that matter, and you can guarantee a miserable experience. The topper - the food was HORRIBLE. You will see glowing reviews on this site for the fried chicken. Well, I ordered what the menu claimed was \"paneed chicken with fettucini.\" Paneed means \"pan fried.\" What I got was a deep fried ball of grease faintly resembling a chicken breast on some sticky, totally over-cooked pasta that was so salty it was inedible. After cutting and plowing through the rancid grease coating on the \"chicken\" to get to meat and avoid giving myself a heart attack, (and trust me, I love fried food as much as the next gal, so this was extreme) I was rewarded with inferior, stringy meat that Popeyes or Kentucky Fried would be embarrassed to serve. \u00a0 Finally - one special mention- at the top of the menu they have a section listed \"house specialty drinks.\" They advertise a mint juelp. So we ordered some. The waiter - he said his name was Carey or Kerry, snidely told us that it would be at least an hour before he could bring us those drinks, because he \"had to go pick, sort, and clean the mint, and you know that's a difficult process.\" What? Pick the mint? Where, next to the garbage bins visibly outside the back door? We thought at first he was making a joke but it quickly became clear that he was not only a total jerk but that this entire place is designed to make tourists feel small and stupid.

This place was so DISAPPOINTING and the food...DISGUSTING. I went here on June 12th, 2011 after getting rained out of the Zydeco Festival. I did some research before coming to N'awlins and Coops had decent reviews. Well let me tell you....EVERYTHING about the place was just TERRBILE!1. The Environment. The place is TINY...so don't let the line outside fool you. It can only seat 20 ppl so us tourist have to wait. LET ME TELL U...its not worth it. Its dark, dingy and really a biker bar that serves food. NOT a RESTURANT. As evidence o the huge pool table in the back taking up space where they could put seating....obviously the focus isn't food.2. The Service: Well that's just NON EXISTENET. Some dude feeling his hosting authority tells me and my friend to wait outside. 2 minutes later we are seated, tossed two menus and the guy disappears again. I never hear, welcome, thank you, or even how you doin' . Nothing!3. Most importantly, the Food: YUCKY-O BUCKY-O. I got the Taste plate and there was not one thing I could stomach without some re-working on my part, literally. The gumbo outright sucked. It had more okra and green onion in it than anything. The jambalaya contained watery rice, the red beans + rice needed a lot of seasoning, I only at the fried chicken after also taken a hit of salt to the head (yes...like a shot)....and the Shrimp Creole was just \u00a0'eh.The food was so bad I didn't even send it back and request something new. I literally ran out of this place as fast as I could. Between the food and the piss poor service I'm amazed so many ppl rate this place so well.***Small disclaimer: My cousin who is a native ate here a few hours earlier than I and claimed her food was \"well seasoned.\" However, as for me, NEVER AGAIN!
