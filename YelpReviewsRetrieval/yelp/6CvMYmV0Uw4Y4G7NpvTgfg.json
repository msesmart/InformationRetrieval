I stick with the dim sum and appetizers.Everything on the dim sum menu rocks my world... although I do have to admit that the edamame dumplings weren't that exciting to me the first time around. I agree with other yelpers that it did remind me of mashed potato dumplings HOWEVER don't give up on them yet. I had them a second time and all of a sudden it made sense! The inside was so luxuriously creamy that it went beyond mashed potato and into a creamy dream. I'm not sure if they weren't made right the first time or if I needed to learn the magical ways of the edamame dumpling but I assure you... they are worth a second chance! They change the menu around but last time I ate there they had the jade shrimp dumplings... perfection! They are steamed, light, and juicy.Tuna tartar egg rolls are so rich that I recommend sharing the app with others although I will say that the concept of a tuna tartar egg roll is genius. The crispy crunchy outside is in every bite as opposed to the traditional crunchy garnish of other tartars.The spicy rock shrimp: again very rich and thus good to share. I love the micro cilantro that they used to garnish... it adds a really fresh note to the mix.Pecking duck salad... oh how I love thee. I can't tell you how many times I've eaten this salad. The frisee is dressed perfectly with a light citrus vinegarette and topped with a creamy poached egg and perfectly cooked duck. So perfect. Words just can't.The fried rice options are all fine but nothing to write home about: The veggie fried rice has a fun peanut foam that kicks up the flavor level a bit.The noodles are a better bet in the flavor department: The wild mushroom chow fun is a solid noodle dish. The cocktails are WOW. They taste great and pack a punch. The Charm and Tranquility have been around the longest. I prefer the tranquility to the charm personally.Service: let's just say that I can see myself being friends with the servers here. They are personable, friendly, and professional.Decor: ok ok it is a bit much. BUT how many times to do you look around your drab apartment and think OMG I NEED to get out of this house it looks like a crazy person's house... The decor at Buddakan takes you away. Maybe to a different kind of crazy... like the mansion of an eccentric Chinese emperor who designed his home in the shape of an outrageously dark maze... none the less, it wows. And I bet it looks better than the apartment you got going on.Word to the wise: do not go here on a weekend night!!

That's kind of the impression I got from Buddakan, only in reverse: There's some smart cooking going on here, but it tends to get overpowered by management's desperate desire to be sexy or hip.From the cool, minimalist entry to the cavernous bar to the four distinct dining areas, nothing really hangs together. Over there is a dark little love nest. Around the corner is a library filled with golden tomes. And down the sweeping staircase is a two-story ballroom lined with carved wood paneling and shiny lacquer screens. I felt like I was trapped inside an Ian Schrager sex dream after the poor man gorged himself on egg rolls.In the midst of all this visual overload, it was hard to focus on the food -- and that's a shame, because the menu offered a terrific variety of classic Chinese dishes with a modern twist. We enjoyed the chili rock shrimp, black pepper beef, and king crab hot pot, but for us, the real standout was the General Tsos dumplings filled with a hot & sour broth that just exploded in your mouth and left a lingering finish, like a fine wine.With a half dozen types of dumplings on the menu, I'd be tempted to come back and make a meal of the dim sum, except that there were so many entrees I hated to pass up. (I've already settled on tea smoked sesame beef and kung pao monkfish for next time.) This isn't superb Chinese, but it's very, very good. Next time, I'm going to ask for seating in the bar area, where I don't have to put up with the visual assault. In that setting, when I can really concentrate on the food, I might even award a fourth star.", "Date": "2014-07-04", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "David W.", "ReviewID": "8W2d6cpyuO0Lub20hcw3eA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place is totally rock star.....

Also got some spring rolls, which were great too, but just pretty normal tasting.The fish here is fantastic! Got the Cantonese Steamed Sole and it was perfection. So so good.

It is one sexy joint! We came on a Saturday for an 8 pm reservation and were seated within 5 minutes. Our server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. I noticed some folks saying this is not authentic Chinese food, yada yada. Well I don't think this is meant to be the Chinatown experience here. The food is more like high-end Asian fusion. I thought it was fabulous. We had lobster and crab shiu mai to start. They didn't look like the shiu mai you get at dim sum - this was way prettier and less greasy. Delicious. For the entree, my husband had the beef short ribs on top of some chow fun noodles. The beef simply slipped off the bones - very tender and moist. I had the Singapore Chilli King Crab. Being a Singapore girl, I wouldn't say it was like the chilli crab in Singapore, but the overall flavor was similar and without having that \"I'm from Singapore so I should know\" bias, it was by itself delicious! I balked at the price initially but when the dish came I was pleasantly surprised by how much crab meat it had! It was not messy to eat either (like real Singapore chilli crab). Really idiot-proof. Dessert was gorgeous and luscious: \"Crying Chocolate,\" a molten chocolate cake with Vietnamese coffee ice cream. If I could say one less-than-positive thing, it's that it is very loud in there with dance/house music. That is just the nature of the place and that is why it is so damn sexy, with beautiful people galore. I'm probably just getting old is all. There is a really long table downstairs that looks amazing for groups, only no one would be able to hear each other much. Anyway, this place is great for date night or a night out on the prowl!

I would have gladly paid more. My only gripe is that our server dropped a drink and it spilled on the table. I think the restaurant should have offered us something as a courtesy.

I rarely give 5-stars, but this restaurant merits this prestigious rating. It was an incredible overall dining experience, and I will certainly be going back when I'm in the city. Allow me to expound on this:The space itself was jaw dropping. The entrance was so sublime and understated, but when you entered the interior, the sheer size and impeccable and expertly designed interior will impress even the pickiest of diners. The restaurant is so huge that they have dining options for every type, whether you want a small, intimate room setting, an upbeat, trendy room, or a large, vaulted ceiling space with large, communal tables. The choices are seemingly endless. The ambience was perfect. The lighting was well thought out, and was neither too dim, nor too bright, and the addition of candles everywhere greatly added to the \"sexy\" feel of the restaurant. The music was also well-selected, and the volume was perfect! The food was so impressive here, and prepared very well. The presentation was exquisite. We had a question about one of our meals being perhaps a bit too cold, and they sent out the manager to apologize, and promptly took it off the bill! Their customer service was impeccable, from the waiters to the management...this restaurant is well run, and they truly care about their patrons. Ok...price: this restaurant is not cheap. You will pay more for a cocktail than you would for a full meal at Applebee's, \u00a0but...it is totally worth the money. I guarantee you you will not have as enjoyable a night at a chain restaurant as you will here. I left there with a smile on my face, and wanting to get back there. \u00a0If you're in town with friends, or out on a great date, make this your restaurant; you won't regret it.

Maybe I'm missing something, its more trendy then great food. Fair warning, its DARK inside. Like bring a flash light dark. I think its so popular because sex in the city had a big episode here. The lamb chops were cooked wonderfully, but for the price, 4 tiny chops is not a meal. Its one of those, where you get a lot of real estate on your plate, and a couple bites of some great food. My wife ordered shrimp....literally 5 shrimp on a big plate.After 125 meal, we ended up eating at a great little grocery store/cafe on our way back uptown! 35 bucks and we were stuffed. So in short, if you want really good food, there's too much quality product out there to go here. If your in town for a weekend and want to make your wife happy that she gets to see the big table Carrie ate at.......well, its going to cost you.OH, and I know I will start a riot here, but the Edamame dumplings suck. The texture is kind of disconcerting, and they have NO flavor. You know why everyone likes Edamame? Because most places cover them in sea salt. Well this is just the liquified beans. Try the pot stickers or something else. Oh, and last last thing. ITS NOT ASIAN FOOD. Its just not. Its asian noodles next to other foods. Pasta, meats, etc. If anyone thinks this is 4 star, their likely of the \"foodie\" group, and have lost their way with what real food looks and tastes like.

It finally happened on the weekend of 4/19 as part of my week long birthday festivities! I was able to secure a reservation through OpenTable for 10 pm about two weeks in advance, but when am I ever NOT tardy for the party? I was running late so I called Buddakan and asked if there was a grace period. They told me not to worry that they would work with me! Whew!I arrived around 10:10 pm and was seated at about 10:35 pm-10:40 pm. By that time I was super hungry, annoyed, and impatient, but I guess that's what happens when you're late! However, I do believe even if I'd arrived at 10 pm, I wouldn't have been seated right away since there were so many people by the bar area waiting to be seated and a hostess kept informing everyone things were backed up.Moving on, this place is so romantic! It's the perfect place for a date in my opinion. Really dim lights, understated, the perfect ambience. I will say, I'm not a fan of sitting too close to others. We were given a booth next to a mother, father, and their daughter. We weren't super close but I would have liked a bit more privacy.Ordering took some time but the food came out fairly quickly and perfectly cooked. Our waitress was super attentive and pleasant. When my gal pal went to use the restroom her cloth napkin must have fallen from her side of the table and onto her seat. A random waiter came along, folded it, neatly placed it on the table and smiled at me. I thought to myself, 'where they do that at?' Well, AT Buddakan!The host who informed us our table was ready however was robotic and stone-faced. I noticed a lot of the other employees had that same look on their faces. It was a bit odd. Also, for how gorgeous this place is, I found the restroom to be quite bland. But let's get to the yummy stuff ---FOOD!!!The food was delicious. Delicious is actually an understatement! We started off with the Cantonese spring rolls, ordered the lemon chicken, char siu, a side of minced pork lo mein, and other yumminess I cannot recall at the moment. We can attest that to the food coma I was in. When I tell you I was growing DEPRESSED as I watched my char siu disappear off of my plate and into my stomach, I'm being completely honest! I wanted it to last forever. That is how good it was.I really loved Buddakan. I'll absolutely be back. I didn't find it expensive at all.

It just so happened, we went on the day we got engaged. I'd heard rumors from friends who live in New York that the trendier restaurants have a habit of making you wait long after your reservation time for no real reason, which I was slightly worried about given that we had plans to have drinks with friends later on. Luckily, we were seated exactly at our reservation time. After a few cocktails, of course. Ignore their slightly steep price tag. They're good.I'm sure you've gotten the impression that this place has an incredible atmosphere, and the truth is that it actually does. It's one of the nicest looking restaurants I've ever been to. It can get a little bit noisy because it has A LOT of seating room. No matter, though. I just wanted to try the food.We started with an order of dumplings. When they came, we were slightly confused because there didn't seem to be any soy sauce available. Being the timid folks we are, we didn't bother to ask for some. To our surprise, the soy sauce was actually within the dumpling itself. Although hot soy sauce spraying out of dumplings can sometimes be considered dangerous, we didn't mind because the things were absolutely delicious. We couldn't wait for the next round. We ordered black pepper beef and cracked chili chicken for mains, with pork lo mein and pork fried rice for sides. Everything was excellent. Neither main was particularly spicy, as we were expecting, but the flavors were wonderful and we managed to finish all of it...aside from the sides. Beware that if you do go for sides, there's a bit too much for two people to reasonably eat.We didn't get to sample dessert due to the slight rush we were in, but overall it was a wonderful experience. If I ever get a chance to return to New York (and I certainly hope I do), I'll definitely give this restaurant another try.

The hostess were polite even thought our table was ready only 20 mins later. We waited in the lounge area and didn't feel the delay since we had a lot of catching up to do. Our table was located in the upper area of the restaurant, which was nice, however for next time we will definitely ask for a table in the lower level of the restaurant. We really liked the design of the interior and the low lighting which was not too dark but also created a very chic and trendy ambiance. Our waiter was nice, but with a slice of attitude. He recommended us to order a bunch of dishes and just share everything- and so we did. Our order included mainly dumplings and one red tuna tartar spring roll starter, beef filet and the black cod. The spring rolls were just amazing, the tune inside was fresh and chill and went really well with the crisp of the roll (which wasn't oily at all). One of the biggest surprises was the edamame dumplings- when I read the description on the menu I must admit it sounded a bit lame and not exciting at all. Me and my boyfriend eat out a lot, really big fans culinary and travel especially when we travel around the world (which we did a lot) so it is really hard to amaze or surprise us. Luckily our friends ordered thsi dish, and OMG, the first bite was just unforgettably. I cut the superlatives to describe it- just order it when you there and you will know what I'm talking about. The carrot dumplings, jade shrimps dumplings and the chicken dumplings were great as well. The cod fish was also incredible and melted in our mouths, however the beef filet dish was just OK. We also shared one dessert- the chocolate fondant, that was good as well. The presentation and the aesthetics of the each dish was very simple yet sophisticated, a real eye candy.

Edamame presentation was pretty and it's worth a try; as for tasting, it's a very smooth paste texture with soft and sticky thin rice dough playing in your mouth. Pork buns were soft and moist, very good! They have a lot of good size side dish items (rice/pasta) where portion is fairly large to share, and lots of good app/dimsum menu to try as tapa style dishes.

Our waiter on the first night completely neglected a birthday and was honestly, fairly rude about it. We reminded the waiter about the birthday and he seemed annoyed about the entire thing. He did not wish happy birthday, did not bring out a dessert, nothing. After being thoroughly disappointed with our service, the manager told us that the next meal was on him.Our flight home was canceled due to weather and we ended up taking the manager up on his offer. We had an amazing waiter this time and the service was spot on!Appetizers: 5Most of the dishes were incredible. The hoisin glazed pork belly, steamed sea bass roll and the spicy yellowtail yu sheng were amazing. They were easily the best things we ate at Buddakan. I'd go back just for those three. The carrot dumplings and duck salad were also good, but not incredible.Main courses: 3This was disappointing. After the great start, we expected the rest of the meal to be stellar. The sizzling short rib was ok, the broken chili chicken tasted like panda express and the tofu was very bland.

From the ambiance to the service, and especially the food, we were blown away. As previous reviews state, you will most likely not be seated on time and my husband and I figured out why. Their bar = their waiting area. This is genius on their part because no one is going to sit there and not order a drink. I am definitely not complaining since it was nice to have a cocktail and be able to take in their unique d\u00e9cor. We were sat after about 15 mins of waiting (and we were a little early) and brought to a table upstairs. Previous reviews say that no matter what, you should sit in the large room but I disagree. Although it would be interesting to sit there, it was definitely more private in some of the smaller rooms and easier to hear the people you are with. The service was fabulous! Our server in particular dabbled with like 3 other languages besides English and we heard her speak them to different tables. Now I'm not sure if this is true of many of the servers in NYC but I was impressed and felt like the visitors from her tables who spoke Spanish/German/French were as well! She was attentive without being at our table every 5 seconds which was also nice. Now for the most important part, the food! Let me start by saying that I completely disagree with many of the other reviews who note that the portions are too small; we left STUFFED! I would recommend ordering one appetizer to share if you plan to order a full dinner. We ordered the kung pao dumplings which were amazing. You don't need a dipping sauce because the sauce is INSIDE the dumplings, delicious! We then each ordered an entr\u00e9e and a side. They bring everything out as it is made so I think it is best if you are with one other person to order two items that both of you would like. That way you aren't eating while the other person is just sitting there. That is what we did and it worked perfectly! We ordered the short ribs which were to die for, and the broken chili chicken. We also ordered the Chinese sausage fried rice and the wok tossed noodles as our sides; both were great! If we did it all over again, we would most likely order just one side as we couldn't even finish our rice (mainly because we wanted dessert)! We had the crying chocolate for dessert which was a perfect portion to have just a little something sweet to split. It is similar to molten chocolate cake but the outside is less of a cake and more like a chocolate cookie with a oozing chocolate sauce/fudge center.

Our server was very nice and attentive to our needs. I also appreciated the fact that she didn't press us to order too much, and that she gave us an honest assessment of how large the portions are for each dish.Venue - The decor and ambiance are great. It has a clubby feel to it, but I still like its super modern and chic decor. Edamame Dumplings - The most interesting dish I got to try today. It's very original, and has such a great, soft texture to it. I highly recommend it to anyone!Crying Chocolate - One of the best molten lava cakes I've ever had! It comes very close to the one I had at Nougatine. I also loved the coffee ice cream that was served on the side.MEDIOCRE:Crab and Lobster Shumai - Just okay in my opinion, but my bf loved it.Pork Buns - It wasn't bad, but I've had better at Ippudo.Lobster Fried Rice - It was decent, and I really liked that they weren't skimpy with the lobster part, but it wasn't anything mind-blowing. BAD:Price - I love the venue, love the service, the food was alright, but... it was WAY overpriced. We ended up paying about $90 total for what was essentially a meal at a glorified PF Chang's. It really doesn't match the quality of their food.Overall, I recommend that you come here at least once, especially if you're showing around your friends from out of the city.

This is okay... But some, probably the mangers, have this serious look that is some how a turn off.... I usually don't care but it came off as intrusive.

How did I wait so long to come here?Located in the meatpacking district, right next to the Chelsea Market.Came here with my boyfriend and absolutely loved it.

I was full after this but the food tasted so damn good...Entrees: I ordered the sweet crispy jumpo shrimp and my boyfriend ordered the black pepper beef. Again, both were cooked to perfection and as a result we ended up overeating. We also had minced pork lo mein as a side but we had to take it home because we still wanted to try dessert and there was no way we would be able to if we didn't stop and make room at that point. The minced pork lo mein tasted great after sitting in our fridge overnight, in case anyone was wondering.For dessert we had crying chocolate. A must for chocolate lovers.I forget our server's name but he was very attentive, frequently (but not to the point of being annoying) replenishing our water glasses and asking us if there was anything else he could get us.

But I hadn't been there in 5 years so I was worried that my memories might have inflated my perception of the food. Not so! Everything was as good or better than I remember it.So the deal here is that it's family style Asian fusion food. You order a bunch of plate for the table and chow down. I believe our table ordered 2 appetizers and 3 entrees plus desserts. We had a very encouraging waiter. The waitstaff really is very friendly, especially considering how \"upscale\" this place is. They apologized several times that it was taking awhile for our table (about 10 minutes, but we were having cocktails so it was no big deal). Our waiter said he has been with the restaurant since the day it opened, and he really knew his stuff. He suggested great wines for the ladies to drink, assisted with our menu choices, and even threw in a few sorbet dessert. He was a pro and super friendly. I wish I could remember his name.Food: Definitely order the edamame dumplings. It's like fluffy little clouds of pure deliciousness, and the broth will really put you over the edge. We also had a steak appetizer and holy balls was the sauce that came with it delish. In fact, we loved it so much we kept the little pitcher back to use on our other dishes. The pork was equally as delish, though I found the pork fried rice with a fried egg to be a wee bit salt from the soy sauce. Personal preference I supposed.We also ordered 2 desserts, a szechuan peanut butter tart thing which was basically a spicy butterfinger aka amazeballs. A chocolate mousse with pistachio gelato, which was tasty but I found the mousse to be a bit thick and overpowering IMHO. Again, personal preference. We were also comped a dish of the sorbets which were so full of flavor I wanted to cry. So delicious.All in all, a truly lovely meal and totally worth the birthday splurge.

Good but nothing really special- Fried calamari salad. again good, but nothing to write about- Chilled udon salad. This might be the least favorite of the night because it was too sour and icy cold. It was about 10 F outside; who need icy noodle?!For main, we had:-hot and sour scallops. Giant seared sea scallops with woodear mushrooms and celery. The scallops were cooked to perfect, juicy and soft. I still thought about it the second day!- Glazed black cod with chili eggplant, black bean chow fun. Again, beautiful execution and presentation. Light and flavorful.- Sizzling short rib. I usually don't eat red meat. But this little piece of heaven literally melt in your mouth. Scrumptious and juicy. I could taste a little bit five spice from it. Very well seasoned.- Lobster fried rice and chili chicken. I did not taste either. Simply, I was too full and busy talking with friends :/ \u00a0And I don't like rice ... But they looked really good. Dessert:By this point, all six of us well stuffed our face. But hey, it was my bday so no skipping the cake! And Buddakan made a special bday dessert for me - molten chocolate cake with espresso ice cream and cocoa powder plus a bday cookie with my name on it :) The Dark chocolate fondant was also amazing, especially love the crunchy rice crumbs and pistachios. The citrus sobert and the almond bread puddings were also great, per my friends, thought I did not touch the latter at all. I had to order a dupio and one Americano to wash down the dessert :( I felt I just added two pounds in one night....The wine list also well curated. We got a bottle lovely gruner from Austria for apps, and a well balanced merlot from Wala Walla, WA. Both were perfectly pairing with our dinner.All in all, amazing food and experiences. I would same probably one of the best in the past two years. And of course, I got to share with some of my best friends. Priceless.I shall definitely come back for drinks or special occasions. Or maybe just to please myself :) \u00a0Yes, lady, this place is gorgeous and has a club feel.

The food is always interesting and creative.I have eaten at Buddakan a number of times each has always been a wonderful experience with outstanding service, drinks and food.For those that have never eaten there the dishes re truly meant to be shared as most of the menu is appetizers and dim sum dishes (basically Asian tapas)They also have a number of entrees and side dishes as well which run the gamut from seafood such as chilli king crab and lobster with black bean to duck and sizzling short ribs over mushroom fun noodles.The concept is basically Asian fusion, primarily spanning from Cantonese and Japanese style cooking.I enjoy these styles tremendously and typically frequent authentic Cantonese style seafood and dim sum houses quite often.The ideal way of ordering food, especially if you are in a group is start off with a mix of appetizers and dim sum dishes.One of my favorites to get especially if I am there with just my partner is the Bo Bo platter - which comes with two pieces each of shrimp toast, tuna tartar spring rolls, boneless spare ribs, carrot dumplings and a shrimp spring roll.It's an excellent appetizer combination platter and the perfect representative of the various flavors the restaurant offers. It's also and excellent value at $29 considering most appetizers are approx $12 to $15.The shrimp toast is very unique as unlike your run of the mill shrimp toast that are shaped like triangles these are shaped like balls. They taste really good.The spare ribs are excellent, well flavored and very tender. The carrot dumplings are quite unique in terms of shape and color as they are orange, shaped like carrots even with a green stem. The best word to describe this is whimsical or maybe fun. The dumplings are filled with a mix of tasty veggies. Solid.The spring roll is quite delicious. It's wrapped in a thin n crispy traditional fried rice wrap and filled with shrimp and a mix of veggies. Very traditional style, really good.The highlight of the platter hands down are the tuna tartar spring rolls.These rolls are the epitome of what this restaurant is doing in terms of creativity and in fusion.They take pieces of high grade yellow fin tuna mixed in a light siracha style spicy mayo and wrapped in a cold yet crispy fried rice wrapper. They were soooo good that we ordered another additional order of the tuna tartar.We also ordered the rock shrimp tempura as a starter. It's an excellent representation of this tasty and fun to share appetizer which was made famous at Nobu and is now on just about every sushi joint menu.The thing is that most places that offer it almost always never use rock shrimp and either use baby (popcorn) shrimp or cut regular sized shrimp into smaller pieces.It simply isn't the same thing.If you have never had or seen a rock shrimp its actually closer to lobster then shrimp in terms of texture and their sweet flavor. They also have a rock hard shell.The shrimp are just fried to perfection with a light tempura batter and lightly tossed in a delicious spicy mayo.It's easily one of my favorite appetizers from just about any restaurant anywhere.The shrimp ate always cooked to perfection, light, sweet shrimp with the spicy yet not overpowering. It works very well.For our main course we decided to go with the sizzling short ribs over fun noodles.The short ribs were braised to perfection, tender, full complex flavors of depth sitting atop of mushroom fun noodles that are the perfect compliment to the beef.The beef was so tender I began to just pull it with my fork and mixed it up with my noodles.It worked perfectly and suggest it to anyone who loves short ribs, braised meats and fun noodles. Overall it was a phenomenal experience and each has always been better then the last....It should be noted that my very first experience was over three years ago almost to the day for my co workers wife's birthday which happens to be two days after mine.My last experience happened to be last Saturday, which happened to be the day after my bday to celebrate my bday.My first experience was much more in depth as we got to try just about every appetizer and piece of dim sum.Some of my favorites being the general tso chicken soup dumplings - truly a unique app. But may not be for everyone as the flavors can throw ppl off.I personally love the appetizer ESP since I love both general tso chicken n LOVE soup dumplings.Imagine if generals tso had seduced the lovely soup dumpling for an amazing night of relations n your offspring would be the general tso dumplings at buddakan.Overall the food and alcohol are both pricey but extremely outstanding.It is easily one of my favorite restaurants in NYC.Go with friends and splurge!!!", "Date": "2013-10-15", "Author_Location": "Garfield, NJ"}, {"Author": "Boogie N.", "ReviewID": "Wvk0kKI8yQuyyZSIwCeyZg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One word: Amazing.First and foremost, Buddakan -- despite being part of the NYC/cultural landmark and history (having been featured in Sex & The City) -- is really a remarkable restaurant. It's lit like a club and its musical soundtrack is a bit subdued for a club but it's a bit louder than a bar. The acoustics, the lighting and the patrons are, more or less, club folk, and the staff wears earpieces and wireless radios more like Secret Service bearing chic aprons than Costco employees.Having said all that, my expectations were essentially nil, because I didn't know much about this place other than that it has a great reputation. And once we sat down and began dinner, I realized why. And that's before we even acknowledged one of us was celebrating a birthday that evening.We started with short rib buns and chicken dumplings, and our mains -- which we sort of shared -- were lamb chops, kung pao monkfish, pepper beef and a filet dish. We also ordered the green stir fry -- garlic, chinese veg, amazing -- and the chinese sausage fried rice.I could regale you with all sorts of adjectives that would leave you with your mouth watering mirroring some sadistic Pavlovian experiment. But that wouldn't be fair -- unless you're two minutes away from a reservation at Buddakan, in which case it would be great for you (and not for me, having to relive this amazement).Overall, I can say without hesitation that none of what we ordered was mediocre, okay, or even remotely average. Everything was well-prepared, interesting, unique and creative. Lamb chops with a sweet-and-savory asian crust, perfectly medium rare; short ribs with puffed buns that disintegrate once they reach your mouth. A chinese-esque stiry fry that makes you forget about the proteins and has you contemplating -- if for a second or three -- placing an order for a replacement -- and that's with short ribs on the table.I 'spose the bottom line is short and sweet -- amazing. Great for celebrations -- a friend's birthday, release from prison, whatever -- but the real crime would be to skip this place because or in spite of its proper place in NYC cultural history.", "Date": "2013-10-29", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Robert S.", "ReviewID": "pV0LxKAtCxOfQvfweEj4Uw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Atmosphere was terrific, interesting decor, very attractive. \u00a0Selection of background music and sound level very fitting. \u00a0Everything we ate was excellent & beautifully presented. \u00a0Server was a bit robotic but he was helpful & did his job well. \u00a0Bartender & host were friendly & accommodating. \u00a0We were pleased with this restaurant & would recommend it. \u00a0We will return!", "Date": "2014-04-28", "Author_Location": "Washington, DC"}, {"Author": "Trishel W.", "ReviewID": "RxIT7LUwcuiitNJ4XJBP_A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very quick service and tasty food.

The bass wasn't worth the price either in my opinion. The shrimp and lobster chow fun is a better option for the similar price. Another favorite of mine at this place is the crab sticky rice. It's delicious and very filling. Overall, this restaurant is a great for both small and large parties. I went both times with my close girlfriend and it was a great dinner and the prices aren't too bad for everything they offer.

We had asked him to recommend somethings to us and we took his advice on all of them. \u00a0We started with the tuna tartar rolls which were incredible. \u00a0They were a bit pricey and I wish there were more but they were good. \u00a0At the same time they brought out the dumplings which were also really tasty, full of bold flavors. \u00a0 Our next 2 appetizers were the pork buns which were top 10 things I ever ate and the shortrib pancakes. \u00a0The buns were fatty, soft, juicy, sweet, salty, and went well with the sour slaw. \u00a0The short ribs on pancakes which were my least favorite, were ok, just not up to par with everything else. \u00a0We shared a main coarse. \u00a0Once again Bens recommendation, we had the lamb chops with the baby bok choy and a side of prawn lo main. \u00a0 Once again, Ben did well. \u00a0We were just perfectly full, not over stuffed. \u00a0 I insisted we get desert so we did.I told Ben to just bring whatever desert he wanted and he chose the whiskey banana bread with ice cream which was also incredible! \u00a0My friend and I were in awe about the entire meal. Everything from the food, service to decor was fenomenal. \u00a0It was also mind boggling to see such a ginormous place operate at such high standards. \u00a0To the managers at buddakan I must say.

We opted for Buddakan as we wanted to have a true cool night out - preferably coming back to the hotel very, very late (or early..) ;-)We had reserved online about two weeks prior to the date, which was easy and we had to compromise by a half hour for dinner time only - we had expected at least a day of flexibility required on our side, as we booked for the week before Xmas with everyone flying into the Big Apple for shopping.. So this was a nice surprise.On the night, we arrived late as we had trouble finding a cab - a snowstorm did not help.Upon entry we found a very long reception desk manned with girls in black dresses who welcomed us and asked for our reservation. This was done in a very professional manner. We were told that they were running late when I started to excuse our late arrival, so we started to relax. We were asked to sit down in the bar area, where we would be picked up once our table was ready.We walked up and sat down in the large hall that was the bar - quite dark, pure, not what you would call a cozy bar. We had no idea how someone was going to find us, we had not been given a buzzer or anything like that. A nice girl greeted us shortly afterwards and passed as the bar menu, which we started to look at, when a few moments later another, very nice girl asked us if we were the xx-party - which was correct - and our table was ready. She then walked us out of the bar into the restaurant area. I could make out a kind of gallery around some sort of atrium with stairs leading downstairs. She sat us down in one of the alleys of the gallery, close to the stairs that lead down, both of us facing whatever was downstairs. I immediately had to get up and look down: yes, the room where Carrie and Mr Big had had their rehearsal dinner was down there, including the huge chandeliers. Although it felt strange in the beginning to sit in the \"alleyway\" we did not mind as soon as our waiter -another lady- arrived and was also very pleasant and helpful. We chose Dim Sum as starters and lamb chops and short rib as mains.The Dim Sum arrived a few moments later - at least it felt that way - and was great. We had ordered two different ones, included 4 Dim Sum each, and they tasted really good.After a bit of a wait we had our mains served. Usually, one expects portions in restaurants like this to be smallish: well we were in for a surprise: four normal-sized lamb chops and a large portion of short rib. The lamp chops were just right - pink and tender, great seasoning, really lovely. The sides were mixed veg which were cooked and seared to perfection. The true star was the short rib: very tender, amazing taste - we could not finish it however, it was just too much. And both of us love to eat, believe me.. But, as we had a long night in front of us, we had to have some sugary ending - and yes, we ordered dessert: Crying Chocolate. I leave you to get this and experience it yourself - it was absolutely delicious.All in all, this is a great place to come to with friends for a larger table downstairs, with really friendly, professional and helpful staff, and great food. Price-wise it is a bit costly but not extortionate - especially for such a trendy place, and it is New York after all... Personally, I did not like the bar area as it was too dark and cold - interior-wise, and would have loved to be seated downstairs.

Because of the small table, there was no space for anything, and instead of helping to find space, the food runner just stood there with our meals while we fumbled around trying to make space. The server was not friendly or helpful.

Having to go down a bunch of steep stairs in heels was a bit of a challenge but getting to see the long table where Carrie and Big had their rehearsal dinner was well worth it.We ordered their sampling menu which is 65.00 pp and includes several appetizers, entrees, and desserts. We were 6 and the amount of food was plenty for us. The waiter mentioned that if we liked something specific from what we sampled that he would bring out more which was an added bonus. The sample menu is a great way to try several of their signature dishes. Well worth the price.Service was great although it seemed like we had several waiters at once which was a bit strange.This is a great asian fusion restaurant in the meat packing district.

If you are like me who'd rather enjoy mind boggling \u00a0food at a whole-in-the-wall, maybe don't come here with high expectations. It doesn't mean the food here isn't great. To be fair, some dishes we had were pretty delicious, but you can probably get the equivalents without all that fanciness at many other restaurants in the city. Given all the hype about this place, I just wasn't overly impressed (particularly the 2nd time). Appetizer:Short ribs- tender with decent BBQ flavor. 2/3 of the plate was rather filled with a tasteless mustard sauce, which I'm still not sure of the purpose. Edamame dumplings- The mushy texture took me by a surprise. The strong truffle flavor was interesting. I personally question if the concept really works.Pork belly- Very well marinated and the bun was soft and chewy just like how I like them! However, it was slightly too fat and that it just can't top Ippudo or Momofuko. Peking duck salad- Blah... I would not have known the shredded meat in the salad resembles any part of Peking duck without reading the menu!Entree:Black pepper steak- great chucks of steak served medium with just enough black pepper sauce. The crouton and crispy nesting were some creative additions.Lamb chop- Buddakan knows how to cook their meat! Couldn't ask for more.Chinese sausage fried rice- nothing spectacular compared to takeout fried rice, with the exception of a sunny-side-up egg maybe.Black cod- Quality fish with a very tender texture. Could definitely use more flavor. The veggies on the side taste great by themselves, but didn't quite supplement the main fish.Dessert:All were very delicious, especially even after we had just busted our pants trying to finish the excessive amount of food we ordered.

The interior is nearly as dark as the exterior - this is the darkest, sexiest restaurant I've ever visited. As so many others have mentioned, the main dining room is stunning in size and appearance; there is no way of guessing that such a large, grand, open space exists in what appears to be a small, conspicuously inconspicuous building. There were at least five other distinct dining spaces as well as the large lounge, although you might not even realize there's a bar there while your eyes are busy adjusting themselves. They may realize this, as we were seated in this area first - presumably to grab a cocktail. We were too hungry to wait much longer to order, so we opted to be seated at our table.Cocktails, of course, were the first things we ordered. The cocktail menu, which makes significant use of Asian ingredients, definitely skews toward the sweet side; so while each was enjoyable (we sampled four different recipes), I found myself wanting something more straightforward. Some of them could even be mistaken as Latin American in nature.Although many dishes caught our eye, we settled on the edamame dumplings and chili rock shrimp. These dishes were truly exceptional - I could have ordered three plates of the dumplings and been perfectly satisfied. Like biting into tiny clouds. The edamame itself had a perfect smooth texture while the shallot-sauternes broth enhanced them further. Rock shrimp are indeed distinctive from regular shrimp, with their creamy texture and flavor. The chili and toasted ginger were a very nice, if a bit sweet, preparation for them.These appetizers set the stage for spectacular main dishes, but things got a little confusing. My hot & sour scallops, served over a bed of tofu, sweet corn and black mushrooms, were delicious and perfectly cooked. However, there were just three medium sized scallops. I thought it was a joke at first - as an entr\u00e9e portion, it was quite small, borderline appetizer. Other Buddakan locations serve four or five scallops for the same dish (thanks, Google). For $26, at this place, I'd expect four... not five, and certainly not three.With that off my chest, the other dishes for this course - all entr\u00e9e-sized, thankfully - included the Kung Pao monkfish (which I deemed the winner of the entr\u00e9es), charred filet of beef and lobster fried rice. The beef dish was bewildering: a bowl of what was supposed to be \"crispy wontons\" was actually taro and lotus root chips. A small vessel of a tasty sauce sat next to them, while a smear of mustard arced along the perimeter of the plate. It wasn't clear what sauce went where or why the wontons were missing. The lobster fried rice, mentioned in the most reviews for this Buddakan listing, was just kind of there. It sounds delicious at first - and sure, the lobster wasn't overcooked and the rice wasn't overly greasy - but when you realize how plain it is, you'll wish you got something else. Kung Pao preparation was perfect for this succulent hunk of monkfish. Quite plainly, it was awesome.Desserts - hyperstylized compared to our other courses and on the precious side - fell a little flat as well. Crying chocolate (another oft-mentioned dish), had awesome Vietnamese coffee ice cream, but the liquid center of the actual cake wept an unappealing clear sugar liquid as if its innards had separated. The crumbs, caramel and gold-laden chocolate plank were ... inconsequential. The citrus semifreddo was quite flamboyant, certainly the attention-seeker of the dessert menu. Perched on a crumbly kaffir lime genoise sat a delicately flavored semifreddo sandwich, accompanied by a pile of absolutely wonderful candied grapefruit and small dollops of yummy lime curd. The anise-flavored gelatin cubes were really over the top. Before I forget, I have absolutely no complaints about our server. He was only there when we needed him and everything was well-timed. There was an awkward moment of confusion when a busboy removed only my setting from the table (...hey! I needed those), but it was rectified quickly. Next time, I'd skip the cocktail menu and opt for a heavier dessert like the bread pudding. Clearly I already have a plan & look forward to returning soon.", "Date": "2013-03-09", "Author_Location": "Stratford, CT"}, {"Author": "Matthew M.", "ReviewID": "9xKt11W5lYIXxt0KtywX5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been here twice and its one of my favorite restaurants in New York City. \u00a0Everything on the menu seems to be executed perfectly. \u00a0The service is also attentive and friendly without being bothersome.

The atmosphere was beautiful and even though we didn't eat in the grand ballroom we got a chance to see it and it is a SPECTACULAR view and set up. Our waiter was Neo from the Matrix (j/k) and he was both friendly and helpful. Seriously though, it did kinda look like all the servers were extras from the Matrix but I'm not complaining. Based on how the environment is they didn't look out of place. I must say that the best appetizer I've had in a restaurant was the crab cake from Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, but...I've officially added the Jade Shrimp dumplings to the list as a close second. Man oh man...words cannot describe how good that dish is. The trick is going to be not getting another order before your entree gets out. It is that damn good. Trust me. My girlfriend had the lobster egg rolls and they were delicious as well (don't worry, I didn't hog my shrimp. We both shared appetizers. lol)For our entrees she had the sweet and crispy jumbo shrimp and I had the roast duck noodles. Both dishes were EXCELLENT. My dish included duck dumplings in addition to the sliced duck over noodles so needless to say I was in duck bliss! I usually take pictures of the food before I eat it but neither myself or my girlfriend were having it. We demolished everything put in front of us and didn't even think about picture taking until after we had left the restaurant to walk off our full stomachs.

The service is attentive, the drinks are incredible and the food is surprisingly good for a place so 'scene-y'. Usually at a place with this much hype and an atmosphere so gorgeous (the main dining room was where Carrie's rehearsal dinner in Sex and the City was filmed), you expect to pay mainly for the atmosphere and perhaps a good cocktail. However Buddakan has perfected all three important categories: atmosphere, cocktails and food. The cocktails are as delicious as their alluring names appear to be. I chose the 'Dream', served with Bacardi Limon, Shochu (a Japanese alcohol), guava and mint. Upon first sip, I was envisioning the next time, and time after that I would be back to Buddakan to try all of their cocktails ('Tranquility'...'Reflection'...'Fever'). Yup. I'll be back for you.For appetizers, the Edamame Dumplings are essential. This appetizer alone is reason to come back to Buddakan. The dumplings are soft and delicate, and stuffed with an edamame filling enhanced with cream, dashi broth and truffle oil. It yields for a flavor and texture so luxurious, stuffed into dumpling dough so light and perfect. The dumplings are then cooked in a shallot and sauternes broth, with chicken stock, thyme and served with onion sprouts. Incredible! Bravo Chef Michael Schulson. I love you for this appetizer. The Sesame Shrimp Toast served with soy sauce and spicy mustard was also good; crispy and crunchy and coated with white and black sesame seeds and bursting with flavors of fresh shrimp. We also shared the Charred Asparagus with black bean foam, Lobster Fried Rice with saffron and thai basil, and the Roast Duck Noodles with duck wontons and sliced duck. The Charred Asparagus was simple yet amazing. I enjoyed the Lobster Fried Rice and the Roast Duck Noodles were delicious (from the duck meat to the wontons to the broth) but was a tad over-salted. We were so full \u00a0when it came time for dessert but the Crying Chocolate dessert was calling my name (and looked incredible on our neighbor's table)... Malted chocolate ganache, milk caramel, and Vietnamese coffee ice cream. Save room for dessert.Overall consensus: Buddakan rocks. It is a great place for a post-work drink and appetizers, place to take a friend from out-of-town, a birthday, or to impress your parents. I would recommend to stick mainly with the appetizers and lots o' cocktails.Other menu highlights I can't wait to try:Cantonese Spring Rolls with shrimp and chicken \u00a0 Lobster Egg Rolls with mint, cabbage, and a sweet chili sauce \u00a0Hoisin Glazed Pork Belly with spicy shallots, cabbage, steamed 'buns' \u00a0Tuna Tartare Spring Roll with crispy shallots and ponzu \u00a0Crispy Calamari Salad with green apples, cashews, and miso vinaigrette Chili Rock Shrimp with toasted gingerBoneless Spare Ribs with chinese mustardMao Poe Tofu with minced pork and red chiliWhole Crispy Fish with chive blossom, green curry, and turmeric", "Date": "2013-04-28", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Liza A.", "ReviewID": "eWcLjfAp_H91A1jPCq9myg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you get past the feeling that you're eating in a dungeon, you'll love the share-able eats at Buddakan.

I made a reservation for 2 for a Friday night at 7:15pm and a table was readily available one week in advance. Niiice. 2) Decor/Service: \u00a0Did you know the Sex and The City movie was filmed here?! Not that this was the major draw, but man oh man, the interior design of Buddakan makes you feel like you're stepping into royalty. Beautiful colors on the wall, large dining areas where you're not breathing on the diners next to you, I mean, just check out the photos for yourself. The restaurant's foyer makes you feel like you're checking into a hotel in Vegas or stepping into a nightclub. Techo/pop music permeates the room, and the uber-friendly staff don't make you feel uncomfortable one bit for wearing jeans and sneakers (hey, I was coming from my 9-5!) while everyone else is dressed like fashion show attendees. ***Cool perk: \u00a0They have a coat check! Coming from Cali, I hadn't experienced that before, so it was nice that I was able to check in my laptop bag since I was coming from work. 3) Food (duh): As many others have mentioned, EDAMAME DUMPLINGS ARE A MUST. The edamame is grinded up and stuff into rice paper dumplings wrap. Very simple dish, no special sauces needed to make this delicious. We also ordered the Scallion Pancakes w/Braised Beef Short Rib -- the combo of the salty beef + sweet green apple is such an unique taste. For veggies, Cauliflower Stir Fry was spicy and sweet, and paired well with the Charred Filet of Beef that we ordered as our main entree. As for dessert, do NOT leave Buddakan without trying the CRYING CHOCOLATE. Sweet coffee ice cream paired with bitter dark chocolate ganache and ground coffee.

Nothing the restaurant did, but more so my group just ordered the absolute worse things on the menu.Specifically, the first time I was here...I started off with the edamame dumplings and I was supremely underwhelmed and dissappointed. two people who I was with (who were trying to be health freaks) insisted that we get these when I didn't think it looked that good.....In any case, my fears were right...these dumplings were small, the edamame was pureed and tasted like baby food and overall lacking flavor. I understand edamame is usually just served plain or with light salt but this was just not worth paying 13 dollars for. This kind of set the tone and ruined the rest of the meal as my group wouldn't gun for any of the pricier dishes as well, opting to split the more generic food that you can go to a chinese takeout restaurant to eat.Like I said, nothing the restaurant did wrong, moreso the diners I was with.Fast forward - Came back again for an 11:30PM weekend reservation and could not have been a happier customer. Had to wait ~10 mins for our table but we entertained ourselves at the bar. Drinks are mildly on the strong side, though not too strong. My friends and I got the Reflection, Tranquility and Fate. All were very asian in flavor and super yum.Moving along to the food... We started off with the hoisin glazed pork belly. This was great! The rock shrimp was good. Pretty sure the sauce is not too healthy, but food that is good tasting rarely is. Either way, I recommend that you get. We also got the scallion pancakes with beef short rib and green apple. This was an interesting twist to your usual scallion pancake which is either plain or served with duck stuffed in between. The hoisin glazed pork belly is a GREAT deal here! you get like 5 buns for like 14 bucks. Well worth the value compared to places like Ippudo where its 9 for 2 (though I will always pay for that).For main course, we got the sizzling short rib and the lamb chops and I believe the boneless ribs.

Don't get me wrong, it's definitely Asian food beautifully presented in a nice place, in a very thematic, well decorated restaurant (cell phone reception was bad though...)Edamame dumplings - i really don't like the taste of it... very strange taste. Didn't even finish it. but I do understand a lot of people love it. Just doesn't work for us. Z and I have 99% match in food preference, and that's why we are perfect food partners.

If you don't want to wait 2 hours for it, order it at the bar. Tuna Tartare Spring Roll - interesting combination. but it's not that impressive. Scallion pancake - the braised beef tasted a bit heavy/salty or something. Was expecting the green apple on top of the beef to bring some refreshing feeling to this dish but didn't deliver. Peking Duck - even my trusted foodie friend really like it. I just don't get what's so special about it? I can get better quality and lower price from an authentic chinese restaurant... The Hoisin sauce is too salty and not authentic at all... But the wrap is actually what you are supposed to get for peking duck, which is a very thin slice instead of the bun for the pork belly.

The entrees however were lacking. We ordered the king crab hot pot and it was quite subpar. The famed lobster fried rice came out cold and perhaps, the lobster didn't find his way to the plate in this dark grandeous behemoth known as Buddakan. As for service, we had to flag down a waiter THREE times to order a drink. Perhaps, it was just too dark for him to find us.", "Date": "2013-05-06", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Veronica G.", "ReviewID": "YrYIWQpf09HhPeVcUB3URQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I travel a lot and get the pleasure of eating all over the states. I went to Philly years back and Buddakan was one of my favorite dining experiences. When it opened in NY, I was beyond happy. NY location was just as wonderful. I missed the big Buddha of the Philly restaurant though, but ambiance was great. Food was just as outstanding as I remembered. \u00a0My food suggestions: My only negative would be the deviled tuna tartar. \u00a0Its not bad but it has egg in it that totally takes over the entire tuna taste. If you like egg, go for it. Ok onto the yummy stuff. \u00a0Appetizers: Any of the dumplings and the seabass rolls. Entr\u00e9es: peking duck is incredible & priced accordingly. I also suggest the ginger lobster. It gives you an amazing size portion of the tail and claws so if you're a lobster lover...this is your way to go. Side: lobster fried rice for a side (duh...it had to be done). Veggie: you cant go wrong with a simple asian vegetable stir fry for ur veggie. Dessert: chocolate dessert, which I forget its name, but it had coffee icecream and a molten little cake that was one of the best desserts we both had ever eaten. Service was incredible and we had a great guy who was fun and used to work at the Philly restaurant as well so, he really knew his stuff. They also have wonderful speciality drinks like Longevity that are all named for peace, love and happiness feel.

I went last week after not having eaten here in about two years. I was excited to have the lobster fried rice, as it was one the best fried rice variations I have ever had. We ordered the following:Boneless Spare Ribs - I was a little suspect hen I saw that they were soaked in sauce and as soon as I took a bite I realized why - completely dry and overcooked.Calamari Salad - Cold and flavorless. It was literally lettuce and cold, pre-frozen, unseasoned calamari.Szechuan Long Beans - I know they say long, however, these were short and stubby...not to mention over cooked and soggy.Pork Dumplings - Run of the mill pork dumplings. For $18, I would expect more. I paid $6 once for the same amount dumplings from a cart in Burlington, VT (seriously, check out Hongs.) that were much more flavorful and filled with double the pork.Lobster Fried Rice - Ahhh, here it comes I thought, my eyes lit up with excitement, I dug my fork in and took a big bite. Utter failure. You know when you order Chinese when you're drunk and you leave the rice out for a while and it gets cold and hard? Exactly what this was. It tasted like it had been reheated and had no taste of lobster whatsoever.I definitely complained and the manager comped the bill (which she should have), but I left a tip for the waitress, who was good. I was definitely disappointed when I left. I know they are busy and they probably had a 60 person party that night, but that's not an excuse.

If you pick an appetizer and drinks, you can look at a bill closer to $150-$175. Due to the price the food is alright, otherwise the food is full of flavor and i'd recommend the sticky rice in the crab shell (excellent!)

I don't really go out alone all that often, but seeing as how the hotel room was turning into one big fat f*#k of a bore, I decided to get out and try somewhere cool as I waited for my friend to finish up her dinner plans.The place I chose was Buddakan and it is gorgeous. I mean really gorgeous. It's dark, it's intimate, it's romantic and it's the kind of joint that even if you are there with yourself, you are probably going to get lucky with yourself later. Know what I'm sayin? ;)So I ordered my usual Belvedere and soda and grabbed a table and perused the menu. I saw a lot of the spiffied up versions of Asian fusion cuisine; the dim sum, the spring rolls, etc. and then I spotted something I have feared for a very long time. Frog Legs.I am not much of a frog person and while I've kissed many and have yet to find my prince, the idea of eating part of one is something I have feared for decades and so I decided to give into the fear and move onto to trying something safe, but dammit if my eyes didn't keep going back to the frog legs. Now I don't know if it was the Food Network weird foods special I watched on the plane or the fact that I was all alone and figured, \"What the hell?\" but as soon as the waiter came over I said, \"Frog Legs please and the beef tartare\"What?I couldn't believe what came out of my mouth and with such confidence at that. Who the hell was I on a date with. Clearly the self I know and love never would have ordered that on our date, but the order was in, so I figured I outta start prepping myself for the pending dish.To do this i started texting people. I mean, what else are you gonna do, right? I think I sent this message out to about 12 friends as i sat there downing my drink. \"Oh my god, I just ordered frog legs and I am scuuuurrred\" Soon people started texting me back things like \"Ewwwhhhh\" \"Girl, you crazy\" \"Come home!!\" \"Tastes like...yardbird?\" and then I looked up to see the waiter holding my dish. Oh god.So there it sat, staring at me and honestly it wasn't as scuuuurry looking as I had imagined in my warped paranoid brain. The little pieces of leg were mixed in with cabbage and golden chives in a creamy garlicky sauce and compared to the plate of raw meat with tapioca balls next to it, I figured I should just jump in.And so I did. I picked one of the things up with my chopsticks and in my mouth it went. As I chewed I thought, \"Steph, you realize you are eating a frog right now. A ribbit. A little guy that used to make noises outside of your bedroom window as a kid. You were chomping down on one of those cute little tadpoles you used to love so much, but damn it, this is actually really tasty.\"I then found myself grabbing every little piece and enjoying them fully. \u00a0I then switched to the beef tartare and after a few nibbles of that I had had enough. It was way too spicy anyway. I then got the text from my friend I was waiting for and wrapped up the check and made my way out to join her.I ate a frog ladies and gentlemen.

It felt like my date and I walked an entire city block between the coat check and our table, but it gave me ample time to scour the plates on the other diners' tables to see what looked good. My date -- who does not eat like a bird, thankfully -- and I decided to start with the scallion pancakes, which are topped with the most succulent shredded beef short rib meat I've ever consumed. We also had the Szechuan pork dumplings, which are served in a spicy chili-soy broth. YUM!Next came the broken chili chicken, which also carried a bit of a kick -- just enough to add some flavor and some spice, but not to the point of pain. What made it really memorable was the crispiness of the fried part on the outside combined with the juiciness of the meat and the spicy sauce. We also had the lobster fried rice, which was tasty probably the weakest dish that we had.

I loved this dish! The calamari was cooked perfectly, it was soft and not chewy, yet cooked long enough that the batter was crispy. I think i had some of the best pieces of calamari ive had anywhere in this salad. The size of the salad was really large as well. I loved the addition of fruit and the dressing in the salad. Delightfully light and tasty. Good to be shared by two.Pretty good:Shacha chicken: The chicken was very moist and had a great sauce that came with it. I loved the really crispy skin on it. Definitely a good choice and one of the more reasonably priced entrees.Lobster fried rice: This was pretty good with nice chunks of lobster in it. Not the most amazing fried rice but a solid choice.MEH/Not so hotKung Pao Monk Fish: Now when eating this I was thinking... I should have know better. \u00a0It just wasnt that amazing. The batter was nice and crispy but overall it wasnt that tasty and was on the salty side. Maybe its that the flavor was not all that different from your dime a dozen takeout serving kung pao flavor?? \u00a0Had I not ordered the shacha chicken I'd probably have been pretty upset/underwhelmed with the dinner entrees.Cooked twice long bean: I should known better when ordering this as well.

What I got was beans that were pretty hard and as much as I hate wasting food, couldnt bring myself to finish eating them.Overall this is a good spot to come to but I'd say it would be wise to read reviews on what to get/not get.

I saw a few people do this while I was eating. {Service} On point. Our server greeted us with a bright smile. He asked us if this was our first time here and offered suggestions throughout the meal. Our water cups were always full. Once we were done with the appetizers, new silverware and plates were brought out for the main courses. He also asked us if we were doing ok twice during our meal. {Food} Edamame Dumplings: My Yelp family was completely right about this appetizer. It was delectable. The wonton wrap was thin and light. The edamame filling was silky and savory (almost as if it was pureed with cream and butter). The dumplings laid on top of a beautiful shallot- sauternes broth. Scallion Pancakes: These are not the same scallion pancakes as Vanessa's Dumpling House or Prosperity Dumpling (Though, I like their scallion pancakes just as much). There are pieces of shredded braised beef short rib on top of the thin pancakes. Each pancake is also topped off with green apple. If you taste the green apple on its own, it is obviously tart. However, when you take a bite of the pancake, short rib, and apple all together, the tartness from the apple disappears. It's a beautiful thing. General Tso's Dumplings: No, there is not a piece of fried general tso's chicken in this dumpling. Haha...I only say this because that is what WE thought we were getting. Silly us. The wonton wrap was steamed perfectly once again. The chicken inside (NOT battered and deep fried) was tender, sweet and savory.Glazed Alaskan Black Cod: The Cod was delicate, slightly sweet, and savory. It comes with a side of diced chili eggplant and a refreshing mix of diced cucumbers and radish. Mongolian Lamb Chops: Perfectly cooked pieces of succulent lamb hugged by a lovely ginger crust. A must try for all lamb lovers. Almond Bread Pudding: I think I'm getting drunk off this whiskey ice cream? I could eat a tub of that any day. A great dessert for all bread pudding lovers.

Aw, fun! What's nice is that there are big tables, there are small tables, some brightly and some dimly lit sections. So really there's a lot of variety in ambience within the restaurant. My big crib is that my table is never ready on time, and they always eagerly usher me to the lounge area to get drinks. And, I am usually approached by different members of the staff, each about 5 minutes apart.\"HI! What's the last name on your reservation?\"\"I.\"\"I., Sorry. we're not ready for you yet.. looking for the Bryants\".By the 4th time that happens, one is understandably ready to admit, \" Okay I'll be the Smiths! the Bryants! the Vongruamlarps! the Venakataramanis! Just feed me already.\"Once seated, it's mostly good stuff. Contrary to expectations, there are at least 10 dishes from the menu which can be made fully vegetarian, and the friendly waitstaff always thoughtfully points out things like animal stock, gelatin etc that are not obvious from the menu.I do think that the unassumingly named edamame dumplings are the star of the show - was that truffle I tasted? Oh it was so delicious. Last night, I ate 5 of them, some of which rightfully belonged to my dining companions. Gulp... I'm sorry. The rest of the veggie dishes are a mixed bag - the spicy tofu with cashews is quite yummy though.Unfortunately most of the cocktails are rather cloying, but the mezcal/pineapple/jalapeno concoction stands out in its smoky character as one of the notable ones. Of course what would I be without ending a meal (or a review) without dessert. The crying chocolate dessert in all its gooey molten (albeit tiny) glory is excellent, although I did find blobs of molten butter inside the dessert, which I am not sure is a good sign. The jasmine honey cheesecake is pillowy and flavourful, but the souffle cake is not quite souffle at all other than being tall, and the banana fritters are predictable. In a nutshell, a great venue choice to bring large (or extra large) groups, or an out-of-town friend to impress them. \"Look! isn't this the coolest, biggest restaurant you've ever seen?\"", "Date": "2010-12-08", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Kevin K.", "ReviewID": "_-lwJJnZ1Kpjz8nTWFGbHw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Simply overrated. \u00a0The ambiance is really nice and cool, but I have to say that most of the dishes are just mediocre overpriced Asian fare. \u00a0In addition when you are paying $25-30/dish the service could be a lot better.I recommend this place if 1) are from out of town or 2) taking someone from out of town out and want a trendy restaurant. \u00a0In general I find that most places in the MPD just don't live up to the hype and I have added this one to that list.", "Date": "2009-07-22", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Jewel Y.", "ReviewID": "sCgpZZ7ZwZD1IVI2h_tT4Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I absolutely love the slick and clubby chinoiserie decor!!!

It's true: \u00a0I'm extremely, extremely wary of Asian Fusion cuisine. More often than not, it screams gimmick and is more a sign of chef's whimsy than artistic rendition of a cultural dish. Buddakan is a love-hate, hit-or-miss, take-it-or-leave-it kind of place. The main dining hall with grand ceilings and dripping wax candles certainly has its wow factor, but I wouldn't want to share that long banquet table that could fit a small army of diners. I've never felt so modest to have a dress go all the way mid-thigh. The food. There are only two reasons why I go back to Buddakan repeatedly: 1) Edamame dumplings. They could be on my plate every day of the year and I would still crave more of them. The most boring sounding dish is brilliant upon first bite. Believe the hype. 2) Desserts. Peanut Butter Bombe is incredibly light and refined, and might be the most delicate version of these heavy flavors I've tasted to date. The signature Crying Chocolate is for true chocolate lovers, better shared between 2-4 friends if only to eat more of the other desserts.

Why was I there? Oh, come on. You know it wasn't my idea and you certainly know I wasn't footing the bill. The four of us sat down in the lush and cavernous interior to be greeted by a huge ass bird candle centerpiece. It was so big I couldn't see my friend, or the waitress who came over to chat with us. Pushy and rather annoying, she used a pedantic voice when explaining the \"family style\" approach at Buddakan and suggested at least four entrees and four appetizers to share. Normally I would have rolled my eyes at so much food, but because I wasn't paying, I enthusiastically concurred. I also insisted on ordering drinks. I went for the \"Fate\", which I felt like a moron ordering. However, the elderberry-pineapple-prosecco combo proved to be a delicious one. Throw elderberry in anything and I am a happy camper. My friend's play on a gin and tonic also won me over, but it was not so memorable that I can remember what it was called, or even what the \"play\" was. On with the apps! The duck and foie spring rolls were an interesting way to serve up such fatty and succulent delicacies; which is to say I can't believe anyone outside of wd~50 would fry foie. Passable at best. The pork belly, served dimdum style, was a bit stringy for my liking, and just not as rich as I prefer. You know, that fat should be so moist, but it was on the gummy side and tough to chew. The chili beef tartar was delish, but it's hard to ruin a tartar if you've got quality goods. And finally, we all loved the frog legs, wok sauteed and covered in a ginger sauce.By the time the appetizer plates were cleared away, we were all starting to feel it. Now it was time for four entrees? Oh god. First thing's first: Get rid of that fucking bird candle centerpiece -- which a waiter did, patronizingly asking me, \"Do you want to bird to fly away? Say the word, say the word, this bird will fly away.\" Yes. Get rid of that fucking bird, asshole. Okay. Entree times. We tried to mix and match, but definitely went meat heavy, starting off with the short rib we had heard good things about. Thumbs up, but nothing too special. Next out was another meaty delight, this time the veal cheeks, prepared over lo-mein noodles with pickled apples. This entire dish was fantastic, and for the record, I had never had veal before. Unfortunately, I'll now be ordering veal cheeks. Oh, don't hate on me, I'm sure I won't be able to afford it anytime soon. We followed the heavy meat dishes with rice with Chinese sausage, which was a pretty food fried rice, but at the end of the day, just fried rice. Hard to ruin. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of dinner was the Three Crab Delight which blew our minds. The most delicate and sweet pieces of crab were served over more crab on top of crab. I can't explain to you how wonderful it was: I tried to hawk most of it but was soon overthrown by the other half of the table. So by this point we were ready for a trip to the vomitorium, but no, we went for dessert, which were all actually phenomenal. The highlights were \u00a0my blueberry tart served with mouthwatering corn (yes, corn) ice cream. Also a big winner were hot, fresh donuts with ginger ice cream. Clearly I am a sucker for kooky ice creams. The chocolate thing was also good, but I am over chocolate, and the other dessert was some thick white something covered in meringue. Eh, I can take or leave meringue. All in all, the food was pretty good. You know, give me a yummy cocktail and throw down some gourmet offerings like foie and crab and pork belly and I'll be smiling no matter what. But! I have had much, much better without all the pretense, without the attitude, and without the lame bridge and tunnel crowd. Sorry, Buddakan.

I had an absolutely fabulous time here. \u00a0Maybe it was all the beautiful people that I saw, from the Matthew McConaughey look a like to the actual Terri Hatcher. \u00a0Maybe I had such a great time because I started my meal off with one of those fabulous cocktails the Charm or maybe it was because I wasn't paying for my meal..but anyhow I had an absolutely fabulous time. \"Spoiler Warning\" Before I get into the details of this perfect meal, I just want to say that I believe one of the reasons why I enjoyed the food so much was because I didn't have really high expectations (given the 3 1/2 stars on Yelp) and because the menu only hints to the ingredients used in the dishes...so everything was a delicious surprise. \u00a0So if you haven't been to Buddakan and you're reading this list to get ideas on what to order just look at the names of the starred dishes, don't read the descriptions. \u00a0It will ruin the surprise. Oh and one of the great things about this place is that its family style..the only way I believe a meal should be eaten. \u00a0So first off on the delicious journey of my dinner was:*1. Edamame Dumplings, These little pockets of goodness were the best surprise...They were absolutely delicious. \u00a0It was like nothing I ever imagined! \u00a0The edamame inside was creamy and sweet, all this blended together with the soft dumpling skins and the salty broth perfectly. *2. Crispy Calamari Salad, The fried calamari was perfect, not tough or soggy, it went perfectly with the spring greens and soy vinaigrette.3. Chili Rock Shrimp, the fried shrimp in this dish were cooked perfectly, but they use a spicy mayonnaise sauce and since I'm not the biggest mayonnaise fan, this was my least favorite dish, still really good just not my favorite. 4. Boneless Spare Ribs, They were absolutely delicious, moist and tender, spicy with the accompanying Chinese mustard. \u00a0They were so tender you could cut them with your fork.*5. House Special Fried Rice with Scallops was so good!! It almost reminded me of a risotto, creamy with lots of scallops and peas. \u00a0This is how you can tell this restaurant is a five star establishment, only a real foody can probably appreciate this but in the fried rice there were peas, not just your easy-ordinary-frozen-from-a-bag peas but fresh-someone-took-the-time-to-depod-real peas...I can't even imagine who's job it is to sit in the kitchen and take peas out of a pod for a fried rice dish...but I thank them because it made it that much more amazing. *6. Shrimp and Lobster Chow Fun, this was another great dish, with a whole lobster (deshelled), giant shrimp, big chow fun noodles, and baby bok choy. \u00a0It was so tasty.7. Whole Peking Duck, This dish was just ok...I really wanted to try it, to compare it to Peking Duck House's version, and can say don't order it here..Its like the most expensive thing on the menu and you can find something tastier here for the money.*8. Charred Filet of Beef, So tender, it was like butter in my mouth. \u00a0This piece of beef was cooked to perfection, and then they top it off with this sauce, omg, this sauce was like heaven. \u00a0I don't know what was in it but it was def butter. \u00a0I tried every dish with a little bit of that sauce..so goodSo last but not least our desserts..Some how we ended up getting two chocolate desserts which I normally don't do but both sounded fabulous so that's what we chose. \u00a0From the first few bites I think my body wanted to go into a chocolate/sugar diabetic coma, but I pushed through it, because they were so amazing.*9. \u00a0Chocolate Mille Feuille, was this chocolate piece of art filled with bruled bananas, spiced chocolate ice cream, and this decorative avocado anglaise sauce (don't be afraid of the avocado, its sweet and creamy and you don't have to eat it, if you don't want).10. The last thing was this peanut butter chocolate pudding with cinnamon whipped cream, I don't recall what it was called but it doesn't seem to be on the regular menu. \u00a0The gooey dark chocolate and peanuts were absolutely amazingly delicious!And so to all my fellow Yelpers, especially the one that ordered fried rice here without egg in it (I won't name names) and all the scenesters without a clue, Buddakan is not only a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people, but they serve up amazingly creative and flavorful dishes that ONLY DESERVE TO BE EATEN by people that truly appreciate food for the art that it can be.", "Date": "2007-03-12", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "JulieJuli A.", "ReviewID": "OLN2eqvuuRJ-izxSIWQ6fw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "JulieBuddakan for V day... \u00a0what can I say??? \u00a0yep I'm a wonderful date... \u00a0 Reserved this over 3 weeks ago and the best I could do was a 10pm reservation so this spot is popular.... \u00a0 I honestly try to avoid these themed asian fusion spots as I am of the Asian persuasion and feel that the food will disappoint... \u00a0I go to these spots with a cynical mind thinking that food should always trump over the bougey atmosphere that's built into high ceilings, grand chandeliers, super sized Buddha's, enormous ice sculptures, long ass tables and super model hostesses.....So going in I'm thinking, where the heck is the doorman that's usually there trying to make the spot look like a fancy lounge/nightclub... \u00a0As i approached the over crowded check in area exactly on time for my resv...

THE FOOD. \u00a0 Started with the edamame dumplings cause everyone raves about them on yelp. \u00a0There were 5 pieces and very unique in flavor. \u00a0Almost like edamame mash potato as a filling in a dumpling. \u00a0I say unique because I thought they were ok and don't regret ordering it but my date thought it was fantastic. \u00a0Also went with the tuna tartare on top of chopped deviled eggs. \u00a0I thought that was better and a great combination. \u00a0The tuna though were small cubed sushi pieces. \u00a0I might have preferred tuna tartare to be softly mixed with the usual mustard, oil, lemon juice and then put on top of the chopped deviled eggs. \u00a0But still an excellent choice. \u00a0I considered the tuna tartare spring rolls but just couldn't fathom what that would taste like???Entrees were the crusted ribeye and the hot and sour scallops. \u00a0The ribeye was good and done medium (which they cooked it more than they should have). \u00a0But it does pale in comparison to the sizzling t-bone that i can get in chinatown. \u00a0It was a nice sized meat and we didn't even finish it. \u00a0The scallops were also just ok. \u00a0You get 4 pieces and the sauce wasn't really sour or spicy??? \u00a0It said made with mushrooms and tofu but neither accompaniment really stood out either. \u00a0I think both dishes are victims of a restaurant that wants to look shi shi and present well, but when faced with an asian dude that eats too much will fail in the taste dept.... \u00a0We ordered a Chinese sausage fried rice cause I think it will be something incredibly tasty and unique. \u00a0It wasn't :( \u00a0Just typical fried rice... \u00a0shuda just saved the $10 bucks and had white rice....Finished the night with the dessert special which was a chocolate cake filled with ??(forgot), some mousse with fruits in a triangular chocolate sandwich like setup, and sorbet covered with vanilla ice cream. \u00a0This was fantastico !!!! \u00a0A nice finish to a nice meal for a nice evening.... \u00a0 Again, the service was impeccable, they changed dishes and utensils for as after each course and didn't give us cheap takeout chopsticks like Megu did.... \u00a0Expect to pop $150 - $200 for this meal....So to summarize:Staff: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5 STARSAmbiance: \u00a0 4 STARSApps: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04 STARSEntrees: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3 STARSDessert: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5 STARSOverall: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4 STARS", "Date": "2010-02-15", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Lucy X.", "ReviewID": "o2BfWZ3Q0Ll6s_fGb-ZySg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The thing I'd have to say that I loved most about Buddakan is the atmosphere.

Tasted pretty good with the nice blend of shrimp and chicken.Hoisin Glazed Pork Belly - The flavors were very good but the Pork Belly is very fatty. It may not appeal to some squeamish eaters who don't like food with mushy/squishy consistencyCrispy Calamari Salad - Top notch. The apples gave it a slight sweet and sour flavor with an added crisp and the cashews balanced out all the tangy/salty/sweet tastes.Chili Rock Shrimp - Pretty good. Like the way they cook their shrimp. Not too overcooked.Edamame Dumplings - This was just average for me. Just mashed Edamame in a dumpling. Still tasted good but I wouldn't order again.Tuna Tartar Spring Roll - Really good. An interesting play on a classic dish.MAIN DISHES:Sizzling Short Rib - This was tender and juicy and loved the Mushroom Chow Fun sideWhole Crispy Fish - The presentation on this was beautiful! The fish tasted amazing, not too dry and not too undercooked. Sweet and Sour Chicken - Did not taste like the typical Sweet and Sour Chicken dish, which is a good thing. It was a toned down version with much better flavors.Glazed Alaskan Black Cod - Good!! Once again, fish was perfectly cooked.SIDES:Chinese Sausage Fried Rice - Pretty good but the Chinese sausage taste didn't come out as strong for me. Lapchurn has a very distinct flavor and it was missing a bit there.Vegetable Rice - Pretty standard. The Coconut Foam was interesting to look at but didn't contribute to the flavor of the dish.DESSERT:Crying Chocolate - My favorite of the threeGinger Spice Doughnuts - Very good.

From what I had heard about Steven Starrs' first venture into NYC, I had to check it out. We weren't disappointed. Visually, the restaurant is stunning. We were seated at a table overlooking the BIG room. It reminds me of scenes from movies like \"The King and I\" with its ridiculously high ceiling, elaborately carved relief's and 3 massive chandeliers hanging over a 40 seat long table.My wife had one of the special cocktails, the \"Charm\" ($11.00), made with prosecco, \u00a0passion fruit liqueur, apples and berries. To perfumy for me, but my wife loved it. For appetizers, we shared the chili rock shrimp ($13.00) and lobster egg rolls ($14.00). The shrimp were tempura fried to perfection, and the sauce was sweet and tart. \u00a0The egg rolls were, I think, frozen and fried, but they were still delicious with a sauce that I can't recall now.The wine list is categorized by adjectives. Rich, Refreshing, Silky Smooth and Muscular are a few of the categories. We opted for Silky Smooth with the Rex Hill Pinot Noir ($65.00). It was, well, silky smooth with a nice black peppery finish.For main courses, we shared the Filet Steak ($29.00) with a wonton filled with crispy potatoes and \u00a0Dijon mustard sauce, and the Lobster and Shrimp Chow Fun ($35.00) The steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and they got medium-rare perfectly. The portion was kinda small, I think it was about 8 oz. The mustard sauce was almost custard-like, and was great for dipping the steak with. The wonton was just a shell filled with potato chips. The lobster and shrimp chow fun came in an x.o. brandy sauce and the classic chow fun noodles (wide, slippery rice noodles) This dish was great, served in a deep bowl, and the lobster was cooked right...it wasn't too chewy as often is the case.Dessert was presented very nicely, the pastry chef wrote \"Happy Birthday Susan\" on the Crying Chocolate Cake with Coffee Ice Cream ($10.00) and we also enjoyed the Kaffir Lime Tarte ($10.00). What can \u00a0say about chocolate and lime? Just that the desserts alone would be a reason for us to go back.We splurged a bit on two Inniskillin Icewines ($25.00 each), but it's a birthday, right? The server was awesome in that she brought out tastes of three different dessert wines for us to taste, and when we tasted the Inniskillin, the price didn't matter. Rich and intensely sweet from the concentrated sugar in the grapes, it was the perfect end to a great dining experience.The server (Yonella) was very friendly and informative, very important to me, being in the biz. The service was prompt when we first arrived when there were a lot of empty tables. It got a bit slower when the restaurant filled up. I took about twenty minutes to get the check, which sucked cause we have a new puppy that was missing us. I know the server just got maybe 4 new tables, but that's when a manager should check on all the tables to see if anyone needs anything. The total check was $261.00 before tip, so if you are going to splurge here, bring a fat wallet or purse. (Well, we did spent like $140.00 on booze) Overall, I have to say that it was a good value, based upon the total experience. We are thinking of having my next birthday party there, but this time with 20 people, at the BIG table in the BIG room...and I want to sit at the head of the table!", "Date": "2007-02-25", "Author_Location": "Stamford, CT"}, {"Author": "Chantelle K.", "ReviewID": "oSVv4xUbaopQ-uQT8-Qp_Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One lovely Yelper - Thanks Phillip L.! - just reminded me Buddakan is also a Top Chef joint (so I can add it to my list mwahahhaha).

It was gorgeous and the food was yummy too! My two friends and I shared: Edamame Dumplings - Okay, let's get the bad out first. I did not like this at all even though so many reviews recommended it. It tasted like baby food wrapped in sticky dumpling skin. Save yourself some green and skip this. Tuna Tartar Spring Roll - This isn't too far fetched from how tuna tartar is normally served with chips or some kind of crisp. This one is so much better though because the crunch comes from the roll that neatly ensures that every bite is filled with delicious fresh tuna!Chili Rock Shrimp - OMG. This is my favorite of the night. The rock shrimp is perfectly fried and then drenched in a yummy orange cream sauce. The chili seasoning gives it a nice kick. I could have eaten two plates of this stuff.Boneless Spare Ribs - Succulent ribs! I wished I had some white rice to go with it. Chinese Sausage Fried Rice - Eh. It would have been fine IF the rice was cooked properly. Unfortunately it was hard and chewy. Not good news for a daily rice eater.

Weird I know, but between the elegant details of the walls, the fresco-like painting on the walls and the colorful abstract window sculptures, it's what came to me.

From the room, the hype and knowing the cost of things - I was expecting to be amazed by the food. I wasn't. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't blown away. It reminded me very much of a Chain restaurant, much like a Ruby Foo's.We had the Edamame dumplings, which I see raves for on Yelp, but am wondering if these people enjoy baby food as well. The dumplings were filled with green pureed mush and the \"Sauternes broth\" did not taste of Sauternes at all and was, imho, a waste of a good dessert wine. The lobster egg rolls were decent- did not taste of mint though they were touted as such, and were no better than local delivery. The lobster meat was a little tough too; one bite and the filling was all hanging from my mouth while i still held the shell! The crispy calamari salad was delicious and would be something I would return for (and is the only food related reason for the 4th star) and the General Tso's Chicken dumplings were messy and kind of boring.I only had a few items from the sides we ordered as I was pretty full (and ok, getting a little tipsy - which sometimes kills the appetite) but the crab fried rice was gross - a little too fishy, and overloaded on coconut or something sweet-ish. The Sugar snap peas we tasty but not very impressive/innovative. I had the sweet and crispy jumbo shrimp for my entree, and while it had interesting flavor, it also tasted like it was doused in the mayo sauce they use to make spicy tuna rolls, minus the spice, so it tasted like shrimp covered in sweet mayo. Nice flavor, strange texture - and once I think of seafood with mayo I get a little nauseous. I did get to meet Chef Dale (of top chef fame) which was cool, and while the food was well prepared (go Dale) it was really the structure of the dishes/menu that left me thinking Buddakan ought to stick to the less picky/more easily impressed metro areas, i.e. philly.A co-worker was a big fan of the beef dishes, and as I avoid those, I will defer to her, seems beef is their wheel house... but I still claim that Buddakan is overrated...Maybe I really am just a jaded foodie.", "Date": "2008-06-04", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Kyle P.", "ReviewID": "TtXArzX8FBl5PGLvB9K5dA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place was awesome.

Located conveniently next to Chelsea Market, Buddakan is a visual experience that is hard to describe. At first, it seems like you enter a hotel lobby, but once you make it past the bar, that's when you realize how large and stunning the place really is. Gorgeous chandeliers adorn the dining room that blends a medieval setting with industrial and oriental undertones. The rest of the space is really nice and functional too. The food was above good, but not great. I've personally had better Asian Fusion at Vong. However, there were some standouts. The Mongolian lamb chops and charred filet of beef were tender & perfectly cooked. The noodles were a bit greasy for my taste, but not bad. The Taro Puffs lollipops were just okay. Drinks, however, were very tasty. A lot of people complain about the service of Buddakan, but our waiter was really quick and efficient. The place does get ridiculously busy on the weekends, so I suggest going on a weekday to avoid the tourists and excessive B&T crowd. Otherwise, it's the perfect place to take a date or hang out with friends before going out in the area. Buddakan reminds me a lot of Tao, both food and space wise. But, Buddakan gets the higher mark for the flash and overall experience. I just really hope it doesn't get too touristy, but it's inevitable as word of mouth continues to spread.

The tall and slim greeters directed me to the rather large lounge where people can wait for their party and order a few drinks.Slowly, our group started to trickle in with one person running late. When we made the issue known to the tall intimidating waiter/usher/bouncer-looking guy, he responded rudely and basically scolded us, the customers, for something that was clearly out of our control. After we were seated in the grand hall, the waitress introduced the two ways of ordering: 1)to order individual dishes and eat family style, or 2) to do a tasting menu which was a bit pricier. We went with the first option.The food: pretty good. We were a group of 10 authentic Chinese people, so you can trust that the food wasn't bad since we had nothing to complain about. But for the same price, you can find better tasting food elsewhere. But we really come to Buddakan for the atmosphere, don't we?The food:~~~Edamame Dumpings: very very creamy, get it if just for the texture. The whole stuffing is made of creamed edamame which looked sort of like wasabi and it has a very mild taste.Lobster Fried Rice: high recommended. Delicious, flavorful, and not at all greasy.Mapo Tofu- not as spicy as I normally like. It comes with a bowl of rice which otherwise costs 4 dollars.If it wasn't for the rude beginning, I would have given this place 4 stars.

At over 17,000 sq. ft. and with a capacity for over 400 guests, it was not a shy venture.Appropriately, it has been divided into a collection of connecting spaces. There is a bar area with communal tables where diners choose from either a smaller bar menu or the full restaurant menu - which isn't really much more extensive. Numerous other darkly lit rooms host tables, but the main dining area is a sight to behold. In the middle of the entire layout, a doorway opens up to a cavernous room, with tables one floor below and the roof a floor higher than the main level. It is an incredibly ambitious space - complete with giant 40ft table in the centre - but somehow has been worked to conjure up a French-Asian royalty look, with rich maroon and gold colors. Eating downstairs must make one feel like being invited to dine at a palace.The atmosphere inside hums with a casual yet trendy energy, and the crowd is full of good looking, successful types and 'foodies' trying out the latest venture. More importantly, the Asian-inspired menu pulls off some impressively flavorful dishes. We ate at a communal table in the bar area that comfortably sat twelve people, a more relaxed way to dine amongst such regal settings. Notable were the Tuna Tartare dumplings, Lobster Dumplings with truffle soy, and the Sea Bass rolls with ginger. According to our waitress, the pastry chef is \"an inspired man\" (though she couldn't name him!), but we did not leave space in the end to confirm this. I do sense I will be back though.Overall, Buddakan offers an opulent dining experience and pleasing menu that tries hard to impress as much as the restaurant's presence does.

Service prior to our table being seated was great, all the staff were friendly. \u00a0I ordered the tranquility cocktail and it was fantastic! I had 2 of these cocktails and one bartender made it better than the other. \u00a0As our appetiser we had 3 BO BO plates. \u00a0As we were a group of 8, choosing individual appetisers would have been a nightmare so I would recommend this to sample most of the appetisers. \u00a0Second time around, I will definitely choose individual appetisers - the boneless ribs were amazing. \u00a0Separate to the BOBO we also had edamame dumplings, this had mixed feelings on our table - you either loved them or didn't.

Among the other things we ordered that night, I enjoyed our Bo Bo Plate, an appetizer sampler plate with 2 each of tuna spring rolls, sesame shrimp toast, boneless spare ribs, carrot dumplings, and Cantonese spring rolls. \u00a0My favorite, surprisingly, was the carrot dumplings for its non-fried flavor and gummy-looking, chewy orange wrap. \u00a0I don't deny that it sounds gross but it was a fun texture to experience around a delectable pocket of saucy shiitake mushrooms. \u00a0Except for the spare ribs which I refrained from, the rest wasn't bad but the taste of fried oil sort of overwhelmed what ever taste they were supposed to offer.The other two dishes we tried were my spiced tofu & cashews and my friend's medium rare charred filet of beef. \u00a0The best thing in my dish was the pineapple while my friend's filet came out medium even after we sent it back. \u00a0I appreciated how the manager came around to greet us and offered to send the filet back but was turned off by how our server then not-so-secretly disdained this request to the same manager who had extended this service to us. \u00a0Mystifying.Lastly, I enjoy strong ambiance as much as the next person who enjoys getting stares from taxidermied animals (Freemans) or kitschy cow figurines (Maureen's Kitchen). \u00a0When the main dining area of a restaurant (read: not lounge or bar) is so dark to the point of making me sleepy, then maybe it's time to ease up on the mood non-lighting and splurge a little for the higher electricity bill.My experiences with Asian fusion have never been stellar due to personal taste preferences for the cheaper, spicy stuff of the actual motherlands. \u00a0For the other camp that can't get enough of that exotic Eastern mystique, Buddakan will probably fit your $$$ bill just right.", "Date": "2011-08-17", "Author_Location": "Financial District, Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Ana G.", "ReviewID": "848m4WvTTl9JEXi55WpsJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The decor of this place seems a bit dated.

Sure there are some western elements like the charred filet of beef but the other dishes that we ordered were distinctly Chinese.The interior as you walk in definitely gives off a feeling of elegance, yet the theme didn't really seem to fit the overall asian theme of the restaurant. We started with the mushroom and sugar snap siu mei which was very pleasant and was served dim sum style. For our main courses we ordered the mapuo tofu, chinese greens, fried whole fish, charred filet of beef and chinese sausage fried rice. Other than the charred filet of beef, I'd had all of these dishes before either in China or in Chinatown. Maybe its not fair for me to make the comparison, but if even the names are going to resemble the actual Chinese dishes then they should taste as good if not better with the price point.The mapuo tofu was too sour and not spicy enough; it lacked the distinct numb feeling that you should get from eating the dish. The chinese greens were a little undercooked to the taste and the fried rice was very average.So thats why I'm giving them an \"average\" rating, I was hoping to be wowed but that didn't happen.

The hostess came to the bar to carry our drinks to the table, something I have never seen before. After that it was gourmet food heaven. We had the Bo Bo Plate, lobster fried rice, mongolian lamb chops, and the glazed alaskan black cod. Everything was so decadent! The black cod tasted as good as steak and every bite was bliss.The wait staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. For the first time in a NYC restaurant, I didn't feel rushed to eat my food and leave.

Once we asked her to take a picture for us but she said she'd be back as her hands were full, but never did come back. We ended up having a bus-boy take it instead. She was however quite polite and apologized after when she remembered. Food:Typical of a higher end dining restaurant. The portions were small, expensive, but delicious and well prepared. Everything on the menu is meant to be shared family style. Think of it as a Tapas restaurant with an asian twist. Most of the dishes had some asian/chinese origin to them. A few of the dishes we had:Edamame Dumplings - served in a light broth - basically edamame bean paste wrapped inside a chinese dimsum shrimp dumpling skin (sans the shrimp) - you can really taste the edamame flavour, slightly on the salty sideLamb Chops - medium rare - spot on, very tender. Deep fried jumbo shrimp - quite good, reminds me of a japanese izakaya dish Ive had before Ambiance: Romantic. The dining room downstairs was very nice - think medevil time long table with chandeliers hanging down from a very high ceiling.

Sigh*It was our end of the year office party and we decided Buddakan would be an acceptable choice of venue. So...the decor - how pretty! The lounge area is so sleek. The paintings in the restaurant are just sexy. You know that if the restaurant can hang a wall painting behind the front desk - again its just sexy. It took my breathe away (all you yelpers might think I'm over-exaggerating - but I like the restaurant so let me say all the good things I want). The main dining hall is so sexy with its high ceilings. So nice. They have this section of the dining area where the walls are painted like book shelves. The bindings are all gold. People dub it as \"The Library.\" So nice. LOL @ the people that work there. I guess my coworkers don't often fancy these type of restaurants. They were commenting on how the hosts (or maitre d's?) looked like security bodyguards. Hilarious. Nice people but sort of pushy in my opinion. Almost snobbish I guess. Jalape\u00f1o liquor? What? Why?! Cool. My first cocktail was charm. Very pretty and not strong. It is made with passion fruit liqueur, apple, fresh berries and prosecco. It's a good starter cocktail. My next cocktail is fever; made with mezcal, lime, jalapeno and pomegranate. Ever had a spicy cocktail? This is it. It has quite a kick to it. Very enjoyable though. \u00a0We also had a bottle of sake (sorry don't remember which). Lastly, the food. We ordered a whole bunch and if I commented on each one - well no one would ever read this yelp because then it would just take up the entire page. Highlights - lobster egg rolls, general tso's dumplings, deviled tuna tartare, and shrimp and lobster chow fun. \u00a0The not so greats - edamame dumplings. The reason for this is just because the texture bothered me a bit. I know a lot of people like these so its just a preference thing. For sure for sure order the general tso's dumplings. We ordered only 2 in the beginning and then ordered another 2 because it was so great. I do have to say though they are pricey for the portion that the restaurant gives you. I do believe this is a spot you should hit up at least once. Would I go there again? If I can afford it then for sure.

Anyways, you walk in and it's black and the counter is like that of a hotel lobby. I check in with one of the hostesses and she asks us to wait in the bar/lounge area for someone to seat us.

The Black Pepper Beef was so savory and juicy! I loved it! It went well pair with with the Lobster Fried Rice. I think the fried rice has been sitting there in the kitchen for a little bit because it wasn't as hot as I thought it would be compared to the beef. And the rice was a little hard. As for the Roast Duck Noodles, it was in a hot soup and pot when it came out. There was actually roast duck meat and not just the skin and the noodles were awesome. The dish was nice and fresh.

I'm a big fan of tuna tartare and it's good there. Rice and Noodles are also very good there. I wish I remembered which ones I had. But I'm pretty sure they are all good. But my Favorite meat dish there is Charred Filet of Beef (wonton crisps, mustard sauce). It is unbelievable. You have to try it there. And the sauce is soo tasty.

It's so delicious. They give you the buns on the side so you can make your own and eat it however you like.2) LOBSTER FRIED RICE... a little overrated if you ask me. Seems like they just made simple fried rice and threw in lobster pieces. ooo watch out so hard. it's still good. 3) SHORTRIBS... okay hi and listen up... LITERALLY i repeat LITERALLY... the meat just falls off. cooked to perfection. comes with a side of flat noodles (like the ones they use in pad see yew)... complements the meat real well. 4) VEGETABLES. very simple but very flavorful. can't go wrong. 5) OKAY SO THIS IS WHERE I DEDUCT A STAR... DO NOT ...DO NOT...DO NOT ORDER THE MAPPOTOFU. Our server said that Buddakan's is better than one her chinese chef taught her but... UMMMMMMM NO.it tasted like soft tofu thrown into bean paste. Not spicy at alllll even though it had a little spicy note. i dont understand. we were winning til this dish came out. OY. Anyhoo. Check this place out. THE PLACE IS HUGE!!! & THE DECOR IS GORGEOUS.

Service was incredibly (perhaps too) prompt and friendly, and pleasantly not-snobby for a place that's so popular. I could easily tell one of Buddakan's reasons for being one of the five most profitable restaurants in the U.S.: high turnover.

It just needed a little more zing, then it'll be perfect.Entrees- chinese sausage fried rice. So flavorful. The sunny-side egg was the gem of the dish! - Mongolian lamb chops. The ginger crust made this unique. I like my meat medium-rare, and it came out just the way I wanted it.- Alaskan glazed cod. Melts like butter in your mouth.- whole crispy fish with apple walnut dressing. I have no idea what type of fish it was, but they got the crispy done right.Cocktails- the Lush.

The tuna was smooth and buttery, and the avocado had been picked at the peak of ripeness. And the gyoza--never had I imagined that putting peas inside of a potsticker would be delicious, but whoa! Next was entree--after those two hard-hitters I decided to go light with a tofu-veggie stir-fry. The tofu was lightly browned, smooth and yummy paired with the crisp flavorful vegetables. My boyfriend ordered the hot pot which was a savory blend of broth, seafood and vegetables.Then the big show--we innocently ordered the donuts, thinking we would get a small nibble to end the meal.

Didn't matter though, I ordered a couple of these with no regrets.Wild mushroom chow fun - my table loved this. I typically find most chow funs either greasy or unappetizing, but this version was a hit!Pork buns - Very good. Not as good as momofuku (as expected) but still worth ordering. I liked the spice in the vegetables more than the pork itself. Yum.Lobster fried rice - delicious. Can't comment on how much lobster was in the bowl since my brother stole most of the little pieces before I had a spoonful :(Edameme dumplings - tried it for the sake of trying it. If it's your first time, i would suggest you do the same since it's unique, \"fusion,\" and beautifully presented. However, wouldn't order this again.General tso dumplings - Soup dumplings with a twist. this isn't your typical joe shanghai xiao long bao, but it's still good.Boneless spare ribs - meh. It was forgettable.Rock shrimp - Greasy, saucy, but at least it's a decent portion of food. It tasted like sweet and sour shrimp rather than rock shrimp. Chilled udon noodles & vegetable fried rice - do NOT order this. This left a bad taste in everyone's mouth except my mother's, who \u00a0combined the sauce of the udon with the fried rice to create a magical combination. You definitely need to order the crying chocolate dessert. the star of the night was the jasmine ice cream. WIN. also ordered the bread pudding, which was good, but not extraordinary.decor = 5/5. we sat at a very comfortable corner table.service (waitress name was megan I believe) = 5/5. She had the best line of the night when describing the bread pudding. \"It's so good that it will answer questions you never knew you had.\" Um, too bad this wasn't true, but still - it convinced us to order it.overall, $40/pp including tip+tax (excluding drinks) so I thought the prices were VERY reasonable. Also, I would recommend ordering the prosecco at the bar since you inevitably will wait before sitting at your table.

SOOOOO GOOD probably could have drank about 4-5 of these if i really wanted to. Started off with the General Tsao Dumplings which explode in your mouth (insert joke here) once you bite into them and it's like heaven. I believe there was only 6 of them personally i think you should buy two because 6 is not enough. Tea smoked Sesame Beef which i wasn't really interested in but since my friend told me to try it i did and it was really really good. The Dragon & Phoenix Rolls (roast duck, king crab, herb salad, sweet chili dipping sauce) were only ok to me, pretty underwhelming and overrated but i guess i could see how some people may like it. The lobster fried rice which we were given a ton of was also a big hit.

My corner gets the edamame dumplings. Holy unbelievable. We were a mere cocktail into the dinner and couldn't shut up about these dumplings. Had this place been geared towards a dim sum dining encounter, it would get 5 stars for this dumpling. I announced to the table that despite the pretentiousness that oozed all over every surface of this restaurant, I might return just to taste them again. More cocktails and people watching, and we get our entrees. For me, the crispy soft shell crabs with charred pineapple, tomato and Chinese black vinegar. These were OK, although my other experience with soft shell crabs involved a much more digestible shell; this one scratched my esophagus on the way down. I still ate the whole dish, because the crispiness was tasty, and I knew it was going to be a long night.At the end of the night I left with this impression: good food, flashy place, festive, slightly below the hype.

I started out with nicely done Fever cocktail made of mezcal, lime jalepeno, pomegranate, had the nice sharp flavor of jalepeno and a nice suttle \u00a0tangy taste of pomegranate. The Edamame Dumplings were pretty nicely done. Completely dissatisfied with the main course, got the monkfish and the mushroom noodles both of them turned to be below mediocre. Infact for the noodles we are being served the instant noodles, is it wrong to expect some nicer taste and flavor in a \u00a0classy place. The fish seemed fresh but the sauce wasn't any good, the peanuts were cooked properly, simple disregard for the taste and flavor. Overall as my friend said, this place is good to enjoy the atmosphere, a few drinks in the lounge and some appetizers, spare your main course somewhere else. For $110 for two I am not gonna get satisfied with sheer ambiance and all the scene creation, I need my taste buds to be tickled.", "Date": "2011-06-05", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Elaine C.", "ReviewID": "fnJBbpNId2Iv0UiedqgK5A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If I wanted mediocre Chinese food, I could've went to Chinatown...To start, the ambiance of the place is very romantic and intimate.

Chili Rock Shrimp came in a close second. My first thought was popcorn shrimp but way better! Got the Spiced Tofu and Cashew, Dungeoness crab sticky rice and Edamame dumplings as well. Spiced Tofu = PASS. Sticky rice wasn't all that special, barely any crab to taste. As for the dumplings, SAVE YOURSELF. When we saw it, both my friend and I narrowed our eyes at it.

Even when everyone was present, we had to wait another 25 minutes. The reservation had requested seating in the downstairs dining room, instead we were placed in a back empty corner upstairs, by this time we were so famished we didn't even want to spend another minute dealing with the dim-witted self-entitled struggling MAW (model-actress-whatever) hostesses to try and get better seating.Luckily being sat in the quiet corner meant much more attentive service. We went with three apps and three larger dishes, which turned out to me more than enough food. The edamame dumplings (which i was very skeptical about) were worthy of all its hype, the chili rock shrimp was blah - doesn't come anywhere close to nobu's rock shrimp, and the spring rolls were indistinguishable from chinese take-out spring rolls.On to the larger dishes, the sizzling short rib with mushroom chow fun was amazing...I would've been happy just eating that dish for a meal. The duck noodles were good but none of us realized from the menu that It actually was a wonton noodle soup type of dish. Lastly the chinese sausage fried rice came in a huge portion, enough for 5-6 people, but I was unimpressed, it was basically plain rice with a lot of grease and soy sauce.We finished up with ice cream, which of course was homemade and delicious.

There were about five hosts checking people in, so you know the place was busy.

We waited about five minutes until a very nice woman came and escorted us down the grand staircase to our table in the main hall. Wow, that was impressive! We all ordered drinks and a few appetizer plates as well as dessert. Everything was great, but since I didn't have an entree plate I can't really judge the food.

The big hall had an echo with all the people but I could still hear the conversation. Our table was at the base of the staircase, pretty big and private which was nice considering how cramped NY can be. And the crying chocolate cake was amazing!

The ambience is what drives people to this place - the moment you step in, it's like entering an exclusive club: dim lights, eclectic decorations, and a very grand dining hall.We had a private table, which was upstairs - placing us above the endlessly long dining table.We ordered two appetizers: the frog legs and hoisin glazed pork belly. The pork belly was pretty awesome. The skin was fried to a nice crisp and the fat just melted into your mouth. The frog legs were good, but it's not really something I would order again.As for our mains, we had the king crab hot pot and the alaskan cod. The cod was really nicely done - you can really taste the high quality of the fish. I wasn't so fond of the eggplant though. I'm not a big eggplant person, and it just was too mushy for me. The king crab hot pot was really delicious.

My friend got the Charm but it was a little too fruity for me.For entrees we ordered the Szechuan Crusted NY Ribeye, the Sizzling Short Rib, and the Shrimp and Lobster Chow Fun (my order). \u00a0Out of all of our orders, my favorite was the Sizzling Short Rib. That was so juicy and it almost melted in my mouth the way Kobe beef does. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED my Shrimp and Lobster Chow Fun; the seafood was cooked very well, the noodles were tender and not soggy, and there were some super-juicy tomatoes thrown in, but that Short Rib hit the spot. I wanted to steal my friend's plate and eat it, even if it was in front of her! (just kidding, but I did fantasize about it)Dessert was my favorite part. I ordered the Chocolate Mille Feuille, and my two friends ordered the Crying Chocolate and the Coconut Creme Brulee. The Chocolate Mille Feuille is creative and executed well. I ordered this simply because it came with an avocado anglaise and I absolutely did NOT expect it to go well with bruleed bananas and chocolate ganache but it DID! It was absolutely delicious. The spiced chocolate ice cream was a little hard on the taste buds but for some reason I kept mixing it with the avocado and it tasted better! The Crying Chocolate is like any other flourless chocolate cake but it was executed beautifully on the plate and was still delicious. I loved the lemongrass ice cream that came with the Coconut Creme Brulee - also well executed because coconut is a flavor that can go so bad so quick. \u00a0I was impressed and loved that dish, too.Overall, Buddakan is a great place to have dinner in the West Village; I loved the atmosphere, the food, the service, and everything in between.

If you don't like extremely mushy dumplings, you won't like these. My friend had the General Tso's dumplings and loved them. I was actually really jealous but couldn't trade her because of her allergy to edamame/peas/etc. For our main entree we shared the Lobster fried rice (served family style) and the hanger steak (this has since been removed from their menu). The fried rice was amazing. It was greasy but had tons of lobster flavor. I think we both shed a few tears when we couldn't finish it all. The hanger steak was phenomenal so I'm a little puzzled as to why it is no longer on the menu. Delicate slices of steak, cooked medium rare, were just delicious.

I can honestly say I enjoy everything I get here. The only one that was anything special was the Asian green stir fry. The staff is always so attentive and when I tell them I am vegan they are very helpful with picking out dishes I can have. The only time I had a problem was when I asked for soy milk on the side for my tea and they said they only have almond milk so they brought it but it didn't smell like almond milk and after several times of asking I found out it was regular milk.

This dish also comes with very delicious udon noodles.Scallion Pancakes: My FAVORITE PART OF THE MEAL. Delicious and tender beef atop a flaky flapjack. Order it!King Crab Hot Pot: Really fresh crab, tender and delicious. You add a mix of herbs and rice, and let is steep for a few moments before eating.Creme brulee: Yummy, with a beautiful caramelized crust (as it should be!) I was not a huge fan of the ginger sauce, but luckily, it came on the side and I was able to avoid blending it with the ice cream.Chocolate mille feuille: I was expecting delicious chocolate here: not what I got. The chocolate sponge cake is totally flavorless and relies on a heavier chocolate mousse for taste. The avocado is just that: avocado mixed with a bit of butter and squeezed from a bottle into thin lines.

He called and they immediately removed the extra charge and claimed they'd look into it. I trust this was a rogue waitress and not a habitual thing, but alarming nonetheless.

It's creative and I like the use of truffle oil in it, but I thought it was a little dry. Next came the deconstructed pork belly buns. 5 pieces of pork to put into 5 piping hot buns.

I was a bit worried that eating crab in front of my date would not be pretty, but the chefs were ahead of me on this one. \u00a0The crab legs were cut into smaller pieces and split in half so the meat could be easily pulled out. Phew. It's not really a hot pot of broth and stuff floating around. It's thicker like a stew. Nevertheless, it was very flavorful and had a nice kick to it.For dessert, we had the coconut custard cake. Skip this one. It didn't have enough coconut flavors to warrant it's name. There was a small custard cake, a fritter thing, and creamsicle ice cream. I didn't like the combination. It was too tart for a coconut dessert.

From the hostesses to the waiter to the busboys I have never experienced such attentive, professional and genuinely amazing service. Our waiter attended to our party of 7 with professionalism and he was a warm and funny guy as well. In addition, one of us is severely allergic to nuts (but not peanuts) and he went above and beyond necessity by checking every single dish with the kitchen to make sure which ones she could eat or not. When another table's noodles topped with cashews was placed before her (which she could not eat) the waiter apologized and assured her it was meant for someone else. Hers arrived momentarily.

Even as a large party, we were able to secure a location that was relatively quiet without renting a private room - pretty sure you can't pull that off in the Philadelphia counterpart. The NYC menu also has a lot more choices than the one in Philly. Think we actually ordered all of the hot appetizers, and they were all strong to quite strong. The favorites of the table were the lollipops, edamame dumplings and the tuna tartar springroll. Consensus was that the appetizers were a better value than many of the entrees, so we would advise ordering more appetizers you would at a typical restaurant and maybe just splitting an entree or two.

I usually HATE waiting to get seated, but considering we got there early, the drinks were delicious, and the other patrons were all good looking, I didn't mind too much. Once I walked in, I was amazed at how large this restaurant was. It could pass as a club. We walked down the stairs to a very open area with a communal table. I guess that's cool if you're into that thing. We were seated in the back room, which I preferred much more.So onto the food. We got the most creative dishes on the menu since one of my friends told us that the more traditional dishes were not up to par with authentic restaurants (as per my original dislike for Asian fusion). Edamame dumplings - was not a fan. I like texture in my food, and this had NONE. I had my hopes up because people called it gyoza. FALSE. Gyoza has a crispy exterior. This did not. The dumpling was steamed and had a thick skin (also another reason why I did not like it). Tuna spring roll - The BEST dish by far. But be warned because they're tiny. It's basically a tube of crispy spring roll skin filled with spicy tuna tartare. I loved the crunch of the spring roll with the fresh tuna and a hint of spice.Chili rock shrimp - Good, but nothing special here. Just fried rock shrimp with a chili sauce. Lobster fried rice - Quite delicious! I even tasted a hint of kewpie mayonnaise, which I like to do at home. It sounds weird, but quite awesome when done right.Dungeness crab sticky rice - I liked this better than the lobster fried rice. It's like the traditional dim sum sticky rice that come in bamboo leaves, but with a spin. Lots of crab and the sticky rice is a bit harder. Great presentation too. The fried rice came in the shell of the crab. Short ribs - mediocre. The short ribs were very tender, but they were over-sauced/too salty. Small cubes of fresh pear provided a good balance to the heaviness of the dish and also gave it texture.Crying chocolate - nothing to write home about. I have a hard time remembering exactly what it even was...Chocolate peanut butter bombe - also had a lot more excitement for this dish than it ended up being. The ice cream was just meh.

Though the serving sizes and presentations seemed generally like a standard one-person entrees.We started with a few appetizers, including the General Tso's Dumpling, which was stuffed with chicken, ginger and garlic, which were served right from the steamer basket. I found the Crispy Calamari Salad with green apples, cashews, and a miso vinaigrette also to be very good. I was tempted to order the frog legs, but we shied away. The steamed sea bass roll with cabbage, ginger, sizzling scallion oil was good, tender and buttery, but a little forgettable.We tried three main courses, and my favorite was the rich and flavorful Sizzling Short Rib with mushroom chow fun (noodles), and Asian pear. The meat was tender and a little fatty, the pear was refreshing, and the mushrooms and noodles were a great compliment. Next on my list was the Glazed Alaskan black cod with chili eggplant, black bean relish. The fish was light and flaky and the black bean relish was a nice flavor to go with it. The last dish served was a seared pork tenderloin with wild mushrooms, lotus scented rice, Chinese bacon. This was good, but I think we were all starting to get full and so it wasn't a favorite. I also felt like the rice, was a bit strong, but the tea-like flavor was good. We also ordered a side of charred asparagus that was amazing (for asparagus), it was not stringy, and had a great flavor with a \"black bean foam.\"Capping off the meal was a great cup of cappuccino and a Tempura Apple Fritter (essentially fried apple rings) with Saigon cinnamon anglaise (a white, creamy sauce) and salt and pepper caramel (a sauce that I found to be a little too peppery, or perhaps too dark of a caramel).

So why even advertise the meal as family-style? Anyway, they recommend 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 side. Yes, this was enough food but the portions you get are super small.Edamame Dumplings are supposedly what the restaurant is famous for. They are terrible and taste like paste. I mean, I guess I get the flavors but there is no texture to the dish at all, which makes it just very boring after the first bite. Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls were totally delicious. It comes with 3 small fried rolls of tuna tartare which may sound eh~ but they were so yummy I wished I had ordered 2 of those instead of the dumplings.Charred Filet of Beef was okay. The mustard sauce was good but there was just nothing great about the dish. Grilled Alaskan Black Cod was also okay. It was a bit salty for my taste and the black bean relish was mediocre. We also ordered a side of the cauliflower which was stir-fried with pork. It was a bit spicy and salty, and also just okay. The only thing I'd order again is the Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls. Oh P.S., the cocktails on the menu are super tiny. Like, mimosa-sized tiny. I ordered a Cosmopolitan for my 2nd drink and that was $15. Ridiculous.

I had been invited to a tasting dinner by a chef. Not only would I get to sample a trendy Meatpacking hot spot, but in the company of the people who are so talented at bringing food to that extra degree of taste we normal cooks aspire to go to. The short story: mixed bag, most dishes disappointing apart from a few highlights. The good: edamame dumplings are ridiculously yummy. After a night of drinking, I could mow through a plateful of those and forget any social obligation to share. Equally yummy were a pork belly bun, bok choy-wrapped sea bass, and crab fried rice. (My fellow diners also liked a tuna tartare spring roll and soup dumpling.)The marginal: a glazed beef ribeye, and a crispy chili chicken. While the beef was finely prepared, the sauce seemed to have too much hoisin. And the chicken was good, but seemed like an ordinary dish for Buddakan to serve. The no--thanks: a fried croquet that wasn't potato, but turnip. Another dish of pork belly was dry. Dessert was ginger flan (?), a combination I hope to never eat again. Sorbets were not that awesome; while not poor, I was surprised this was what Buddakan was serving. Though there were loads of criticisms made around me, I'm inclined to look at my experience kindly regardless. There are some good eats to be found here at Buddakan, simple things that remind me of trips to Hong Kong and creativity that works well when it does (I still want edamame dumplings).

HOWEVER, despite this, the food was excellent, the service spot on, and the atmosphere unbelievable. I'll break it down. 1. Service- Minus having to wait in the bar area for our table (what's the point of reservations, i ask?) the area was lively. Due to feeling ill I didn't drink but my friends cocktails seemed beautiful and creative. Our server was wonderful, attentive and explained the menu well. 2. Menu- Flipping unbelievably delicious. we ordered the springrolls which were steaming hot and amazing, and the rock shrimp. I am obsessed with rock shrimp and this was very good. For our mains we had the Short Rib, chillie chicken, lobster fried rice, blackened cod, caulliflower, and a few other things I can't remember now. All of it was steaming hot and delicious. Special shoutout to the short rib. I polished it off it was so good. My only negative is that the waitress suggested we order 2 aps, 3 mains, and two misc. from the rice and sides. This was way too much food for 3 girls and we ended up only eating half of it. 3. The Vibe- It was on SATC for crying out loud so of course it's cool but it was REALLY nicely done. New York has nailed the \"concept\" restaurant, and this one did not dissapoint. Large, loud, and lively and not so dark that you couldn't see your food or friends.

Anyway, it was our first time visiting New York and we only had a couple of days so it left us with a lot to see and do, but with very little time. So we decided to eat at least one nice restaurant while we were there. We went on the Sex and the City tour and our guides took us here. (Carrie and Mr. Big's rehearsal dinner party). They had some available tables for the same evening so we jumped at the chance to RSVP.Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait between 30-40 minutes. It was really busy that it was hard to even get seat in the bar area. Aside from that, the decor is amazing and the food was delish. I can't recall exactly what we ate because it was two years ago and we were so hungry that we dug in as soon as the plate hit the table. Don't worry, we did it in a classy way lol. Mind you, we were hungry from the waiting, but from a long day walking in the cold, rainy city. One of the two nights we had a nice place to go, it was the night we went here.Anyway, the prices were what we expected them, but it was well worth it as I recall.", "Date": "2011-06-30", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Parg B.", "ReviewID": "VE_77cxKIoi7MHcQxVPVAQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Absolutely hated the food here.

I LOVE BUDDAKAN! It makes me want to put on a sexy dress and really high heels, drink expensive cocktails and eat Asian fusion food while gossiping with my girlfriends or oogling my really hot date. The scene is definitely sexy. The big black door makes you feel like you're entering a club when you first go in. And get ready - you essentially are in a club anyways! When you go in, you're greeted by a blast of music, a dimly-lit chic space and tons of good-looking people who are dining and drinking.The hostesses will be on your right and will likely encourage you to hit up the big bar behind you. Definitely recommend ordering a cocktail (I had the Tranquility) - they are great! There's also a pretty serious wine list for those of you out there :)The food does not disappoint either. So often with 'sexy' restaurants, the food sucks. Not at Buddakan! I highly recommend the crab sticky rice (if you're asking yourself 'is this worth $20?' the answer is YES!). We also got the broken chili chicken (very flavorful and not toooo spicy), rock shrimp and scallion pancakes. All were excellent and my date and I quickly devoured them.The restaurant is HUGE. Very good for groups and yet surprisingly ALSO good for \u00a0dates. For tables of 2, I'd recommend sitting upstairs (fewer tables, better service). For large groups, sitting downstairs is the way to go - lots of room and bigger tables down there. Full disclosure: Buddakan has been around a little while.

Some of my favorites are the following: - edamame dumplings (has a hint of truffle oil)- pork buns (great asian flavor)- all of their fried rice/noodle dishes (can't pick one, they're all so good) - pepper beef (on the salty side but still a favorite)- miso black cod (comparable to the one at morimotos)- tuna tartar (make sure you don't forget to incorporate the spicy mayo)- lamb chops (not too lamby- great medium rare)", "Date": "2011-10-24", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Heidy M.", "ReviewID": "Bo2zVm3gtO_8nvOyHo2g7A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What a beautiful place! the decor is truly breathtaking!Pricey but delicious, the charred beef remains my favorite!

We had the chili rock shrimp. This was outstanding. So tasty I could not believe how good they were! We also had the lobster fried rice which was yummy, but over priced at $19 for rice and a few pieces of lobster.

We didn't have reservations and were able to get seats fairly quickly. But I think we just got really lucky that night. I would say that Buddakan is one of the unique restaurants in NY in that it has extremely high ceilings, which was a great change of scenery for seasoned New Yorkers. I also love any sort of Asian food cuisine, so Buddakan was the perfect place to go. We ordered the Spicy Yellowtail Yu Sheng, Chili Rock Shrimp, Minced Pork Lo Mein, Dungeness Crab Sticky Rice, and the Chocolate Cake with Jasmine Milk Tea ice cream for desert. For drinks we ordered a bottle of Prosecco and two glasses of their specialty cocktail, Charm. The food was wonderful. I was impressed. My favorite, was definitely the rock chili shrimp (I can see why that is the favorite of so many different Yelpers) and the crab sticky rice. The desert was also phenomenal. Everything else was pretty forgettable, including their specialty cocktail drinks. The service is what I had a bit of a gripe with. The food took a while to come out and there were many times where we had to flag down the waitress. This has happened to me both the times I have visited Buddakan. I took one star off for this. Ambiance is great. The decor is extremely beautiful. It seemed as if each of their dining rooms had a different theme going on, which I thought gave the restaurant an edge over others in regards to ambiance.", "Date": "2012-05-16", "Author_Location": "San Fernando, CA"}, {"Author": "Alex K.", "ReviewID": "EvGokYp1vJLuqSPRXy8K5A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I went to Buddakan for the first time with a date. Based on other reviews, I was expecting great Chinese Fusion, chic ambiance, and terrific service. While the food and ambiance were great, the service was surprisingly poor. -Food & Drink (4/5 Stars)Buddakan serves tapas-style Chinese Fusion cuisine. The menu is very modern and offers great options for both meat and fish lovers alike. Of the 6 dishes we ordered, I was particularly impressed with the Edamame Dumplings and the Wagyu Beef. \u00a0The Edamame Dumplings are worthy of the high praise they receive on almost every Yelp review - Edamame and Truffle are expertly combined for a truly unique appetizer. The Wagyu Beef is melt-in-your-mouth tender, and has incredible flavor. My date does not eat fish, so I would like to go back to try the other half of the menu. The cocktail list is short but interesting. I had the Solid, which is Buddakan's fruity take on an Old Fashioned. The Old Fashioned is my favorite cocktail, so I usually hold them to a high standard. The Solid was on the weaker side but flavorful. My gripe with the drink (And I know I am nitpicking here - don't hate me) is that it came in a coffee/tea mug. I am no expert on cocktails, but I will say that if I am ordering an expensive cocktail in a restaurant of Buddakan's caliber, I expect it to come in a clear cocktail glass (hopefully with a single ice-cube), NOT in pottery. If you serve a cocktail in a coffee/tea mug that you cannot see through, there is no visual aesthetic whatsoever. It is the equivalent of serving wine in a water cup. You can do it, but that doesn't make it a good idea. Ambiance (5/5)Dark, hip, house music, great spot for a date. Enough said. Service (2/5)Based on other reviews, I was expecting terrific service. However, I was unpleasantly surprised. First, our dinner reservation was for 10:15 PM. Upon our arrival, we were told to wait in the \"lounge area\" and were not seated until 10:32 PM. While this may be planned by the restaurant, I still found it annoying. I have worked as a waiter in 2 different restaurants. It is really not that difficult to have a table for 2 prepared on time for a 10:15 PM reservation. Second, there were 3 chopsticks on the floor near my table. I stepped on two of them while sitting down, and had to kick them under my date's bench. One of the bus girls commented on the chopsticks, but did not pick them up. That same bus girl had to voluntarily replaced my water glass because it was very dirty. Our waitress did not come by with menu's for 6 minutes. Definitely not off to a good start right?Third, our waitress was nearly non-existent. \u00a0We ended up ordering our cocktails from the bus girl. We had to send the bus girl to find our waitress just to order our appetizers. The service remained this way for the remainder of our dinner.", "Date": "2012-07-02", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Leah B.", "ReviewID": "qus8ep8-ZhgGifWYU14XTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wow, we're from San Francisco, and Buddakan was like SF's new Hakkasan on steroids.

Not great if you are a local, have standards for service, and recognize there are better places in New York.The food and ambiance were good, but I can't say the same about our server, Erik (I think that's his name). I came here for a birthday party on 12/5 with a party of 10. First, the staff was very accommodating even though a few people in our party were late (they won't seat you until your entire party is there). Second, the food was very good- I highly recommend the edamame dumplings, the chili rock shrimp, the mongolian lamb chops, and the tea smoked beef. The meat was really tender, and each dish was unique from the other, as opposed to some asian places where everything tastes like a variation of the same thing. The cocktails were forgettable, however.To start, we ordered 6 appetizers, 4 entrees, and two noodle/rice dishes and asked to keep a menu so we could order more. Erik had so MUCH attitude about this. He said, just so you know, that is only 4 entrees, and you have 10 people. Yes, thank you, I have a postgraduate degree and can do basic math. I really hate it when you order to share at a FAMILY STYLE restaurant and servers get annoyed that you are not ordering an appetizer/ entree per person. So, whatever, we continued to enjoy our meal. I had told Erik that it was my sister's birthday, thinking that, you know like any other place, they would bring out a dessert with a candle in it or something. At the end of the meal, he asked us if we wanted dessert, and no one was into it. And then...he brought us our check. He either completely forgot about the birthday, or was just pissed because we did not order the 1:1:1 ratio. At that point I just wanted to get out there. When our bill came, gratuity was added automatically. Apparently Buddhakan has not gotten the memo that it is now illegal to add gratuity to a bill automatically in New York. Disgusted, I paid (minus the \"additional gratuity\" they ask for on top of the automatically added 18%).

By the time I opened the drink menu, she had come to scoop us away to our table! That was a plus.I was a little disappointed when she kept walking us past the stairs [The downstairs is so beautiful, I was hoping to sit down there]. But we still sat in an OK area. [The ambiance wasn't as nice as downstairs though!]For drinks, I had a glass of Prosecco and my boyfriend had a Fever, which consisted of Tquila & jalapenos -- a bit of an acquired taste for some, but we loved it! [I say we because of course I drank some of his :) ]After reading so many reviews, of course I had to take others advice and try the edamame dumplings -- OUT OF THIS WORLD! THESE WERE BY FAR THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER EATEN!We also shared the hoisin glazed pork belly which was a gorgeous presentation with spicy shallots, cabbage, and steamed buns -- also, AMAZING!! The appetizers look small at first, but are filling for two to share!Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed with the entree as I was with the appetizers, but still tasted good -- I had Alaskan Black Cod; he had broken Chili Chicken [-- beer battered with yummy chili sauce].And lastly, for dessert, we shared a Chocolate Peanut Butter Bombe -- he loved the chocolate, I loved the peanut butter -- it worked out for both :)So I only gave it 4 stars for the fact that we didn't get to sit downstairs and because the entrees weren't as great as I expected.

With the trance exotic music blasting in the background, this is a great place for friends and after work hang out. Definitely not for family occasions. If you come here with the expectation of dining in an expensive authentic Chinese restaurant, this is not the right place to spend your big bucks at because what you are getting are fusion Chinese dishes.I left Buddakan with a curious and lingering afterthought, the food does not possess great Chinese flavor, some no flavor at all, but the execution of the food is good. Should I rate this based on Chinese foods that I've grown accustomed to or separate ratings with the Asian fusions, overall execution of food or flavor?We ordered based on our favorite Chinese dishes and the recommended meal per Yelp-ers reviews:(Appetizer) Chili Rock Shrimp 4/5Its a spicier version (probably Sriracha Sauce) of Honey Walnut Shrimp minus the sweetness. Its an inspired combo of crunch and creaminess which pops in the mouth like malt. Were it a tad sweeter it would have been perfect for my taste bud. (Appetizer) Steamed Sea Bass 4/5 Closer to its authentic Cantonese Steamed Fish. Probably my favorite meal of the night. Topped with generous helpings of sliced scallions and ginger. The ginger was amazing as it was deprived of its strong ginger flavor and was sweet. The fish was soft as butter and the flavor was top notch and well balanced. Short Ribs 2/5Soft and tender. Served on a bed of flat rice noodle (Shahe Fen or Kway Teow depending in which part of the world you're at). Flavorless. Ma Po Tofu 3/5Unlike your Szechuan-ese \u00a0Ma Po Tofu with different layer of spicy flavor coming at you at waves, this was sweet and acidic. Which was not bad. The tofu was cut perfectly into bite size pieces and have great texture. Leaves me wondering if this would make a great topping for a noodle dish. Stir Fry Green Veggies 3/5 Legumes in stir fry are good for texture. Crunchy and savory. I liked it.Lobster Fried Rice 3/5 I'm usually a sucker for good fried rice, but this is way overrated by Yelp-ers. I'm giving it a generous 3 cause I'm too kind for these sort of comfort food. Just standard fried rice with expensive ingredient. Would I come back for its expensive meals? Not by my choice; if I did, its not for the food but for the great hang out atmosphere.

I went with a group of (3 others.. 4 total). Here's what I think:I must say that out of the Buddakan's in the Tri-State area, this is my least favorite. Because we're talking about New York City, the portions are small and the food costs much more. Expect to pay around $40 to $50 per person for a complete meal. Some things we ended up getting:Appetizer:- Crispy Calamari Salad - Staple at ANY Buddakan Restaurant. The crispy squid is complemented with a vinaigrette dressing and some crunchy salad leaves. Topped with a few nuts, the dish is an absolute MUST-TRY.- Tuna Tartare Spring Roll - I love Tartares! You have to try this. You will get 3 tartares (However, because there were 4 in our party, the restaurant made 4 for us).Entree:- Sizzling Short Rib - Short rib was a little fatty. Cooked well, but a little tough in some spots. It lacked depth in flavor compared to other menu items. It tasted more like an attempt at Asian fusion. The meat, when cooked, had the consistency of something you'd find at \"Old Country Buffet\" instead of something from a classy restaurant. I'd probably not get it again.- Glazed Alaskan Black Cod - HOLY SMOKES.. This is one of the best Cod fish I have ever tasted! ABSOLUTELY BUTTERY, MELT IN YOUR MOUTH! I wish the dish didn't end!- Dungeness Crab Sticky Rice - Served to you in a hulled out crab shell, the rice tasted average. The service size is reasonable. If you ordered a few entrees, the rice is a nice side (if you don't want to order brown rice). Flavors were average. They throw in some nice crab meat for you to enjoy. However, nothing too special.Dessert:- Clementine Cloud - A silken vanilla could! It's very smooth. Almost reminds me of a meringue! The clementine and coconut which accompany it are a nice touch.- Sorbet - Asian pear, concord grape and coconut. The sorbets at all Buddakans are top notch. They are made in-house. However, for $10, you get a few small balls of sorbet. If you want to get full off sorbet, I suggest you go elsewhere.The service at the restaurant was exceptional. We originally had reserved for a party of 2, but they were very accommodating in getting our party a table for 4.I'd go again, but not if I was paying. Although some of the food tasted good, the price point made me feel it wasn't worth it. For the same price at either the Atlantic City or Philadelphia Buddakan, you get much more and a larger variety!If you're in the area, and you want to go to a hip and happening restaurant in Chelsea, this is a great place.

I believe in such a competitive city in regards to restaurants, it is one thing for the food to be amazing, however, without good service, the restaurant is a no go in my eyes. Our server, Gabriel, took 10 minutes to attend the table initially and desert was not even offered at the end. We simply felt like we were part of a production line, no desire to get to know the customer and we could not be off that table fast enough in his eyes.

There are couple square communal tables in the middle of the lounge and small booths throughout. \u00a0We opted for the communal seating even though a couple tables were open. \u00a0Our friends were meeting us later and it was a much better option. \u00a0Plus, it's such a fun & friendly vibe so it didn't hurt to share a table with other patrons.The Edamame Dumplings are still a staple. \u00a0We recommend this appetizer to every one we know and they always love it. \u00a0Our latest discovery was the Shrimp & Lobster Chow Fun - absolutely amazing!! \u00a0One dish I won't order again is the Tea Smoked Wagyu. \u00a0I much preferred the Sizzling Short Rib and Black Pepper Beef for a meat dish.2 favorite cocktails - Haze and Charm. \u00a0Haze is Buddakan's take on a Lychee martini, except it's made with Sake and Gin. \u00a0Very easy to drink and has a nice kick. \u00a0Charm is a sparkling cocktail mixed with passion fruit liquor and fresh berries.After dinner, and a few cocktails, my hubby wanted to order a bottle of sake while we waited for our friends. \u00a0He did not ask for a Sake/Wine menu and instead inquired if they carried Nigori Sake. \u00a0Our waitress said yes and brought out a bottle. \u00a0Much to our surprise it was not the same type of Nigori my husband had in mind. \u00a0Our waitress assured us that it was a great choice and it's their best bottle of Sake. \u00a0I saw the worried look on my husband's face transform. \u00a0He's no cheapskate, and we typically order a bottle of wine or champagne when dining out, but he always knew how much they were prior to ordering. \u00a0The 'best' bottle of champagne could easily top $1,000 in some restaurants. \u00a0Lucky for him, their best bottle of sake was under $100. \u00a0The sake was smooth and slightly sweet and he was happy with the selection. \u00a0Though I'm sure he was happier when he saw how cheap it was.

Downstairs is where it's at. I literally gasped the first time I dined here. You walk down banquet stairs (Think Beauty and the Beast: the formal dinner scene) and in the grand room is a long, long table (for your party of 20 or so, just eyeballing it). The space is gorgeous. High ceilings, sparkling chandeliers and the space is flooded with a warm, golden light. There is a \"library\" with glowing books, flanked by a bar of the premium kind.The drinks are fantastic (Try the \"Fate\"- Elderflowers, prosecco and pineapple). The food, although overpriced for Chinese fusion fare, is presented flawlessly and made with painstaking attention to detail and flavor. The Tuna Tartare spring roll is light and crispy, the chili rock shrimp is flavorful and sweet, the boneless spare ribs are tasty and the Shanghai soup dumplings (although extremely overpriced compared to Joe's Shanghai/Ginger) is worth the $14. They are light on the soup but heavy on flavor. I got the Charred Filet of Beef, which was delicious. It was well-made and not too heavy. A friend got the Hot & Sour Scallops, which although were very tasty (trusting his judgement since I didn't dare ask to try), but the portion was miniscule. Only two not-very-sizable scallops. The Sweet & Crispy Jumbo Shrimp was wonderful as well. It was a friend's birthday dinner so we ordered a cake and two bottles of wine, that greatly contributed to $80 per person for an eight person table.

Upon entrance there's a lift to your left that takes you the 3 or 4 feet to the main level. One time the lift was broken. The manager was waiting at the front to explain and apologize. 2 or 3 large guys (way more than enough) were waiting as well to help me up the stairs. No problem. There's a very accessible bathroom on this level and a lot of different, cool areas to dine. I've never gone 'downstairs' and I'm not sure if there's a way down.

My. Goodness. This meal was out of control. Boyfriend's dad and step-mom took us here last month for an absolutely fabulous dinner. We were joined by Boyfriend's sister, step-sister and her boyfriend, so the waitress offered us the option of getting one their three tasting menus. Overwhelmed by the thought of ordering the proper amount of food for the table ala carte, we opted to get the second tier tasting menu, which was $80 per person, plus an extra $15 for the additional peking duck course. This would have been plenty of food as it was, but we actually ended up getting two extra appetizers and a salad on the house. Boyfriend's dad has an epic sesame allergy, and there were three or four things on the standard menu that he couldn't eat. Instead of offering substitutions, or having a separate course for him, they the waitress actually brought enough of the extra dishes, (described as some of their \"premium items\"), for all of us! Talk about amazing service. She was also there every step of the way to make sure that he knew which dishes he could and could not eat. As for the food itself, I can't tell you the last time I was treated to such an endless parade of delicious and interesting dishes. Lists are boring, but everything on this one was really good: we got the taro lollipops, cantonese spring rolls, edamame dumplings, jade shrimp dumplings, tuna tartare spring rolls, beef lettuce cups, peking duck, peking duck salad, crispy calamari salad with green apple and cashew, chilled sesame udon noodles with lime sorbet, asian green stir fry, szechuan crusted rib eye steak, glazed Alaskan black cod, sweet and crispy jumbo shrimp, plus what was probably their entire dessert menu.I'll describe a few of the standouts in detail. The beef lettuce cups were great, just a little bite of beautifully charred medium rare steak with lettuce. The edamame dumplings just melted in your mouth and dissolved there, and were like a little bundle of delicious pea soup. I especially loved the cold sesame udon noodles with lime sorbet, which is definitely not the sort of dish I would have expected to like, but the lime and peanut flavors somehow worked really well together, and the thick udon noodles were deliciously chewy. This was definitely the most unexpected dish in my opinion. One really simple dish that packed in a lot of flavor was the asian green stir fry. I just love really fresh and simple veggies, so this was a favorite of mine. It would have been the star of the entree round were it not for the glazed black cod, which was soft and flakey and deliciously sweet. My other favorite fish dish came earlier in the tuna tartare spring rolls appetizer, which was another unexpected treat. I love raw tuna sushi, but who would have thought to pair the rich meaty fish with a crunchy spring roll shell? So good! The only dessert that I couldn't get enough of was the crying chocolate cake, with its delicious white ganache tears. Don't leave without getting it.The other dishes were all tasty, but were less memorable. For instance, the rib eye was great, but it was not as unusual as some of the other things we were served. And though we all enjoyed the peking duck course, it was a very traditional take on the dish, and you'd be just as well served ordering it at an old school Chinese restaurant for much less. On the other hand, the accompanying peking duck salad was more original yet its inspiration was still evident, so I'd recommend ordering that if you want some duck with your dinner. All in all, everything was pretty much great, and I felt like a giant pig from eating so many different things. It was fun, but I'd probably order less were I lucky enough to go back.I would highly recommend Buddakan for your next special occasion. Its such a dramatic setting, with wonderfully accommodating service and phenomenal food presented impeccably. Our bill may have been obscenely large, but if you order ala cart I actually think the individual prices are fairly reasonable. If you like Asian food and aren't afraid to mess with traditional flavors, Buddakan is sure to surprise and amaze you with its wonderfully unique dishes.", "Date": "2010-04-20", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Susan Y.", "ReviewID": "QVi4T0w3vL417TAabF8DUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Awesome service and great atmosphere!! Our waitress was so friendly and was so patient with us. Though I detected a slight urgency, my party and I had a good time overall. It's family style- from what the waitress said. We also were advised to order everything at once. \u00a0So the five of us, picked several side dishes, rice, lomein, spinach, etc., appetizers and entrees. The sides weren't small. It was a good portion for the five of us. We started off with drinks. Jealousy and Tranquility is quite good. Stick with Tranquility if you don't want something overly sweet. Charm was alright, it was basically a prosecco garnished with a few berries. Not worth it. We then had tuna spring rolls. They only come with three- but were amazing! Raw tuna tartar (spicy tuna) wrapped in crispy thin wafer like spring rolls, they were a great start and complimented the drinks. Scallion Pancakes were't worth it. They were cold by the time it got to our table. I couldn't even tell it was scallion pancake. Our sides came out rather quickly. We had the seafood fried rice (house special) and shrimp lobster chow fun, wok roasted water spinach, minced pork lo mein ( pickled cucumbers gave the dish an extra zing! very flavorful and not greasy). We were full by sharing all the rice and lomein dishes on top of appetizers! It wasn't greasy but I feel like you could've easily went to a chinatown restaurant and gotten the same food for a fraction of the price. The entrees were a different story. We had the charred filet of beef, medium rare, drizzled with the soy butter sauce. AMAZINGGGGG. We had to fight each other for the last piece. It was so tender and well worth it!!! The wonton potatoes- what the hell was that.. it's just basic potato chips! Sweet and Crispy Jumbo shrimp was delicious!! We also shared the lobster, rather small, I don't recommend it as a \"family style\" dish. It came with white asparagus and bok choy that were marinated in a delicate sweet and tangy sauce. The lobster was alright.. I think you could get something so much better. Desserts were the crying chocolate and the Chocolate Mille Feuille. I liked the spiced chocolate sorbet that was accompanied with the avocado sauce in the Mille Feuille. Avocados and chocolate?? Who knew? I love them both, and what a great pairing. I wonder when other restaurants will start incorporating this into their menus. The banana brulee w. dark choc. shavings weren't that good in my opinion. I'm not a fan of bananas and chocolate but like I said, the avocado sauce was out of this world!! The crying chocolate was like any other molten chocolate cake, cute decor- but TINY. Well.. there you go. My feast at Buddakan. Excuse me while I run to the bathroom and puke myself silly.. Overall good night, good drinks. Nice crowd.

This was a birthday party dinner, our birthday boy was excited about thus restaurant and his birthday. We were a table of 7. And of course 2 of our party were late. The restaurant was somewhat hard to find being that it was all black, and the sign was in black, so you couldn't see it if you were across the street. The people working near the door and desk were all dressed in black, and when I arrived ignored me. I had to speak to another girl at the desk to ask her where the bar was. Once inside at the bar, me and my friends had a drink, one drink to be exact. Our waitress carded us, to which she said she did this to everyone. Maybe because we were graduate students and still had the stench of school with us. But she was delightfully funny. I had the Charm drink, for $12. They finally sat us 20 minutes later, placing our cocktails on a tray and led us downstairs, though they did rush us as we were trying to settle our tab at the bar. We were lead downstairs, we were amazed at the decor and how dim and dark it was. They sat us at the huge table, many people had said it reminded them of harry potter. The bathroom was insanely dark. The ladies room was pitch black, everything was black, they had 3 separate rooms for stalls, but it was dark in there, you couldn't really see what you were doing. The only light was a small beam of light shooting down to the sink. There was no way you could apply lipstick or see if you had food in your teeth, let alone know if you didn't tuck your skirt into your pantyhose....other patrons there complained about the absolute darkness of it.But back to the food. The waitress explained to us that they serve things family style there, and that everyone would take from the dishes, and that no one would have an individual plate. For the birthday boy he was happy because it meant he would be able to try many different dishes. We ended up ordering, the jumbo shrimp, hot and sour scallops, Peking duck, Mongolian lamb chops, side of fried rice, calamari appetizers, and corn and crab balls. We figured that would be enough if we were sharing and also considering how much they were charging us per plate. The calamari came out, and it was tempura like, but fluffy, airy and tasty. It was when the crab corn cakes came out that the trouble started and we could feel we were in trouble. There were not enough appetizers for 7 people. so we split them in half and had a little taste and that was the theme for the rest of the night. As the other dishes came out we could see they were not proportioned for family style. The food was great. The jumbo shrimp, they decided to downscale from the last review of 5 to 4. There were 4 shrimp for 7 people. Then the scallops came. there were 3. Now if you were just one person, and this was your entree I think you'd be somewhat upset at the fact that there are only 3 scallops, clearly not enough for you to be full on or satisfied. The lamb chops were three, with three small pieces of baby bock choi. They were ginger crusted and quite tasty for the small piece i was able to sample. The Peking duck that they claim to be a whole duck, clearly was not a whole duck, they even plated it nicely, but you could tell it was not a whole duck. They seem to think if you make things smaller people will find them cuter. The side of fried rice was somewhat decent, it was something everyone could eat somewhat. It wasn't anything spectacular. Needless to say at the end of this, we were not full, and not amused. When the waitress said family style we thought it implied that it would be somewhat enough for everyone to eat, but apparently the portions showed that it was barely enough for one person to eat. 3 scallops? 4 shrimp? 3 lamb chops? cmon! unless you have a eating disorder or have had your stomach binded or stapled you're not going to get full here unless you order 2 or more entrees. and at that price you might as well go elsewhere.as for the cake? well apparently a cake much like wine gets a fee. the cake slicing fee was $3 a slice, and that would have been a whole other entree! \u00a0Their desserts looked very well plated and were at least $10 and up and we were tempted to get some but after we heard the cake cutting fee we decided to leave. When the bill came for our small portions, they had already decided to include a 20% tip! Now we were overcharged for food that barely fed us, \u00a0they refused our birthday boy's cake, and they had the audacity to add 20% into our bill! Needless to say, we paid the bill to the exact penny and took our birthday boy's cake elsewhere. Though it was lovely for decor and atmosphere, the portions of the food were appalling. Its filled with wannabe hipsters and trendsters, ugh they don't know what real asian food tastes like, and again the portions are small, the booze is great, and the bathrooms are dark as hell.

Buddakan is am imposing black brick building on 9th Avenue, with just a small sheet metal sign with Buddakan written in many different fonts.

We were there on a Friday night and let me tell you this place was PACKED!!!! My girlfriend could have easily gotten pregnant from how close people were standing together. Believe me, this is a place to be seen,( and yes it is trendy, but who cares!!) it was filled with businessmen in expensive suits and stunning young women. We had a drink at the bar, which serves every brand of top-shelf liquor imagineable, and then we were quickly seated. Buddakan is absolutely gigantic( Buddakan occupies the space which was once a Nabisco factory) and is decorated beautifully. The waitstaff was extremely attentive and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. One thing, I suggest to do( especially if you are on a date) is to order a few appetizers and split an entree( it keeps the price down for one thing and you get more of a range of the menu, instead of ordering an entree each). The food here is PHENOMENAL, they only use the best ingredients and you can easily tell that they spare no expense( I suggest the General Tso's dumplings ,boneless spare ribs, and the tea smoked chicken). The desserts are equally excellent and there are many choices to pick from. Overall, it was a very pleasurable experience and my girlfriend paid me back handsomely for taking her there.

If I had a table in the lounge I would only have dessert and drinks there for sure.The food is good but not everything is finger-licking good.", "Date": "2011-12-09", "Author_Location": "Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"}, {"Author": "Thomas W.", "ReviewID": "z3TGpJRq0nfV-y45yQzP0g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "favorite restaurant!!!!!!i am a regular i make it there at least once or twice a monthi can not pick one specific thing to order because i order differently every time i am there but man o man it is all soooooooo gooooooodddd!!!!!!!!if your just visiting nyc i suggest you not leave without getting to buddakan!!!!!if you live in the city and have not tried buddakan yet......then you have been slacking!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "2013-11-27", "Author_Location": "Long Island, NY"}, {"Author": "Grant H.", "ReviewID": "i3ieVKe5aWrj0AjmfF9uvw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great atmosphere, wonderful staff, and good food.

We still waited standing for over an hour for our table. The waitstaff was polite and knowledgable of the menu. The waitstaff was not patient with us we felt rushed to order. Waitress came back to our table several times to ask if we were ready to order. The food came out as it was ready so it never seemed like we were all eating at the same time. The waitress never came back to ask us if everything was ok or if everyone received the correct order. There was also confusion on the part of the staff as to who ordered what?. Plates were placed at the center of the table for us to figure out. There was no sense of urgency we were celebrating a birthday and our birthday girl didn't feel special. I wanted to order another appetizer and I had to order it through one of the food runners delivering our food due to the waitress not being fully attentive to us. We ordered dessert and coffee when she finally came back around. Waitress never asked us how was our dinning experience so far. The dessert came our birthday girl did recieve a very nice dessert I didn't check on the bill if it was complimentary. The bill arrived before the final course did. It seemed like every employee that passed wanted the bill. I was asked on 4 different occasions by 4 different people if the bill was ready. We felt rushed once again. We paid our $600 plus bill and walked to the bathroom. Upon exiting the bathrooms we stopped for pictures at the large mural in the bathroom area. We had a man behind us the whole time I don't know if he was security. He kept saying \"guys let's wrap this up and move you guys upstairs and to the exit\" it could of been nothing but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. This man walked behind us all the way to the exit wich was kind of creepy people in my party were bothered by this. Overall we had a good time it is a very nice place and a great place to look at beautiful people. The food was not anything to die for I described it as glorified Chinese food. Slightly over priced. Glad it's over probably won't return here and I won't recommend it. I have been in the F&B business I have worked at Le Cirque and for chef Daniel Boulud.

So we decided to go for 5:45pm. First, we got lost because Buddakan shares an address with the Chelsea Market something or other. When we finally walked up to the doorway, we were greeted by a few people dressed all in black. They seemed to be blocking the door, so we nervously asked for permission to enter...As usual, at least two members of our party were extremely late, so three of us sat in the front room perusing the cocktail and appetizer menu. None of us had come here before, so we were a bit apprehensive of the prices (all three of us are Chinese-American, and it's always painful to pay exorbitant amounts of money for \"Asian fusion\" cuisine). Luckily, the overstaffed front desk people (seriously, do they need 8 girls behind the counter??) let us keep our reservations despite our late guests.The architecture is quite nice, and the ambiance is also very mellow (read: it's pretty dark). The hostess warned all the women that many others have stumbled down the somewhat hazardous steps leading down to the dining area, which resembled a grand banquet hall. She requested that we all hold on to the banister as we headed down to our table.Once seated, we were pretty puzzled as to why we couldn't make reservations for 7pm like we had wanted to. It wasn't as packed as we expected it to be. By the time we left it was almost 9pm, and business had picked up a little bit, but I'm pretty sure we would have been able to make a 7pm reservation without any problem.Our waitress seemed nice at first, although we were pretty disappointed with her in the end. She explained to us what family style dining was (as if the 4/5 Chinese-Americans at the table didn't know what it meant). Because we were all college/graduate students, we were fine with ordering the noodle and rice side dishes and forgoing the expensive \"entree\" dishes. Once we had made the order, the waitress had the audacity to tell us that we probably wouldn't have enough food if we didn't order entrees. She told us that she would come back once we decided on some entrees (basically, she was telling us that we weren't spending enough money on our dinner).So, we ordered the tea smoked chicken and the sweet & crispy jumbo shrimp entrees, along with a rice or noodle dish for each person (crab fried rice, vegetable fried rice, Chinese sausage fried rice, roast pork lo mein, mao poe tofu). When our dishes arrived we almost started laughing. The rice and noodle dishes are definitely enough food for one person. The entree dishes had the teeniest portions. The shrimp entree had 5 shrimps, just enough for each person in our party to have one. The food was decent, but not great, and we were truly unhappy that our waitress had bamboozled us into paying an extra $50 for two teeny portions of food. The Mabo Tofu (however they spell it) is not as amazing as we heard it was (I thought it was pretty bland). The veggie fried rice was okay, not great, and I thought the coconut curry foam was weird. Needless to say, the waitress did not get a good tip. As for the five \"side dishes\" we ordered, we were unable to finish the large amount of food and ended up doggy-bagging the rest of it. So much for not having enough food...Basically, I was disappointed with the flavors of the food. I have had better dishes from hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurants. It's not worth the money unless you're there for the pretentiousness of a trendy spot. Perhaps I'll find a good Asian Fusion restaurant one day...The bathrooms are pretty neat, though, if you can figure out which side is which.The final verdict?

Most of the tables were empty when we arrived anyway so I don't understand why they couldn't push our reservation later by half an hour.

The filling is very creamy and most suitable for my palate as it wasn't too salty. Chili Rock Shrimp - Another signature dish. Although it was very good (I love spicy food and I love seafood) it was a touch too salty.Entrees:Charred Filet of Beef - Signature dish again. Absolutely tender filet mignon with a garlic sauce that was not overpowering.Glazed Alaskan Black Cod - Another signature dish. Very soft flaky and the fish itself is naturally sweet so it was very delicious.Shacha Chicken - \u00a0Most of the chicken was tender although some pieces were a bit dry. I liked the bbq sauce that was underneath it though.Cauliflower Stir Fry - Mainly ordered this because I wanted a vegetable dish. Wasn't my favorite but it wasn't bad.Sides:Dungeness Crab Sticky Rice - Nothing too special as I've had this at real chinese restaurants and they make it better but it wasn't bad at all.Wild Mushroom Chow Fun - Ordered this because the five of us were still hungry after eating all the other food. It was piping hot when it came out which is exactly the way I like my hot food. Again it was a touch too salty but it might not be so for others.Desserts: Almond Bread Pudding w/ Whiskey ice cream - Very sweet, decadent, and delicious.Crying Chocolate w/ Jasmine Tea ice cream - My cousin got this so I didn't taste the chocolate cake but was told it was like a chocolate lava cake. I wish I could buy the Jasmine Tea ice cream separately because I love tea and this was so yummy.Vanilla Rhubarb Shortcake - Don't know how to feel about this because it was basically a twinkie covered in sauce and a small shortcake.

The pancakes and the short ribs were tasty but the meat was a bit too cold when the dish arrived at the table. The tuna spring rolls were my favorite, although the dough around the fish threw me off...as I always thought egg rolls were friend and spring rolls were not. However, still very, very tasty!We followed up with one Asian sausage fried rice, the sweet and sour chicken and the spiced tofu. I would recommend skipping the tofu dish as the tofu itself was spongy, flavorless and soggy and the veggies a bit too oily. The sweet and sour chicken was good but lacked flavor (think boiled chicken...watery). The fried rice was def. my favorite and the fact that it was a huge dish didn't hurt either.

They seated us at the large communal table located in the center of the restaurant -- a swanky and fun atmosphere. This is where Carrie Bradshaw and Mr. Big's engagement party was filmed in the first SATC movie!! The restaurant was fairly busy as it was a Saturday night, but our staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The decor was fabulous and darkly lit with high ceilings and gorgeous chandeliers. Dress code: Most girls were wearing dresses/skirts or jeans with heels and most guys were in slacks and a dress shirt. We started by having the specially created birthday cocktail! They began bringing out the food almost immediately after. Everything was served family style. For appetizers, we started with edamame dumplings, cantonese chicken and shrimp spring rolls, general tso's dumplings and a calamari salad. The edamame dumplings were fried but not too oily. The calamari salad had green apples, cashews and miso vinaigrette - perfect blend of flavors. The General tso dumplings were sweet and tangy, and dipped in a hot & sour broth. We were already pretty full from all the delicious appetizers when the main course started rolling out! For the entrees, we had:1. sizzling short ribs - they were cooked how I like them (well done), not too dry, not too moist -- just right. 2. sweet & crispy jumbo shrimp - my guests said they were delicious, I'm allergic so I can't comment on the shrimp. 3. shacha 5-spice barbeque chicken - the bbq chicken was tender, moist, mildly spicy and paired well with the lo mein and vegetable rice. 4. hot & sour scallops with sweet corn, tofu & black mushrooms - the scallops were yum!5. minced pork lo mein and vegetable (side) - great lo mein, wasn't greasy, and it served as the perfect side6. vegetable rice with coconut curry foam - rice with coconut curry, standard thai combination, it was deliciousMy favorites were the chicken, scallops and lo mein.They gave us 3 chef-selected desserts:1. golden carrot cake with black raisin plum sauce and caramelized cream cheese2. \"crying chocolate\" malted white chocolate ganache with a side of jasmine tea ice cream3. peanut butter bar with char siu peanuts, sweet and sour cherry sauce, and horlicksI can't decide on a favorite dessert because they were all to-die-for!Overall, the planning process was smooth and stress-free, the service was impeccable, and most importantly, the food was AMAZING.

We arrived a little earlier than the time we reserved for and they were full so we went to the lounge to have a few drinks and wait. The male bartender was friendly while the female bartender seemed annoyed that my boyfriend was asking her the name of the drink she was making for someone else :-/ I ordered the \"Fever\" cocktail and he ordered the \"Solid\" which were both great. However, my boyfriend found a piece of blond hair in his drink (the only person we saw working with blond hair happened to be our waitress who brought the drink over to us) and when he took it to the bar they gave him a bit of an attitude but replaced it. Like it was his fault someones hair was in his drink or he placed it there to make their lives miserable lol pathetic (I have black hair). Anyway, we also ordered the \"General Toss Dumplings\" and they were delicious, beware though, they are a bit soupy inside so when you dig in, they pop and might splash on you. The only complaint, I felt like they were a little cold but didn't want to complain since they gave such attitude for the drink earlier. When we were seated, we were greeted by our waiter (so mad I can't remember his name!) but he was absolutely wonderful. He was not snobby or slacking at all. The floor manager who was walking around stopped and spoke to us a few times and was also very pleasant, even got down on the ground with his flashlight to help me find my earring back when it slipped out :-) lol. So we ordered the Garlic Lobster (nice big lobster cut up and sauteed/tasty but a little too much garlic for my taste), the Charred Filet of Beef with a spicy mayo-like sauce and mustard (delicious but on the small side) and the Lobster Fried Rice (not a fan, rice was a bit hard and very bland/bf thought it was fine). After dinner, our table was cleared and we were brought a banana bread dessert with bananas, ice cream, \u00a0cookies which read \"Happy Anniversary\" on one, \"Congradulations\" on another, \"Happy Birthday\" on the last, and candles. I thought it was very well presented, and the dessert was delicious. I made my reservation to the restaurant on opentable.com and noted that we were celebrating his bday and our anni & any kind gesture would be appreciated and I am am thankful for the way the dessert came out, my boyfriend thought it was a sweet little surprise. Howeverrrrr, (lol) I thought it was lame that they charged $10 for the dessert. Over all, it was a pleasant experience and the food was decent, I won't mind going back and hanging out in the lounge but I'm not in a rush to go back.

The space is quite large for a Manhattany type restaurant...Now, I decided to have a sales meeting dinner here based on our food from last time - this is one of the best peking duck I've ever had matched with the lobster fried rice which is quite good. Their tuna tartar appetizers are quite good too...the food here for that super fusiony pan asiany type of foodie in YOU, will be satisified.Now here is my gripe - my brother in law is a complete vegetarian for most of his life - 25-30+ years, (no meat, fish or poultry) and the first time we went, he noticed meat in his dish although he had asked it without. They rectified the situation and brought out a new dish...so he was there last night too and he had ordered a mushroom dish which doesn't have meat to begin with, only for it to be laden with BEEF. Yes folks, BEEF in a dish that doesn't even contain it based on the description in the menu! Needless to say, what my brother in law thought was sliced mushrooms, turned out to be BEEF as it was quite dark and one couldn't tell the difference in a bite with other items. This was COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE for this to happen a 2nd time, at which point several managers etc came to our table and comped our ENTIRE dinner for 4 people including champagne, an entire dessert spread etc. We realized that this was NOT the waitress' fault, so we tipped her $100 cash, and left with our entire $500-600+ dinner comped...I'd like to reiterate one last time, that the dish isn't even supposed to have beef in it, but the chefs decide to just add random ingredients in, this particular case from a moo-cow, which doesn't bode well for a vegetarian to say the least.Needless to say, we will NOT be returning here ever again...atleast not with my brother in law. I'm giving this 2 stars because the food is good, and the place is awesome, but for them to screw up TWICE in a row? unacceptable folks.

I remember always wondering where the rehearsal took place because it seemed like such a cool place, and when I finally found out where it was I knew I had to eat there, especially since I would be spending the day at Chelsea Market! \u00a0Reservation made, I was set to go! \u00a0I arrived promptly and alerted the woman in the reception area of my reservation, and she asked me to wait in the lounge and that I would be greeted shortly and taken to my table. \u00a0I decided not to order a drink since I would be driving back to RI as soon as I finished my meal, and I've heard (through the grapevine) that drinking and driving is illegal, and also a bad idea. \u00a0So yeah, I didn't get a drink... even though I really wanted one. \u00a0I ordered tea instead. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0It wasn't spiked.Mere moments after I sat down in the lounge (and checked my Facebook application on my Crackberry, killing time), I was escorted to my cozy table for 1 with a fabulous view of the lower level where Carrie and Big had their fancy schmancy rehearsal dinner :) \u00a0Okay, yes I'm obsessed. \u00a0Moving on... to the food. \u00a0I decided to get a few appetizers instead of having an entree. \u00a0First, I opted for the Lobster Egg Rolls, which quite frankly were a no brainer. \u00a0I mean, lobster? \u00a0Egg rolls? \u00a0They really are the real deal! \u00a0I bit into one (piping hot!) and the piece of lobster was so big that the whole piece (which was running the length of the entire egg roll) just came out. \u00a0I happily ate my now deconstructed egg roll with equal enjoyment as the put-together variety.My next decadent appetizer was also in fried form, but this had a cold filling :) Very unique! \u00a0For the Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls they fried the spring roll wrappers in a cylindrical shape and then later filled them with the tuna tartare filling. \u00a0These were yummy as well! \u00a0I love the crisp, fried exterior with the soft, slightly spiced tuna filling.My third and last choice was the Scallion Pancakes with Braised Beef Short Rib. \u00a0It sounded magnificent, but turned out to be somewhat disappointing. \u00a0Let me clarify, the dish didn't taste bad at all, it had a nice crisp texture to the pancake with perfectly cooked short rib covering it and crispy sour apple juliennes on top, but the flavors just weren't as bold as I'd expect. \u00a0When I pictured a braised short rib topped scallion pancake, I imagined the beef would have a very Asian-inspired flavoring, a special kick, but there was nothing. \u00a0It tasted like simply seasoned short ribs, nothing standing out. \u00a0They were also so beefy, that they masked the scallion pancake from standing out at all, and the dish is marketed as a scallion pancake first, and then lists the accompaniments in smaller lettering. \u00a0Although I ate this dish, and didn't regurgitate it afterward, I wouldn't order it again. \u00a0It just didn't stand out. \u00a0There are SO many other menu items that I wanted to try and next time those will hopefully satisfy me more than this dish, which wasn't a home run for me... sorry.In the future I really would like to return, decked out, cocktail in hand, and really make more of a night of it, but for my needs the other night, a satisfying meal and sustenance was a #1 priority. \u00a0Maybe next time I will have a 5 star experience as opposed to a 4 star one, with a replacement to the somewhat disappointing scallion pancakes, some more time spent enjoying the space, and a perusal of the cocktail menu :) \u00a0I look forward to that next visit, and there's sure to be more :) \u00a0And next time I don't plan on having to drive for 3 hours afterward!", "Date": "2010-05-15", "Author_Location": "Cranston, RI"}, {"Author": "Jason M.", "ReviewID": "WwYxoyZ_gjH0WehLV5Ovqw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the better dining experiences in all of NYC. \u00a0The food is excellent, and totally price-worthy. \u00a0You will not break the bank dining here, for two. \u00a0It's an amazing combination. \u00a0Atmosphere and decor are top notch here.", "Date": "2010-10-21", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Annette V.", "ReviewID": "LkzvXAux5jre4rvsZofdhA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say?

When we asked how long that might take, she could not provide us with an answer, but rather something that sounded as if she was reading off a cue card - \"I hesitate to give a time estimate...\" and then said we could eat in the lounge if we got \"ansy.\" Ansy?

The upstairs is more bustling and crowded so it's a very dine-with-a-group kind of feel. Downstairs is dimmer, and more sensual, which is where we sat because I'm a sensual kinda gal. Our waiter, Owen seems out of place, mustache and slight twang of an accent and all, but he's one of the best servers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He was kind, informative, gracious, but not overly attentive or trying too hard to make the service seem 5 star or formal. The food: -Glazed Black Cod Miso: very good flavors here, the grilled eggplant on the side and salted cucumbers were slight and balanced out the hint of sweetness in the fish. However, my friend and I weren't huge fans of the fish itself; we like our fish dry and flaky, this was oily and moist. Order it if you like your cod wet. (ooh baby). -Charred Filet Beef: looks are deceiving. My eyes were visually underwhelmed by this boring looking dish with a sad piece of beef on it and \u00a0bowl of taro chips in the middle. But, lo and behold, it was cooked PERFECTLY medium-rare and oh, that gravy. I'm not a fan of gravy but I'd slather this buttery, delicious gravy on all my Thanksgiving turkeys if I could.-Shrimp&Lobster Chow Fun: jumbo shrimp, chunks of lobster meat, veggies, and savory chow fun. This dish is salty, but it adds a much needed carb dish to our dinner, and the portion is generous.-Mapo Tofu: My Szechuan grandma would slap me silly knowing I paid $20+ for mapo tofu but this was some interesting flavored mapo tofu. It was served in a simple bowl with an even simpler bowl of white rice accompanying it. It was a bit spicy, a bit salty, a bit tangy (that was the kicker), and very flavorful. Strangely enough, it was the most authentically Chinese dish of our meal.I would compare this place to Spice Market in ambiance (quite large, impressive decor, has a good balance of fun and sexy), but with better food, and a mixture of Tao for cuisine, only better, and no tourists or kids running around.

(i know, i've stopped trying to figure out how much money i spent as i was present at every event.)let me start with the establishment itself. it's incredible that such an understated entrance leads into a (super cool) dungeon that has a bar and spiral staircase down into the bigger dining area. think the hogwarts dining hall for adults. yes, it's true, i got to eat at the very table where carrie bradshaw had her rehearsal dinner (youtube.com/watch?v=ZOGQ\u2026), and yes, it was just that breathtaking.to start off (that's misleading as we spent the entire evening getting refills), we had the tranquility beverage:: citrus vodka paired with lemongrass-infused oolong tea. definitely tranquil..until about the fourth glass..then it's just all giggles. my affection towards the special beverage has since won me the nickname \"quill\" with the girls.get the edamame dumplings. the soft shells are penetrated with a shallot-sauternes broth that reminded me of shanghai's xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and warmed the cockles.we then shared the beef lettuce cups (with puffed rice and pickled tomato salad), steamed sea bass roll (with cabbage, ginger, and sizzling scallion oil), and minced pork lo mein (with pickled cucumbers and thai chilies). all very flavorful and held their own.of course, we couldn't leave without indulging in a couple desserts. the crying chocolate (with malted white ganache coffee ice cream) was beyond decadent and really demonstrated chocolate's aphrodisiac powers. berry cloud, on the other hand, was a strawberry-calamansi (but incorrectly spelled \"kalamanzi\" on their menu..boo!) sorbet with green tea and tickled the senses with its fresh and flirty tartness.all in all, an amazing experience, and the waitstaff is on point. i removed a star because it's awkward sitting at the large table with a first date going on (literally) beside you and a rollicking gaylebration (the studly men told me i could call it that) on the other side of your party. and i get it..we could've chosen *not* to sit at the large table..but that chair i sat in puts me at one degree of separation from charlotte! or stanford! or mr big! so i'm not complaining. yep, samantha's buttcheeks and mine could've indirectly touched. i'd be jealous, too. the removal of a star is also due the disappointing state of the restroom. toilet paper and paper towel strewn about..poor form.but still..if i can make a reservation FOR 1030pm and walk out on MY own terms at 3am..that's golden right there, folks. i'm positive buddakan has and will continue to provide for awesome memories to all who visit.", "Date": "2010-12-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Omer N.", "ReviewID": "nE0785Y71cYmDchbC1WjgA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HUGE!

I've always wanted to come here and there we go.. Getting a reservation is easy if you decide to have an earlier dinner like before 7pm or after 10pm since people tend to eat during peak dinner hours. \u00a0I managed to get a reservation at 7:15pm on New years day for a party of 3 which is like suprising since it was a last minute thing. whoopiee..The Place is awesome; \u00a0once you enter the place, you feel like you are in a buddhist monastery in the middle of Bhutan with fake books on the side as fixtures. The bright yellow colors along with the jumbo size buddha pictures all over the main dining room along with a huge chandelier makes you want to say to yourself, \" what the hell am I doing here for dinner?\" . For the starters, My two guests had the Crispy Calamari Salad, spare ribs and the Chili Rock shrimp. I had the Vegan dumplings. The Crispy Calamari Salad was pretty good; a sizeable plate with at least 10 pieces of fried calamari and it was actually crunchy and not heavy as some other places would serve this salad. The Chili Rock Shrimp is to die for. Not to heavy or light the shrimp and the miso dressing just melts into your mouth. soooo good. As for the ribs, my two guests deemed it was beyond good but looking at the ribs for me makes me want to puke since I don't eat pork. ( even if i ate pork i would of not liked it because they only had 3 little ribs on the plate wtfff). As for the dumplings go, they were pretty decent. They were not overly stuffed like chinatown dumplings nor they were greasy which is a plus. As for the entrees I ordered the steamed sole and a side order of the asian veggie stir fry. my other two guest decided to order one entree since one of them has a stomach of a 5 year old and decided to order the beef short ribs. The Steamed sole was outrageously good. It was the breaking point for me in determining if this place was actually good or was it just another overly hyped place. The sole was light and flaky which is what the fish should be. It was not drenched in sodium nor did i taste any MSG. the ginger and the green onion made the fish retain it's natural flavors without overpowering the pungent smells of the green onions. \u00a0It was just a work of art. As for the short ribs, I only had a taste of it and it was pretty well made. one big piece of beef rib probably simmered in a pot for hours and served on top of some chow fun noodles.

My first time at Buddakan was when my gf from Cali was visiting, and my 2nd time going there was 2 nights ago with 3 co-workers. I think my 2nd visit was better due to the following: 1) we were seated in the main dining room (downstairs) in a booth seating and that was just amazing! I think that made all the difference in the world. The first time we went. We were seated upstairs in that one area with the windows looking down into the main dining room and just had the feeling, man.. i want to sit down there! So yeah, downstairs seating is great. 2) Our waiter the 2nd time introduced himself as having been working at the restaurant since it opened. He was extremely knowledgeable, helped us put our menu together, and took our drink orders quickly. He recommended a few different drinks and promised that if we didn't like them.. he would take them back. We had a few rounds of the Charm and Fate. Both were yummy and tasted like sparkling wine with fruit infusions, very light and refreshing :) One of my gf's didn't like her mojito.. it was made too strong the first time around, he quickly took it away and brought her a new one, much better. The first time we went.. i remember having the edamame dumplings, tuna tartare springrolls, chili rock shrimp, wild mushroom chowfun, sugar snap peas, king crab hot pot, etc. The other night we had again the edamame dumplings, tuna tartare spring rolls, the potstickers, the whole peking duck, wok tofu and brocolli, lobster fried rice, sizzling short rib and chili crab and crispy noodles. I would say they did a fabulous job on the duck just because it's really hard to get an entire duck de-fatted, and have the skin crispy. The duck wraps were a little too floury for my taste, but it was authentic still in the sense that they brought out the strips of cucumber and green onion. yum! The short rib was really tender and no fat as well! We also ordered for dessert: the crying chocolate, the 5 spice donuts, asian citron souffle, and the choco peanut butter bomb! the desserts were pretty amazing.. the choco peanut butter bomb was yummy with the peanut powder, it tasted like a glorified reese's that melted in your mouth, so if you like peanut butter... crying choco and souffle wasnt that amazing, but the donuts are yummy and unique esp with the pistachio crumbs on the cinnamon icecream! i do like buddakan :)", "Date": "2009-04-23", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Alexandra W.", "ReviewID": "j3i5z4T2acWWhmI89A38Jg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I \u00a0enjoy coming here, ordering delicate food and sipping on a delicious drink.

Our party of 3 was seated promptly in the dining area, which was at the bottom of double grand staircases. Every part of this restaurant was pretty and did I mention sexy? Now onto important stuff - the food. - The appetizer platter sampler was pretty good, a slight twist on dim sum. I would have liked something more savory, instead of fried items, but maybe I was just too hungry...- For the main course, shared family style, we had 4 dishes. The Spicy Crab and Shan Tong Noodles - probably my favorite dish of the night. The dish offered a good amount of heat that surprisingly didn't last in your mouth (I secretly wanted it to last). Loved it! The sizzling short rib was cooked to a perfect tenderness. If I were to give a small suggestion, I would have liked a seared crust on the outside for a more bold flavor. It was still good. We had a newer fish menu item I don't remember the name of... It was a stir fry dish with pieces of fish and vegetables on top of a fried exoskeleton part of the fish. (Hard to explain it) I wasn't wow'd by this dish because the tastes were mediocre. I think it needed some black pepper. I would have preferred the whole fish presented to me like how most Asian restaurants cook their fish. It locks in the flavors and most importantly, the moisture of the fish's meat. I guess they chop it up so people don't complain about deboning the fish themselves. We also had the vegetable rice with coconut foam. - For dessert we had the almond tapioca ice cream sandwich and banana fritters. I was not a fan of the cherries that came with the tapioca ice cream - I prefer fresh fruit instead of the ones you get in a cherry pie. \u00a0I really liked the banana fritters. It was filling and topped off all of insane amount of food I had just ate. At the end -- I was pleased.Our waiter was awesome too.

The food was great though, and I left insanely stuffed. Here's my take on some of the dishes:Cantonese Spring Rolls shrimp, chicken - simple, good, but not exceptionalEdamame Dumplings shallot-sauternes broth \u00a0- I did not love the paste-like texture of the dumpling filling, but the flavor was good Szechuan Pork Dumplings chili-soy broth \u00a0- very good, solid addition to an orderGeneral Tso's Dumplings chicken, hot & sour broth \u00a0 \u00a0- super delicious - you must order these. Peking Duck Salad fris\u00e9e, poached egg, sherry vinaigrette \u00a0 - good light dish that stands out as different on their menu Scallion Pancakes braised beef short rib, green apple \u00a0- the shredded short rib was not that excellent, but the ensemble was really interesting and it worked all togetherChili Rock Shrimp toasted ginger \u00a0- absolutely fabulous - very lightly fried and the sauce is excellent - a definite must order... Black Pepper Beef wok tossed rib eye, crispy bird's nest \u00a0 \u00a0 - very flavorful and delicious. There was a good amount of spice - it was one of the more intense dishes in terms of flavor, but it is definitely on the heavier side. King Crab Hot Pot scallops, shrimp crackers - this dish did not impress me. I find that really well done scallops are excellent, but most of the time, they are just mediocre - and that's what this dish is. Broken Chili Chicken chinese pepper, thai basil - good, but not overly original Shacha Chicken 5-spice barbeque \u00a0- very flavorful and lightly fried. \u00a0Might be my favorite dish Vegetable Rice coconut curry foam - very interesting textures and great flavor.

For starters, \"Asian fusion\" is a term I've heard much of, and it seems like one \"Asian fusion\" joint is opening up every ten minutes on the street corner of the chic area of some American metropolis. This does not mean, however, that the food is bad. Most experiences for me at \"Asian fusion\" joints have been enjoyable, and Buddakan would be no different. When my mom announced that this is where she had reservations to, I asked how she heard about the place. After telling me a friend recommended it, she also stated that this place had been featured on \"Sex and the City.\" Sorry, fans of that show, but I started to doubt if I would enjoy this place upon hearing that. Upon entering Buddakan, I was taken aback by the atmosphere. Very dark in terms of coloring, and full of beautiful young people, who decided to come eat here after they had finished their shopping sprees at the Banana Republic. As a 22 yr old with his two parents, we looked slightly out of place, but I got over it. Remember, it's about food. And good god, the food. We got things going with the pork belly, the lobster egg rolls, and the spare ribs. My favorite was the pork belly, but the other two were also incredibly delicious in their own right. For dinner, we ordered the rib-eye, the fillet, and the lamb chops to all share. The rib-eye was hands down my favorite of the three, but the other two were delicious, especially the lamb chops. The drinks were good, and I was happy that they served Brooklyn lager, which I became a fan of during my trip.

Huge layout \u00a0with two floors and several rooms. I've eaten only downstairs all three times. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Super trendy and hip. You don't have to come swanked out but a lot of people do especially on Fridays and Saturdays.I'll focus more on my second visit for this review because I tried a wider variety of food with my family. Our waiter was great. Very courteous and helpful. He helped us pick a few appetizers which were all excellent. We started off with general tso dumplings, scallion pancakes, and the boneless spare ribs. The dumplings were fantastic. The hot and sour soup in them is a nice surprise to bite into. The ribs were tender and smothered in a delicious sauce, paired with their mustard which is sweet and zingy. The scallion pancakes were great as well! I ordered the Fever cocktail (spicy!) which is definitely one of the more unique cocktails I've ever had. It was a nice addition to my meal.Although the main entrees for this place are intended to be shared, we each ordered one. I ordered the charred filet of beef which was cooked medium, even a little closer to medium rare which is how I prefer my meat. The plating is impeccable here. It arrived with thin and very tasty wonton crisps, their signature mustard, and a savory but sweet sauce that had hints of caramel in it. Needless to say, it was excellent. My sister ordered the black pepper beef which comes in a beautiful, delicate \"birds nest.\" The beef was cooked perfectly and there was a delightful crunchy texture in the vegetables accompanying it. My father, mother, and brother ordered sha cha chicken and broken chili chicken. I didn't try either of these but they were happy with their food. To top it off we ordered the summer peach upside down cake and the bittersweet chocolate mousse pave. The summer peach upside down cake is possibly the greatest dessert I've ever had. The cake was buttery, delicate, and moist. The egg custard ice cream is brulee'd on top and melts nicely with the cake. The bittersweet chocolate mousse pave is not really bittersweet but still amazing. The caramel popcorn sherbet is out of this world. My family still raves about it, months after their visit there. The bill was a little scary but its nice to splurge on a good meal every now and then. My father thought it was well worth it.

We got there a few minutes early for our reservation (which we made a month ahead of time to garuntee our time slot/day we wanted during the holiday) So we were seated in the lounge. My sister and I started off w/ the Charm cocktail and it was so good, I had to have another after we were seated (only about 10 minutes after our reservation time to my surprise... usually these places are running way behind schedule)We ordered the scallion pancaked for an appetizer. They were small, but packed a lot of flavor.For dinner, I ordered the shrimp and lobster chow fun. The BEST noodles I've ever had, hands down. They were the perfect amount of spicy too. Not a lot of shrimp or lobster, but it was so filling, I could only eat 1/2. My family also ordered the sizzling short rib and black pepper beef. Both very good. For dessert, we ordered the crying chocolate which was warm and gooey after biting in.The service was all very good too. Everyone was so nice and giving... which I also wouldn't expect in a trendy restaraunt like this.If you have friends or family visiting, I def recommend taking them here.

Regardless if you are a Sex & the city fan or not this restaurant is to not be missed! I came here for my 26th birthday with 5 of my friends and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Not only was the food delicious, the drinks crisp & refreshinging... but the ambiance was unbelievable! The decor is not what you typically see & the restaurant is huge! Said to be the biggest space in all of Manhattan. Okay, so now for the review on the food & drinks; first off yes it can get pricey,l but I think that one could go here for a drink & Dim Sum & walk out not spending too much.. because the experience is part of it. My friends and I ordered cocktails from the speciality cocktail menu... we ordered the reflection, Haze, virtue & charm (Cute names, right?), my best friend ordered the reflection & that was hands down my favorite, I think we both had three or four... the others were good as well, but the reflection was special. They have special glasses they are put in, which gives it the extra touch. Now for the food, we ordered a lot of different things, but from what I can remember we ordered: the Bo Bo plate, General Tso's dumplings, Spare ribs, Lobster egg rolls, Minced pork Lo Mein & Chilled Udon noodles. The Bo Bo Plate, which is what I ordered for myself included: Tuna spring rolls, sesame shrimp rolls, boneless spare ribs, carrot dumplings & a cantonese spring roll. Everything was delicious, nothing was ok.. the spare ribs were perfection. The Bo Bo plate is a great option because you can get a little taste of everything. I think this place is great for groups because you can easily share and have a taste of everything and I also think that makes the evening fun when you can share and enjoy dishes together. They even have a communal table which is absolutely stunning with a chadelier that is beyond words. We sat in a room right near it, but my view was towards the communal table, so I was able to really enjoy it. Lastly, for dessert we ordered the bread pudding & they even gave us a dessert for my birthday.. both were incredible, the dessert they gave was just as good, which I was surprised by because normally when its free, its just ok. All in all, great experience, food, pictures & memories... P.S. I do think that this place is just as easily for couples because it is romantic as well.

We sat there for a few minutes, but then went back to find the man and ask for a better table. He told us to wait 20 minutes and within 10 minutes we were very politely taken to what had to be the best seat in the house. A four top in the main downstairs room where the two of us could sit side by side and both face the room. An extremely friendly waiter then came by and helped us select some of the best food we've ever eaten. Really. The frogs leg appetizer and Kung Pao Monkfish were two of the best thing's I've ever eaten anywhere. We order second helpings of both! Other appetizers and entrees we ordered were also great.The place is clearly a business... meaning they move you in, move you out and turn over the table... no table clothes, food arrives as its ready, sit you long enough in the lounge to by a drink before dinner, etc. But, given what their overhead must be in a place that big its understandable, and its done with such tact and class, you barely notice, let alone mind.That was our one experience.

So you can tell I had high expectations for this place as I really needed it to be quite impressive.The moment we entered my gf was already smiling which gives this place a huge plus. We were quickly seated after waiting at a nice bar area for a few minutes.The ambiance of this place is great. A negative I noticed right away was that we were seated very very close to other groups of two to the point where it is easy to hear their conversation completely. I even saw some tables jumping into people's conversations to talk about the food. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing :)Anyway onto the important stuff the food.Appetizers: \u00a0Edamame Dumplings- although this was definitely unique I would say this is very overhyped and overrated. Im glad I tried it but would pass on ordering again. Very mushy \u00a0 Chili Rock Shrimp- hands down best dish here. Very crispy and a great taste as well as great proportions. Felt like it was approaching entree proportions. The shrimp is coated in a nice spicy (mayo?) sauce that is amazing. If you don't like shrimp don't be afraid to try this dish you can't really taste the shrimp flavor youll just taste the delicious flavor.Entrees: \u00a0 Chinese Sausage Fried Rice: this wasnt anything out if the ordinary but wasn't expecting it to be. Served with a sunny side up egg that is recommended to be mashed in with the rice.Mongolian Lamb Chops: Very tender meat with a interesting coating on the side. A sweet yet sharp taste for the coating. Costing sometimes overwhelming but dish good overall. \u00a0 \u00a0Charted Filet Of Beef: This was my gf's favorite dish. The beef was insanely tender and the sauce was just as amazing. I'm unsure what was in the sauce but I'm sure there was some butter which makes the world a tastier place :) definitely get this dish you won't regret it. Never tasted beef as tender as this.Desert: \u00a0 Crying Chocolate: This dish first of all is very atheistically pleasing. It comes with jasmine ice cream and a chocolate lava cake type desert. I could not stop eating this dish despite how many times I told my gf to just finish it and that I was done.Our server was very attentive and always dropped by to make sure everything was going great. As well there were other people around to make sure things were attended to if necessary.Overall this is a great place to go and will definitely impress your date. It is definitely also a great place to go with just your friends as the food is top notch.

Despite everything, the reception staff and managers really went to great lengths to help my group with all our requests. Our server, Jordan, was also really attentive. Food-wise, there are some must-try dishes, and some other ones to skip over. The Scallion Pancakes were good, together with the Carrot Dumplings (interesting mushroom filling, better than the highly acclaimed Edamame Dumplings). The Peking Duck was a good choice, so was the Char Sui Roast Pork and the meat dishes. I would give the Alaskan Black Cod a miss though. It turned cold quickly and wasn't very flavorful. I would also skip the Rice dishes and Asian Green Stir Fry - definitely not Buddakan's strengths. Dessert-wise, try the Clementine Cloud and the Crying Chocolate. Clementine Cloud comes with a variety of light desserts that was a good end to the dinner, and the Chocolate was designed beautifully, tasted pretty good too. The Chocolate Sesame Fondant is pretty dense, so get that as a sharing plate. All in all, a wonderful experience.

The food itself is good - particularly the taro puff lollipops which were served hot with a crispy outside and a warm goey pork filling. \u00a0The scallion pancakes with short ribs were more like crispy thin flatbread with braised short ribs and scallion on top - but it was delicious. The lobster dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary though. We also tried the NY strip served with tomatos and crispies - it was good, but again, nothing special. The black cod and the snapper, though typical sounding were actually delicious and well accented by the other complementary aspects of the dish susch as the mushrooms and the radish. In terms of dessert - we ordered the chocolate mille feuille with caramelized banana and a kaffir lime tart that came with some sort of a lime souffle and gelato - I highly recommend the lime dessert because the lime souffle and gelato were irresistable.

Walk inside through the doors of the unimpressive structure and completely get transported to a different world. Stylish, trendy, cool, chic; name it, Buddakan is it. Music is played at a very reasonable level so conversation can still be kept but the tone and mood are still right. what really differentiates Buddakan for me though is the friendly service. Its hard to find a friendly face in meatpacking on the weekend, so the great service and smiling faces are a welcome change. The Asian fusion food is really well presented and never disappoints. Another obvious plus is that the main dining room and table were features in Sex and the City, so its always fun to take a fan of the series and the movies here for the first time.

I've always liked the whole discrete entrance idea when it comes to unique establishments so I immediately apprecicated the subtlety of the door tucked away just off the corner of 16th St and 9th Ave. We were greeted at a formal counter seperated from the rest of the space, a slightly different concept than your usual restaurant podium. After checking our coats we were escorted to a beautiful corner table in the grand baroque room overlooking the central dining area which was simply spectacular! Buddakan is like many different worlds in one. There are several rooms and spaces of different colors, design and themes that all surround the main dining room made up of high ceilings and gorgeously ornate wooden walls. This week I decided to take an easier approach to ordering from the menu. We faithfully placed everything in our waiter's hands and asked him to select the best Buddakan's cuisine had to offer. Luckily we didn't have any dietary needs which made for a vast selection of options and here is what we got: Shrimp Dumplings filled with Egg Drop Broth, Scallions and Bamboo Shoots, this appetizer was incredible. The broth was like a tasty soup hiding inside the dumpling filled with rich flavor. My second favorite appetizer was the Tuna Spring Rolls with Crisp Shallots and Chili Mayonnaise, they were delicious. The entree that I enjoyed the most was the Charred Fillet of Beef with Wanton Potatoes and Mustard Sauce. The meat was excellent and the sauce made it almost taste like candy. Overall I was definitely satisfied with my experience at Buddakan. Our server was charming and as I said before, the space was like a colorful and lounge- like maze.

Out of the upscale/trendy restaurants, this is probably one of my favorites spots. I've been to other places and spent the same $ but have not been as satisfied, either due food being nothing special or service not being super great. Here at Buddakan you get your money's worth every time. The ambiance is great, very trendy/posh, great decor, grand almost as you enter the main dining area. The service has always been excellent....and the food....phenomenal! Every bite ....deeeeelicious! We've had a New Year dinner here once a few years ago with a large group, brought several out of town friends here, and come for drinks with smaller groups of friends & birthday dinners etc. The experience has been great every time. Spot on! Cocktails are great, and even if you have reservations, chances are you will need to wait for a bit before getting your table, so definitely enjoy a drink by the bar & people watch. Great crowd, although due to its ever increasing popularity I do feel it has become a bit more touristy over the last couple of years. But hey, as long as those out-of-towners are spending money & supporting the NYC economy, why complain right? I love their spicy rock shrimp. Have had a variety of their streaks over my several trips & every time it has been cooked to perfection. Your bill can typically run anywhere between $60-$120 per person, depending on how many courses & drinks you order.

We arrived on time for our reservation and were told our table wouldn't be ready for a bit and to grab a drink in the bar. About 30 seconds after puttting in our drink orders, the hostess came to find us and show us to our table. We notified her that we had ordered drinks and asked for them to just be brought to our table. I don't know if this is some weird policy or something but they refused to allow it. We sat there for about 10 minutes with a hostess (awkwardly) standing there on top of us before they brought our drinks. We then had to wait for them to run the credit cards, as they refused to add it to our dinner check. The whole ordeal lasted about 15 minutes and was unnecessarily frustrating. It really started what we hoped to be a nice night out on the wrong foot. Luckily, the food lived up to the hype so the evening was redeemed. We ordered the edamame dumplings, calamari salad, boneless spare ribs, tuna tartar spring rolls, beef lettuce cups and the filet. The edamame dumpling were incredible!! They didn't even taste like edamame to me- \u00a0more like truffle mashed potatoes. I wish I had just ordered a bunch of these as my meal! The boneless spare ribs definitely surpassed my expectations, kind of like an upscale pulled pork. The calamari salad was what I was really looking forward to (I LOVE it at other stephen starr restaurants) but unfortunately it was a little diappointing. It was still good, just not as good as the one at continental in Philadelphia. I really wanted to like the tuna tartar spring rolls, but they were the disappointment of the night. They're really the only thing I wouldn't order again. \u00a0The lettuce cups and filet were both good too, but nothing you can't get elsewhere. Great for a date night or fun night out with the girls.

We ordered the kung pao monkfish(2 *) , crab sticky rice (2 *) and the silken tofu (1 *) with the vegetable fried rice with coconut curry foam (1 *) .. worst part was that the kitchen forgot about our ticket and we were served 45 minutes later which was frustrating to say the least ... the dessert (almond bread pudding) was the saving grace though ... I am really unsure how this place is so popular .. the food is meh ... service sucks .. the real test of character is how the service scales with the number of customers and unfortunately buddakan fell flat on that front .. the hype definitely did not live upto it's promise worse yet the restaurant staff did not even have the courtesy to make up for the delay in serving our food ... we left the place without paying any tip .. it was that disgusting an experience with the service offered to us ...", "Date": "2011-09-19", "Author_Location": "Toronto, Canada"}, {"Author": "Navid T.", "ReviewID": "V-hdDtedSeWbOGXO0ViNwg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "decent food, but not worth the price. if you want a light meal that is pricey, check this place out. its more for the ambiance and mood. good place to go before going out.", "Date": "2011-09-21", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Anthony P.", "ReviewID": "hFNu2fSACmVr7tAGg205-Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this place!!

We next had edamame dumplings that were very nice also had chili rock shrimp and they were very good as well. They cleared the table and reset for entrees. We ordered filet of beef which is prob one of the most conservative items on the menu(wifes choice i would never order that here). The filet of beef was done very nicely and was very good. I ordered the kung pao monkfish which was fantastic and i cant wait to have it again. We also ordered the minced pork lo mein. It had pickled cucumbers in it and we loved it. Cant wait to get that lo mein again too. For dessert we had the bread pudding thats comes with whisky ice cream it was very nice. We also had an espresso and a latte that were very good.

From the outside, you'd never notice it nor think its Buddakan. Its a very small black building with a tiny sign which reads 'Buddakan' and situated next to a large building (the building number is 202 so if you're going that helps a lot in locating it). Reservations are a must as any walk-ins after 6:30 are most likely going to have a wait time longer than 30 minutes. But trust me 30 minutes in Buddakan are a well spent 30 minutes. Upon arrival the staff greets you at the front desk. You are offered to wait in the lounge/bar area till you are seated. The bar has a different feel than the bar at Tao as its less noisy and has less of a club atmosphere and more of a lounge atmosphere. If you have a little bit of downtime be sure to look at the entire restaurant. There is the main dinning room which consists of immensely high ceilings and extravagant chandeliers, oh and I can't leave out the giant communal table which can seat up to 30 people. But that's not the only dinning room, there are two more. One is more quiet and good for going for a more casual dinner as you do have a bit more privacy than in the main dining room. Then next to it there is the library room which consists of a bar and lounge area and of course tables to eat at. The entire restaurant is gorgeous. My favorite room is the main dinning room and the library but each room has something to bring to this \"super restaurant\". But not only is the decor incredible, so is the food. Buddakan serves Pan-Asian cuisine which is everything from Beijing to Bangkok and more. The dishes are served family style (meaning which ever dish is ready first is served and not everything comes out at the same time) and your portions are based on your party size, so this is a perfect place if you're into ordering a mix of everything and sharing it. The food is phenomenal and definitely makes it worth the price, though price wise, its not as expensive as one may think. Its around $45 a person with an appetizer and entree (well that's not including drinks).

For those of you who are SATC fans, this is the restaurant where Carrie Bradshaw and Mr. Big had their glamorous wedding rehearsal dinner. After looking at the infinite number of items on the menu that looked appealing, we started with one of my all-time must-haves: the Deviled Tuna Tartare, with chili mayonnaise and scallions. While the pieces of tuna were very fresh, they lacked a bit of flavor. The ingredients were layered, not blended, taking away a bit from the potential of the dish. I enjoyed it, but it didn't stand out. We tried the Boneless Spare Ribs, which came with a bit of chinese mustard. Now we're talking. I really wouldn't have guessed this would be my prize winner, but it was. The ribs were tender and moist, and the glaze was delicious.

did we order this? none of the usual tirade on what the dish was, what the main ingredient was, etc. just plop and go. was it even that busy last night?and the food. meh. i've had better. the butternut squash dumplings looked good on the menu. it wasn't my favorite. it's way too creamy or gooey. has an odd consistency in your mouth. the dumplings were gooey already but they came served in a gooey sauce. so it was goo drenched in more goo. the char sui pork buns were tasty enough. i had better at momofuku. the scallion pancakes?

All in all, this spot seems to be one of the trendy restaurants with substance!", "Date": "2008-10-30", "Author_Location": "NY, NY"}, {"Author": "Tyler N.", "ReviewID": "l_-hRriTl2XNF4U4uhLzxA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "had great experiences here for 2 nights. it was a bit interesting that they sent u to this lounge area to wait for the hostess to come get u after u checked in. it took the hostess 5 mins or so to take us to the table. it was not a big deal but can be annoying. both nights i had a great time, food and service. the waiter really knows their stuff and recommended great dishes. both nights i had different appetizers, main course and dessert. for appetizer, the must try when u visit buddakan are lobster egg rolls, general tso's dumplings, and steamed sea bass roll. i've also tried scallion pancakes but it wasnt as good comparing to others. for main course, i had charred filet of beef, charred asparagus, wild mushroom chow fun, lobster fried rice and glazed alaskan black cod, which is a must try. for dessert i had honey jasmine cheesecake, which was very good. both nights i was there, they were busy but my reservations were at 7:30. i had a great experience at buddakan all around, the atmosphere, food and service. a great place for any occasions whether it's birthday, celebration, dinner meeting, romantic dinner. a really great place for out of towners to try. i'd definitely return on my next trip to nyc!!", "Date": "2011-01-19", "Author_Location": "Toluca Terrace, CA"}, {"Author": "Natasha B.", "ReviewID": "MUSHO5wklaJZOntnEMR9VQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had my birthday dinner at Buddakan back in February, and I am still reminiscing at how terrific and memorable the entire experience was. The decor in this place is unreal! So ornate and beautiful! Even better than the decor was the food. Oh em gee..literally mouth watering. The portions are rather small so you have to order quite a few samplings if you're starving. We had the rock shrimp and this crispy honey glazed shrimp..both to die for. Then we had lobster egg rolls and lobster rice along side some glazed lamb chomps. Everything came out steaming hot and in a beautiful presentation! I had an amazing cocktail that our friendly waiter suggested. I can't remember the exact name of the concoction but it had St. Germaine, champagne and splash of vodka. Delicious. They even brought out ice cream for the birthday girl (me!) It was truly one of the best dining experiences I have ever had!
