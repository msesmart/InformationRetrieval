It can't decide if it's a small dish (ie tapas style) type of place or if it's just a normal high end restaurant. The plates are very small, but they are priced as if they're normal entree sizes at one of the other River North Italian places. For instance, the raviolo is at most four bites of food but priced as if it's a full entree at like $16. Even the other pasta dishes are all quite small given prices ranging from $13-$20. But you'll need an appetizer or two or large dessert to substantiate RPM being a full dinner.The dishes are very good. I had the carbonara which was delicious. Great pancetta flavor throughout the dish and they break the egg yolk at the table which is what you'd expect at a higher end restaurant. It was delicious and one of the few pasta options that actually looked filling. I also tried the bucatini which was very good. I love pesto and it had a good pesto flavor, if anything it could've used even more pesto and basil.But the best part of the meal for me was, without doubt, the dessert. I had the tartufo which was absolutely sublime. Full of perfectly meshed flavors and great texture. Absolutely loved it and it may be enough on its own to convince me to return. The chocolate shell was great and the hazelnut gelato was great. Fantastic. I tried a couple other desserts on the menu other people had ordered, but the tartufo was the best. Worth the a bit of a hefty price tag.", "Date": "2014-07-16", "Author_Location": "Wilmette, IL"}, {"Author": "Jigna S.", "ReviewID": "SZf2r3ZYAmI1e4KD82PDfw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Very surprisingly disappointed with the food and service this time. First time we came here, we had a slightly quieter table so could carry on a conversation, the waiter was very friendly, and the food was delicious! We had ordered all vegetarian items then, which turned out very well. Last night, we got right near the bar so it was very rowdy, the waiter was nice but not seemed busy/not really present, and the food was the most disappointing aspect. This time, we ordered all non-vegetarian items...600 day prosciutto, meatballs, lobster caprese, lobster ravioli, carbonara, and eggplant parm (ok, 1 veggie item). The carbonara was probably the best item, everything else...while it was still good, it was certainly not great and not worth the small portion/high price on their menu. Imm so bummed about this...I really hyped up this place to my friends :/The main (and really only) saving grace, foodwise, was the one item not listed on the menu - the donuts!! Still as fluffy and airy and sweet as I remembered them! And the nutella and mascarpone on the side was heavenly!! I wish I could have licked it clean! :) Don't know what happened, RPM. Maybe just a bad night, or maybe the vegetarian items are their specialty?

The food is honestly awesome. I've gone twice now and everything I ate was unique and delicious. A MUST order is the truffled garlic bread. I've had a ton of Gaelic bread in my day, but this is hands-down the best. It's garlicky, cheesy, toasted to perfection, and it has. Kick of truffle to make it unlike any other garlic bread. The bucatini with marinara is a classic- if suggest getting it with the big meatball. The meatball is delicious- super soft and flavorful! The squid ink pasta with spicy king crab is a star... The spaghetti is fresh-made and it has a good amount of crab in the dish. The portion is small, but it's definitely an item I would recommend getting. It's spicy too! Goes well with a good red.I hear the desserts here are great to...

We had a fantastic waiter who made all sorts of recommendations to us from good wines to good appetizers. The appetizers were delicious, albeit VERY small. Not really much to share there. We ended up ordering five appetizers for a table of four people. We also ordered some pasta's - my favorite being the cavatelli. The cavatelli was actually my favorite part of the meal (and the pasta's were the best course we had). My recommendation would be to cut back on the appetizers and go hog wild on the pasta. As for the entree, I was pretty underwhelmed. The pasta set a very high standard but the entree was pretty average. It was good, just nothing to write home about (I had the filet mignon, my favorite cut of meat). Overall, the restaurant gets more than an average rating due to the service. Everyone is so kind and helpful. As I mentioned our waiter was great but above that we had good service at the bar. The host stand folks were really helpful too - we had to add on to your reservation the day of and it was a busy evening (night before a holiday). They were very accommodating and worked to get us all seated.Overall - great service, decent food, skip the appetizers and double up on the cavatelli.", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Brenda H.", "ReviewID": "N6mi5suML7h1tSHkpGzZ8Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Whatever you do, do not order the spaghetti and meatballs unless you'd like to relive those fond childhood memories of Chef Boyardee. I mean, I liked Chef Boyardee so I was able to eat the dish--no problem. It's just... I could have spent $1 on a can instead of the $17 here. My boyfriend thinks the meatball appetizer might have been better than the meatball in the spaghetti.. but what kind of trickery would that be?!

I was expecting incredible as I just simply love cured meats but it failed to deliver. \u00a0I was under impressed by this particular discuss and would suggest avoiding it. \u00a0Was drier than it should be and lacked much taste. \u00a0I would end up saying it was slightly waxy in the end. \u00a0Shredded Brussel sprout salad...now just so everyone is aware I absolutely hate these but my wife loves them. \u00a0She has made them at least a dozen different ways for me but to no avail I continue to hate them. \u00a0This salad...What? \u00a0I liked it. \u00a0So I would suggest it as it made me enjoy brussel sprouts. \u00a0The one and only time I would order something with them again. \u00a0So nicely done.Fritto Misto... \u00a0This sounded awesome as i love these types of dishes with lemon cut thin and fried into the dish. \u00a0Publican does an incredible one with belly on clams. \u00a0This I wanted to love but it ended up sub-par. \u00a0More of a tempura batter which I was not expecting. \u00a0I was hoping for a very very light breading almost sauteed but no such luck. \u00a0I think many folks would like this dish. \u00a0The shrimp were very good as they were cooked perfectly but reminded me of something I would end up with a sushi joint. \u00a0Just not what I was hoping for but I will say prepared well as these can sometimes be over cooked ruining the seafood.Meatball... \u00a0This takes the show. \u00a0A must order if you go to the restaurant. \u00a0My wife and I are meatball junkies. \u00a0Eat them in every Italian neighborhood we visit from city to city. \u00a0Ordered them like crazy the 2 trips to Italy. \u00a0Best meatball to date was served to us in Boston's North End at Nico's. \u00a0So whenever we go to Boston we end up at Nico's. \u00a0This meatball... dare I say this... beat it. \u00a0Best meatball I have had. \u00a0They were small so I was half expecting them to be dry but they end up moist and so light. \u00a0My wife makes pretty darn good meatballs but this place blows them out. \u00a0Not sure how they do it as we do milk and bread and have tried other methods to keep them moist and light but these were ridiculous. \u00a0If I am walking by randomly I believe I would stop in to have a plate of meatballs. \u00a0Love to know the recipe.Finished with the Pansotti which was very good. \u00a0Who doesn't like cream based dishes?So overall food was a solid 3 due to varying levels of execution with the meatballs being a 6. \u00a0Staff was great. \u00a0Wine and cocktails were very good. \u00a0Atmosphere was very nice.", "Date": "2014-06-23", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Justin O.", "ReviewID": "lZj_C7UUg0JvJc4R01099w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent atmosphere and definitely a place to have a tastey meal in a hip environment! \u00a0Whether you choose to dine in the dinning area or have your meal in the bar area, you can't go wrong. Up beat music plays in the background while great conversations are happening abound. Now down to the food and drinks... :) plenty of food choices with portion sizes to fill the tummy but not to a glutinous point. I started with a shredded Brussels sprouts/avocado salad, followed by a potato gnocchi in a sausage taping chili flake sauce. The palette was pleased! \u00a0I finished the meal off with the must have chocolate hazelnut dessert ball. Mmm mmm. Definitely save room for this treat! \u00a0The salad had an enjoyable spice to compliment the flavors of the salad, making the brussel sprouts a pleasure to eat. The gnocchi was very soft and delicately made. \u00a0The sauce was more of a Marsala style, so if you want a res sauce base, you need to ask for the \"Sunday gravy\" aka the red sauce. And now on to the dessert... Tartufo aka chocolate hazelnut ball. One phrase: \u00a0\" omg amazing!\" \u00a0A must order for chocolate lovers. The Arista Sonoma pino noir had great character to compliment the rest of the meal.

The first time I went, I was pleasantly surprised and thought the food was well done. Unfortunately, my excitement for this upscale, small-plate, Italian restaurant blinded me from reality; It's just a restaurant to see and be seen. If you enjoy this sort of restaurant, than RPM is the place for you. Unfortunately, for me, that's not why I go to restaurants. I go for the food. I took my dad the second time around. He is Italian, through and through. I thought this would be a great place to take him since he enjoys fine dining and Italian food. It started to get ugly as soon as we walked in. \u00a0We were placed in the very back of the restaurant near the door where waitstaff were constantly traversing in and out of the kitchen. When my father asked if there was another table available (we saw about five empty tables), the ma\u00eetre d informed us that since we weren't frequent customers we did not have priority to sit at one of the other tables. (Rude, are we? Are we in a club??? Um no. ) \u00a0When my father told them that we would wait for another table or leave, the ma\u00eetre d magically brought us to a table away from the traffic.

It was crispy and light and I'll be honest, I ate almost the entire plate myself. \u00a0The Caprese was also delicious, but sorry, it just didn't stand up to the garlic bread.For entrees we got the Smoked Eggplant Stuffed Pasta & the Short Rib Pansotti.

The prosciutto hit the spot, then it was followed by Truffled Garlic Bread (yum!), a wood oven pizzettes (yum yum), and Wood Roasted Octopus with chickpeas and celery (yum yum yum).Then, we ordered several pasta dishes: Raviolo with sweet corn, Spicy King Crab with squid ink spaghetti, Sweet Pea Risotto, and Pappardelle Bolognese. The Spicy king crab was so good we ordered a second plate. My favorite was the pappardelle. It was just delicious. Lastly, we ordered a whole grilled Branzino. It was fresh, delicate, cooked nicely, but I was still in love with the pappardelle.For desserts, Bill's chocolate Budino with salted caramel and cocoa nibs was very decadent. That was a proper dessert. We also ordered Affogato made with this special coffee that was made somehow using a high pressure method and then bottled. The result was you get a coffee that's crisp and strong. It was very very strong but tasted awesome with some gelato floats.Hope Dawson and Casey enjoy their dinner at RPM as much as we did.", "Date": "2014-04-27", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Shan D.", "ReviewID": "wMxxb0E5tw_60RzZe2Yi-Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great food that almost never disappoints.

Yes, I got over the looks of the squid ink noodles and enjoyed the dish and the overall experience. A lot of crab flavor and it wasn't very spicy. Drinks? Not all that impressed.

However, I was ready to expect good food, small portions, and big prices. It helps when you know that before walking in.Main overview of my review: RPM is a good place to go to once, check off your bucket list, and be done with it. The food is certainly good, and the experience itself is fine, but I likely will not return. There are other Italian restaurants in the city that don't charge you an arm and a leg for good food - go to those places before fighting for a reservation here. This is a place to visit if you're a fan of the TV show and looking for something touristy to do in Chicago. Appetizers:Ricotta cheese with toast: The cheese was a little bland for my taste, but that's also the nature of ricotta cheese. It was certainly fresh! I enjoyed that it came with some marinara sauce to supplement the flavor.Grilled Octopus: Tasted like it was flavored with bacon, but it wasn't. Very good!Pastas: Spicy King Crab: came with squid ink spaghetti (for those unfamiliar, the noodles are black). Had a great kick to it, and I'm not usually very good with eating spicy food. The crab was delicious, but I was worried with portioning enough of it out to my friends dining with us. Such a small portion! Still enjoyable.Prosciutto Tortellini: Very salty, but the boys enjoyed it. I think it helped that it packed a pretty big and unexpected flavor, especially since it looks so white and bland on the plate. Entrees:Swordfish: Wouldn't likely order again. Tangy, the red pepper paste was interesting, and it was flaky. Isn't swordfish supposed to be more meaty than flaky...?Porterhouse steak to share: We ordered this so that it was enough for 2, since we'd heard about how big this is. It was delicious, cooked medium rare. Definitely get it MR, as recommended. Desserts: Chocolate ice cream ball with something inside it: Very chocolatey, liked the texture. Good enough for chocolate fans.Some doughnut special with Nutella and marscapone sides: LOVED it. This was the highlight of my meal and I was so happy that not many in our party wanted to share this with me. So great.Our reservation was at 5 PM on a Friday, and we arrived 15 minutes late. They were very accommodating and nice to tell us it was no problem - especially since Clark is extremely time oriented! Our waiter gave great recommendations, and I tried some cocktail that was no longer on the menu (bourbon, orange, amaretto, and egg white for texture. Surprisingly good!) Tim was his name.

I explained that our bellhop made the reservation for us and maybe there was confusion, but that I was pregnant and is there anything he could do? He explained that he would do what he could, but that we could go to the bar where there was open seating. We looked over at the bar and it was wall-to-wall people standing. We went over and tried the hover method to grab a table when others would leave, but the patrons were pretty rude over there. I went and stood near the front door near the bouncer and he was fairly unfriendly as well. The time while we waited for a table was so unpleasant. Perhaps the restaurant should not encourage everyone to crowd in the bar fighting over tables.

From there, we moved to the caesar salad with no anchovies (Tim suggested since we were sharing we have them chop and toss it for us, great suggestion!), followed by the prosciutto tortelloni, pork chop, gorgonzola mashed potatoes and a dessert chosen by Tim. He chose the special which was almost a donut hole type dessert served with nutella and some sort of whipped sweet ricotta.It is rare that everything you order and eat is amazing, but EVERYTHING was amazing. We started with a glass of Prosecco, followed by another glass of white and then we switched to red.

When I think Italian food, I think romantic low lit rooms with Sinatra or Dean Martin playing softly in the background as I sip on some nice Chianti. What you get when you walk into RPM is a feeling of being at Perry's tent at Lollapalooza. Seriously, is the \"modern\" aspect of this restaurant the fact that they pretty much blast electronic dance music the entire time?!?!? Or is it the seemingly odd white suit jackets worn by the servers, accompanied by the stealth ear pieces they are wearing?

It's just way too over the top for a simpleton like myself.As for the food, it was just ok. 3 stars at best, a bit pricey in terms of portion sizes. I would definitely recommend coming here with a group, as they have a lot of appetizers, small plates and salads that are great for sharing. There were 4 of us so we definitely got to try a lot of items. For starters, we went with the white figs, crispy ravioli, meatballs, truffled garlic bread and the shredded brussels sprout salad. I thought the figs were tasty, but the ravioli's were about the size of Chicklets. Again, some may call this modern, I see as flushing 6 bucks down the toilet. They weren't really even that good. As for the meatballs, I think my mom's are just as good, if not better. The sauce was nice and fresh, but nothing about the flavors or textures stood out. The winner to me was the brussel sprout salad. I liked the shredded sprouts and it paired well with the avocado.For entrees I had the seafood risotto and split it with my buddy who had the filet. The risotto was good, but the filet was even better as it had a great char on the outside and was a perfect med rare. My wife had the Ravioli a la RPM which I thought was delicious.We all shared the Tartufo for dessert which was ok, but I'm not too much of a sweets guy anyways so, yeah.Eric was our server and I have to say he was terrific.

Both times, we received wonderful service and the food was always phenomenal! The only thing that is against my taste is the dim lighting, but I can deal with it. It's modern and chic, but the food is delicious and tastes very home made. Some of my favorites were the Squid ink spicy crab pasta. i honestly can't stop thinking about this dish. It's perfection ALL AROUND. The crab is tender and tastes sweet and fresh. The spicy sauce is creamy and delicious and it all blends really well together. The lobster caprese is delicious. My fiance is also obsessed! He loves that it comes with big chunks of lobster meat.. They definitely aren't greedy at RPM. I also love their bread with the ricotta cheese. I also dream about this magnificent concoction on a weekly basis! The ricotta cheese is fresh and creamy and flavorful and the bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.. You spread the ricotta on the bread, top it with a little tomato sauce..... Please excuse me while I wipe the drool from my chin!Mama DePandi's bucatini is delicious too. We ordered a side of meatballs (some of the best meatballs I've ever had in my life). As delicious as it really is, the Squid ink pasta is #1 in my heart. But the bucatini isn't far behind. I've also had their ADORABLE little pepperoni pizza. It's good.. there's no such thing as bad pizza... And considering how tiny and adorable it was, I loved it even more! lol Keep in mind, the pizzas are tiny, so if that's all you want, I recommend ordering just that, as they aren't big enough to share unless you're ordering a bunch of stuff from the menu and sharing it \"family style\", which is what we did.As far as drinks, the only cocktail I've tried is the Americano Cobbler. it was yummy and fruity, just how I like it. i wish it were a little bigger, but whatever, that's my problem. It's amazingly delicious. I also had their Pinot Grigio - Ca' Donini, Veneto. For being just $8 a glass, it was honestly one of the best glasses of Pinot I've ever had. I'm no wine expert and I seldom drink wine, so don't quote me on that.. But I really liked it. Very smooth. DESSERTS! I've tried the tarfufo which was very yummy.. But since it was just me and my fiance, this giant ball of delicious chocolate gelato and hazlenut shell became a little redundant after about 4 spoonfuls. I recommend it if you're sharing it with 2 or 3 other people. But it was delicious.. It was just too much for the 2 of us after we had just stuffed our faces will all of the prior courses.We also had these little beignet-donut thingies that came with a side of lemon curd and mascarpone for dipping. My fiance LOVED the mascarpone.. I thought they were delicious all on their own. I almost called off our engagement when he took my last piece and swallowed it whole when I wasn't looking. I've since then forgiven him, but it still left a hole in my heart. I'm sure that last piece was the best piece.. But I'll never know. Oddly enough, I can't seem to find these beignet-donutty things on the menu, so I don't know if it was just a special for the night or something you have to request. I''ll ask about them next time I go.. You can bet on it!So yea, everything was awesome! I love this place and i love the service and I ESPECIALLY love the food. Everything tastes home made and fresh. i HIGHLY recommend. If you're going, please add me to your reservation. I'll just sit there quietly and eat my meal.. I'll even pay for my own food. I promise.

Sadly I found out \"B\" was the correct choice. I understand that you are going to get small portions at an\" Italian tapas\" place, but don't charge me $17 for a place of gnocchi that was given at a portion the size of a baseball. I could have spent the same at Rosebud and had enough for leftovers. RPM would have saved face if the gnocchi was good, but the sauce had a taste of a Campbell soup. The only dish the actually had flavor was the Cavatelli pasta, but it's not worth waiting 3 weeks to try it.

Left fairly disappointed and unsatisfied. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The decor is very loung-y and the patrons all have an LA/Miami vibe. Now, onto the food. I love all things truffle and almost always order anything with it on the menu so of course when I saw that RPM had garlic bread with truffles, I couldn't contain my excitement. However, that was probably one of the most disappointing dish of the night. The garlic bread was kind of dry, the truffle felt out of place, and it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Also ordered the meatballs which were decent. The carbonara was also decent and they mix it with the raw egg right in front of you so it's pretty cool. Overall, the food was just meh for me. Decent, but certainly not top notch. There are so many other italian restaurants in the city that have much better dishes that I don't think I will be coming back for the food.

I'm a foodie and don't usually have problems with service unless it's absolutely terrible. I can even enjoy small ethnic restaurants with \"seemingly\" cold, non-english-speaking servers. As long as my food is served in a timely manner at the right temperature, I'm happy. I was at RPM at 4pm on a Saturday. The place was nearly empty but the hostesses were too busy to seat us right away, even with a reservation. After a wait, we were assigned a very knowledgeable waitress. However, she had a bit too much to say, and my dining partner (a very good friend from overseas with whom I reunited after 3 years) and I were often interrupted, and had to spend those lengthy interruptions NOT eating, and definitely NOT catching up. In terms of FOOD- I loved the antipasti's portions- not too big, not too small. In terms of taste and texture, no single dish was overpowering or over/undercooked. They were OK, nothing special, just satisfactory. My friend and i shared all the plates--shredded brussels sprouts salad, provolone-stuffed peppers, stuffed squash blossoms, an order of their truffled garlic bread, and the maine lobster ravioli as our entree. One major discontent I felt about the dishes was the ravioli, although the sauce was fine and the pasta was seemingly al dente, its filling was COLD. I let our server know and suggested she acknowledge the kitchen staff. Against our willingness to continue with the remaining ravioli, she grabbed our plate and insisted she'd get it heated up.

She watches the Rancic's program on TV and has also had an internship with Lettuce Entertain You. For those reasons, she has been begging me to try RPM.The 3 of us had reservations for 4:30pm on a Friday, since anything after that was booked until 10pm. Plan way ahead of time, this place gets crowded!AMB:The d\u00e9cor of the place is very modern, dimly lit, and classy. Themes of black and white dominated everything from the tables to the servers uniforms. Most of the people inside were pretty well dressed, looked important, and a bit on the hip/younger side, for what that's worth.Let me begin by saying this is definitely \"modern\" Italian. Do NOT expect chicken 'parm the size of Nonno's 45 vinyls, but rather an almost tapa-style menu with a variety of flavors. Regardless, Spaghetti and the classic aforementioned chicken 'parm, had a quiet little corner on the menu, for the hardcore traditionalists. PER INZIARE:We began with the Ricotta & Seminola toast, which was great! A Combination of fresh ricotta and unique marinara was a great way to start off a \"brava sera.\" Although next time, I would like to try the Truffled garlic bread, since every review here seems to recommend it! As a cheese fanatic, I felt compelled to make my other family members indulge in the plate of four imported cheeses. This was probably the only thing we should NOT have gotten. The cheeses and jams were all interesting, but wasn't exactly $16 interesting, especially for the portion. We could have gotten some of the probably more interesting cold antipasti. But alas, the only one that stuck out was the gorgonzola, the other 2 both resembled a brie, and the pecorino wasn't as good as some of the imported parmesans I've had. \u00a0Lastly, we ordered the pepperoni \"pizzette\" which despite its small size, had big flavors. I wasn't quite aware pizza could be THAT classy.PORTATA PRINCIPALE:We all ordered something different and tried each others' dishes. Both cousins had a slow-roasted dish and I opted for the Short Rib Pansotti. The Herb-Roasted Chicken was decent, but like many Italian chicken dishes, was a little bland in my opinion. On the contrary though, the Sicilian Pork Arrosti with Kale and Polenta was remarkably good. The meat was savory and had a smoky flavor to it. Couple that with some old-school creamy polenta, and in my opinion, tastier-than-spinach Kale, it was impressive! I opted for the heavier-in-consistency but smaller-in-portion Short Rib Pansotti. This was definitely awesome. With an interesting Tellagio cream sauce and delicious short rib filled Pansotti, this is was the cat's pajamas of pasta and meat. We had also decided to split a side of the garlic-whipped potatoes, which were seasoned perfectly and topped with some of the bite-y 'gorg from earlier. Drinks!Cocktails all around for our crew, we aren't necessarily wino's and didn't want to dive into the olympic swimming pool of a wine list, split a bottle of something pricey, ask about pairings, etc. Traditionally, the Elmwood Manhattan was pretty strong and conventional. The Americano Cobbler appeared girly and tasted cheery. Lastly, the Pomegranate Gimlet was, by unanimous decision, the most flavorful and well-concocted of the 3 beverages. Unfortunately though, none of these really wowed me at the $11 price level.Service:Really great! Not overly attentive, and I never felt neglected in any way. Our server gave detailed responses to our questions and was very polite in every possible way. My only constructive and by no means authoritative criticism would be for her to raise her voice, especially when it gets crowded in there! Summary:RPM is awesome, I would say there are some hidden gems for the true Italian food connoisseur to try there. The atmosphere is hip and trendy, inside modern, service top notch, drink list extensive and most importantly the food was fantastic. My only qualms would be some of the portion sizes vs cost, and that probably by luck I wasn't overly impressed with any of the cocktails.

Shortly after, the crispy ravioli arrived. They were tiny, but packed with flavor - cheese, spinach and some kind of citrus; different but very good. Then came the meatballs - they rivaled my mom's - SO GOOD! Curtis recommended that if we were planning on having a pasta dish as our main course that we start with a salad. We split Giuliana's Italian salad and soon after our pasta arrived - I got Carbonara and my boyfriend got Gnocchi. Although the portion was small, it was packed with flavor and richness and after our starters and salads, it was more than enough.

So we had lots to be happy about.We started off with the truffled garlic bread - I enjoyed it, but it didn't seem to have very much truffle flavor to it - also, there was a lot of parsley on it, which seemed to be the theme of the night, because I felt that almost everything had excess parsley - which I dislike. Regardless, the bread was still yummy, and you bet your ass we finished the entire thing.Next up was some fried olives for the pregnant chick, which I did not try because I'm not a fan of olives, but she said they were great. Then we shared some fried polenta, which was the pit of our meal - bland, tasteless, and again, overloaded with parsley. I myself have only made polenta a couple of times, and mine has more flavor than RPM's. We both had a couple of bites and decided not to waste our calories on it.After that, we shared the arancini - words cannot explain how amazing this is! I've had arancini from several different restaurants, and this blows them all away. The flavor and texture were so unique, and even though it's a fried rice ball, it wasn't heavy or too filling. The only thing we didn't like was that the order only came with one arancini, and we had to share it! Time for pasta! We debated a while on which to get, but we finally settled on Mama DePandi's bucatini pomodoro, which we added the prime beef meatballs to, and the prosciutto tortelloni. My personal favorite was the basic bucatini - you can tell that the pasta was super fresh, and was cooked perfectly. The sauce was fantastic and not too heavy - when paired with the meatballs, it was just absolute italian perfection! By far, the best version of \u00a0\"spaghetti and meatballs\" I've ever had at a restaurant. The tortellini was great, it was stuffed with prosciutto and mascarpone cheese and in a nice, somewhat creamy, butter rosemary sauce. It was almost too much flavor packed in one tiny dish, but still enjoyable. I went back for seconds with the bucatini and let my friend finish the tortellini.Now the best part: dessert. You MUST get the chocolate budino. I've never had anything like it. I almost can't even explain it, really all there is to say is that it's salty, caramel-ey, chocolatey goodness - and despite it's richness, it's hard to put the spoon down. I can't wait to come back and try more items!

Giuliana and Bill. I've been wanting to go to RPM for a good long while, so you can imagine how excited I was when it was my birthday dinner destination (with my four best friends by my side.) It was actually a last-minute decision, so we had to go without reservations, which clearly wasn't ideal. Definitely don't ever plan on doing that here. We had it in our minds that we could have drinks at the bar and snag a bar table because you can still order there. Let me tell you, this was not an easy task. That's why I learned to love Landon.Landon's the \"door guy\" who's way more than a door guy. When this place gets packed, he turns into the master of sorting out who deserves/earns a bar table. We were drinking bellinis at the bar and he came out of nowhere, asking us if we wanted a bar table. Well, yes, yes, YES we do, we told him... and a few minutes later, he literally guarded an empty table until we could make our way over to it. I think he just watches to see who has been waiting, and starts delegating who gets to sit. Luckily, it worked in our favor!I can't say enough about the service. It was certainly top-notch. Our drinks were always full, and the food came out quickly. Ohhhh, the food. Here's what I loved:-Truffle garlic bread, no explanation needed. -Fried olives stuffed with sausage and mozzarella-Zucchini fritti-Spaghetti and meatball (one GIANT meatball)-Herb risotto This was one of the best Italian meals I've had in a long time, and I loved enjoying such amazing food in such a beautiful atmosphere.

(5/5) \u00a0Sarah got the Pomegranate Gimlet, which also was pretty light and had a good flavor. \u00a0I preferred my drink to hers, but both were good. (4/5). \u00a0After Brittany explained the menu, we decided to do a few of the small bites first. \u00a0We started with he Prime Beef Meatballs, and the Truffled Garlic Bread. \u00a0First, the meatballs, they were quite large, very fragrant, and smothered in a homemade marinara like sauce. \u00a0They were so delicious by themselves, but then you introduce the Truffled Garlic Bread, and your senses approached an overload of awesome. \u00a0They went together like peas and carrots! \u00a0The portions felt much larger than a traditional Tapas kind of menu, so we were ready to jump into our main entrees after finishing these items.Sarah choose the Spicy King Crab - Squid Ink Spaghetti. (4/5) \u00a0Brittany recommended asking for extra sauce to kick the flavor up a bit, so we rolled with it. \u00a0Even with the extra sauce, we didn't feel like it was Spicy at all. \u00a0It had a good flavor, just not as a strong of a flavor as we were expecting. \u00a0Still very good, but needed a bit more of a kick I think to be called spicy.I went with the 8 oz. All-Natural Filet Mignon (5/5) along with the Garlic Whipped Potatoes (3.5/5). \u00a0The filet was one of the best that I have ever had anywhere. \u00a0It was nice and thick and wonderful. \u00a0When it first came out it looked to be overdone, due to the crazy amount of searing on the outside. \u00a0It turns out that it was in fact cooked perfectly to a medium rare on the inside, and the outside was seared so well, due to their wood firing technique. \u00a0It was melt in your mouth good. \u00a0LOVED IT! \u00a0The potatoes, for me weren't anything special. \u00a0For 8 dollars, I was expecting these potatoes to knock my socks off, but sadly they stayed in place. \u00a0They weren't bad by any means, but they weren't overly flavorful or unique.For dessert, we were brought a tiny flight of Gelato's and Sorbetto's for our anniversary. \u00a0It came with Limoncello, Chocolate, Coconut, and Coffee. (5/5) All were very flavorful and great. \u00a0I only wish they were more than tiny cones and scoops. \u00a0If I had enough room and I wasn't so cold from being in Chicago in the winter I would have ordered bigger amounts. \u00a0The last part of the meal, was the dessert special (Bomboloni) (5/5) which Brittany also recommended. \u00a0They were these small square pastries, that were so light and fluffy that you could barely hold them without crushing them from your grip. \u00a0They were rolled in cinnamon and sugar I believe, and had a Nutella and a whipped cheese dipping spread. \u00a0I was unsure about these, but they were so heavenly. \u00a0After sitting for a while to digest and make enough room to finish our wine, it was time for our check. \u00a0I didn't really look at any prices, I just wanted to have a good experience, so naturally I was a bit nervous. \u00a0It came, and I was pleasantly surprised. \u00a0It was about 38 dollars under what I had budgeted for the meal. \u00a0Since Brittany was such an amazing server I went ahead and left her about a 40% tip. \u00a0I figured I had budgeted a lot more so why not give it to someone who is the master of her craft.The bottom line here, is this place lives up to the hype for sure. \u00a0You need to run, not walk to this place and have a great experience. \u00a0Just make sure you do yourself the favor of asking for Brittany when you make the reservation!", "Date": "2014-01-22", "Author_Location": "St Charles, MO"}, {"Author": "Sujata M.", "ReviewID": "A6429yCA0r0EDe4xx-dL6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wonderful restaurant!!

(yup, I have a not-so-secret love for ridic reality tv shows). So when I planned a trip to Chicago this summer, I knew I had to make it there.Believe me, before I went, I looked over the menu a bunch of times, read tons of yelp reviews, and drooled at all the pics on yelp. So, needless to say, I had pretty high expectations of this place. I went with two friends, and these high expectations were met and were even surpassed. As crazy as it sounds, I think I could easily call RPM my favorite restaurant ever. And, shocker, I'm not even too into Italian food. So you know this had to be good. First of all, the atmosphere was pretty cool. Very modern, clean, and classy. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from G&B. Be prepared for loud music, though. But it does make you want to dance! (I saw a few people dancing in their seats that night). And for anyone with a shameful love for boy bands: don't worry, they even played One Direction while we were there. Our waiter was amazing. Super friendly and very helpful with giving recommendations and answering any questions that we had. He even sent us out some of the mini ice cream cones \u00a0, which was super sweet!For appetizers, we got both the zucchini fritti, the stuffed squash blossoms, and the meatballs. They were both SO good. We got the zucchini after it was recommended by the waiter, and it was just as good as he described. They were tempura fried but still pretty light. And the squash blossoms - amazing! Seriously, get both. We also got the meatballs after seeing all the rave reviews on here. The tomato sauce was perfect - chunky, but not too chunky, and very well-seasoned. And the meatballs - yum! For our main course, we got the agnolotti pasta with shaved truffles on top. Seriously, they bring out a bowl of truffles, and shave them on top of the pasta right in front of you. The dish was really good, and I can assure you, that there was nothing left on that plate once we were done - we downed the pasta, sauce, and truffles. For dessert we split the tarfuto, the gelato with rice pudding, and the mini ice cream cones mentioned above. Definitely get the tartufo if you like nutella or ferrero rocher chocolates; it's legit a giant, ice cream version of a ferrero rocher. You'll wish you had more than one even if you are stuffed. The gelato was also good, and I'm not even a big rice pudding person.I also got the Piccolo Rosa drink. Amazing.Easily the best meal I've had yet. Loved it and can't wait to go back!

We got a round of appetizers, of which I thought the lobster caprese was clearly the best. The beef carpaccio was nice, although the beef was a little bit on the dry side and along with the dried mushrooms really dried out the palate. I was just as torn by the main courses. We got several different pastas and two entrees. The Pasta Carbonara was spot on, one of the best dishes of the night. The signature RPM Ravioli were pretty good, but the Spicy Squid Ink Pasta with Crab was pretty bland and needed quite a bit of salt, not much crab either. The entrees were a little bit of a let down, especially the swordfish which I was really looking forward to (as well as the most expensive item ordered). The fish was overcooked and dry, and the plating was pretty bad, just a hunk of fish on large plate with a spoonful of tapenade off to the side. Not worth the money. The roasted chicken was much better. The chicken itself was very tender, juicy and flavorful and the roasted Hen of the Woods mushrooms were insanely good. The polenta was delicious as were the roasted potatoes, only there were only a few bites of each that I was left wanting much more. The desert was delicious- flaky, fried pastries with two very delicious dipping sauces. Although there were several great dishes there were just as many that left something to be desired. The atmosphere was very fun and trendy. I enjoyed my meal here but I would be wary of going back, or at least I would steer clear of a couple of dishes.

I don't know how RPM makes their pesto, but it is absolutely delicious and the lobster was fresh and just melts in your mouth.All of the plates at RPM are small plates, but don't let this fool you! The food is so rich that you will be shocked that you are so full during your entree course and may have to take home leftovers! (Side note: The pasta is just as good leftover! ) I enjoyed the prosciutto wrapped scallops which were so good that I think I tried to cut my last scallop into about 8 pieces to continue enjoying the flavor. I pulled the prosciutto off and didn't eat it, but it gave the 3 large scallops the perfect accent flavor! I could have done without the weird lima beans on top, however those were easy to avoid. Dessert is a MUST! We ordered the tartufo and Bills Chocolate Budino. The tartufo is a creamy hazelnut ice cream, that is reminiscent of Nutella, coated in a crispy chocolate shell. The Budino is literally a bowl filled with a carmel with a pudding like consistency, topped with salt and chocolate chips. IT IS SO GOOD! So rich that after 3 spoonfuls your tastebuds are on overload but you keep going back for more. They also give you these cute, classy dessert spoons that are extra long which make reaching across the table for more bites even easier!I also ordered the Friulano white wine, which I had never heard of before. When I asked the waitress she said the flavor was like a, \"Crisp mountain stream.\" I had to hold back laughter at her description, but ordered it and loved it!

The small plates that were really good were the mushroom pizza and the lemon ricotta spread. I got the branzino for two the second time I was there as my larger entree.

My parents drove all the way from the suburbs which is sometimes a challenge to get them to do, but when I told them we were taking them to RPM, they were game!What we ordered:Truffle garlic bread.

It's too bad that morel mushrooms are only in season for a short time, the pasta was good. Morels didn't taste like mushrooms, very meaty and the pasta it was served with came with a light sauce. If they have this available, I highly suggest getting it! We loved it so much, we ordered 2!Roasted chicken. This was a first for us. The roasted chicken was tender, juicy and had a lot of flavor to it.Prawns. So good! I wish there were more than 4 pieces on the plate. Pomodoro + meatballs. I do not like meatballs, but the meatballs here are so good! They aren't dry, they aren't huge, good size and goes well with the pomodoro.Lobster ravioli, one of my favorites here along with the risotto, but they took the risotto that I loved off the menu.

I was shocked when I saw the prices on the menu (in a good way!). Small plates for $5-6, pasta entree's for $12-19 and of course, higher end steaks and fish, if that strikes your fancy. My friend and I split a couple of plates, below is what we had with reviews in tow:Provolone Stuff Peppers: Meh. Nothing to write home about. The kick from the pepper paired with the cheese was an interesting mediley. Very light and fresh, but feel free to skip it unless you are a pepper-lover. Prosciutto Wrapped Figs: In the word of Mrs. Rancic herself AMAZEBALLS. Holy, moly these things were SO good. You must order them! There were five or six on the plate and both my friend and I wished there were five more once we polished the plate off. Note - this next dish was created by yours truly so if you want to try this great mix-up you'll have to ask specifically for it. I ordered the truffled garlic bread because I'd heard great things from other reviews, however, I couldn't not try their \"home made riccotta\" so I ordered the bread w/ a side of ricotta. DE-LICIOUS. I am a ricotta lover, I grew up on fresh ricotta from local farms in Italy. While the RPM ricotta doesn't really compare to the stuff in Italia it did hit the spot. Highly recommend this mash-up if you're looking to try the yummy bread & ricotta. Be sure to credit me though... jk. Pasta Dish 1 - Short Rib Pappardelle. It was good, not great, but good. The amount of short rib in the dish was a little disappointing but the dish was good. I recommend it if you're looking for a classic italian dish w/ a twist. Pasta Dish 2 - Prosciutto Tortelloni. It was good.. keep in mind there are only 5 tortelloni in the dish so if you're looking to share you'll only get a small piece of the actual dish.

Perfect summer cocktail as I settled into my weekend vacay = the peach Bellini. We needed a snack to tide us over so we snatched up the bartender who was keeping busy behind the bar refilling the freshly cut fruit and mixers before the dinner rush.

I couldn't get over the thought that I was eating my cat's food. The crispy crustini was piled high. The texture threw me, but that's my own issue, not necessarily that the dish was lacking. At least I can say I tried it.-Arancini - amazing! Like fried balls of carby, cheesy heaven. Although I would have loved a smidge more sauce for dipping.-Gnocchi al Forno - also a perfect small bite to share and the pairing of sage and Gorgonzola needs to be replicated in my own kitchen since I don't have the luxury of flying to Chicago whenever I crave these flavors.All in all it was a great happy hour local and I recommend it if you're in the neighborhood.

Everything on the menu sounds (and probably is) incredible. Because we wanted to same a little of this and that, we ordered the imported burrata, prime beef meatballs, shredded brussels sprout salad, Maine lobster ravioli and the morel mushroom pasta. Everything was amazing, but prime beef meatballs and morel mushroom pasta were the standouts. Hyperbole warning: The morel mushroom may be the best pasta I've ever put in my mouth (and I've been to Italy). Even with a bottle of red wine and dessert, the final bill was actually much more affordable than we'd expected.

I have to give a huge shout out to the staff, they are fantastic! When I cut into my fish it was completely raw. The waitress came over took it immediately and brought me a whole new piece of fish. They also didn't charge us for the fish and gave us a complimentary dessert. I didn't even complain! I was in such a great mood, my husband and I have not had a date night in a while so nothing was getting me down. How they handled the situation was fantastic and exactly how it should be handled.When I go to RPM I always want one of everything on the menu and that is because this place does not disappoint. I love the small plates they have at the start of the menu. They are perfect for sharing. We started with the Smoked Salmon Crostini, Lobster Caprese and the Truffled Garlic Bread. The salmon and Caprese salad where perfect for 2 people sharing. The Truffled bread was a little larger so that lasted us the whole meal which was perfect. We then split a pasta, the Potato Gnocchi. This is one of my favorite meals. I am a huge Gnocchi fan. This is perfect for sharing or for an entree on it's own. What I really like about RPM is their portions aren't huge. They are just the perfect size. After the pasta I had the Wiled Striped Bass which, after it was cooked, was really good! I am not a huge fish fan, I usually eat more red meat, but I wanted to try something different. There wasn't a piece left on my plate. My husband had the Scallops which were good too. All the entrees are ala carte so we did not order a side dish, it would have been too much for us. For dessert we had the donuts which were a special item. I highly recommend them if you still have room by this time! They are freshly made and melt in your mouth. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that say they pack you in and you are close to the table next to you. For some reason though this doesn't bother me. We were just so focused on what we were doing that we didn't even notice who was sitting next to us. Plus it is kind of loud so I didn't even hear what the other tables were talking about.

Initially I was expecting to be disappointed. Horrible I know but it's the truth. I figured it would just be another trendy restaurant where the who's who hangs out and makes a big deal out of it but that the food would be sub par or average at best. I was very wary about a trendy Italian spot in the River North area. The moment I walked in I was pleased. I just loved the atmosphere and decor. The bar area is wide open and welcoming and the dining room is very posh and chic. My friend and I were lead to our table and seated next to a couple of guys dining out which was nice because we ended up making chit chat and sharing our opinions of cocktails and food we each ordered and ended up mutually upselling for the waiter. What first impressed me beyond the interior was the service. It was top-notch and I can easily say that it was some of the best dining service I have ever experienced. Not only was our server incredibly personable and on point all night but even the food runner, water guy, manager.... everyone was just great and so on top of their game. I've never seen such great team work. Every employee was working and helping one another.And I must say I truly enjoyed the food. We had:One of the Pizettes which my friend and I both loved. It was tasty and cooked just right. The crust was perfectly crispy. It's small but for a little started it's fine (comes with 4 small pieces). Polenta w/ Truffle & Poached Egg - I believe anything with truffle is tasty and this was definitely tasty. Not my favorite dish but enjoyable.Gnocchi w/ Gorgonzola & Sage - This was so delicious. \u00a0I love gnocchi and this was by far the largest pieces of gnocchi I've seen. The gorgonzola and sage were great compliments to one another.Pesto Pasta - This was good but not great. I enjoyed but definitely not the best pesto I've had. My friend really enjoyed it though.Pasta Carbonera - This isn't really my kind of dish but my friend really wanted it and we were sharing everything. Again I thought it was good but not great. My friend really liked it.Eggplant Parmesan - This was probably my favorite dish. It was so delicious and tasty. And I thought it was a perfect portion. I would come back and order just this and maybe a cocktail and appetizer and be happy.Parmesan Potatoes - We ordered these thanks to our new dining buddies next to us. They had them and they looked delicious and when we inquired they suggested we order them , too. So we did. And they were good. Very tasty and I could see myself ordering them again.Billy's Chocolate Budino (delectable chocolate mousse w/ heavenly salted caramel & cocoa nibs) - Our server really enjoyed serving us as did our table runner so they decided to surprise us with this special gratis dessert. Great surprise. And very tasty. This dessert is very unique and not something you see on other menus. I'd recommend trying it. I'd also recommend the gelato sampler which our table neighbors ordered and judging by their clean plate after I'd say it's worth a go plus it looked delicious and that's what I probably would have ordered had we not be surprised with a free sweet treat.

If you don't like EDM or don't even know what EDM stands for, you may not appreciate the trance and house playlist here; as a dance music junkie I adored the music.

Arancini stuffed with prosciutto cotto and Fontina popped with flavor, but even better were crisp little crostini topped with an ethereal chicken liver mousse, a wisp of pancetta, and aged balsamic vinegar. Although truffled garlic bread needed more truffle, it certainly beat regular ol' bread. I haven't been to Spiaggia yet, but RPM puts out some of the best house-made pasta I've had the pleasure of eating thus far.

The Bill's Budino for dessert was very good and a strong recommend.For our second visit, again we waited over 25 minutes past our reservation for our table, I asked the hostess for the GM's business card and we were then seated shortly. A manager came over and apologized and offered some complimentary starters which was nice, but poor management and overbooking seem to be standard here.

Then finally on a Sunday in December we made it. This place transported me from the blustery Chicago winter to the sunny West Coast. The clean lines, black and white interior complimented with metallic accents (champagne, gold, etc), and upbeat club/lounge-y music was so not \"Midwestern.\" Everything about this place screamed LA- which was cool in my book.My Mom, sister, and I went here after meandering throughout the city window shopping during the holiday hustle and bustle. We took our time perusing the menu. The one thing to note about RPM is that it is a far cry from your \"typical Italian fare.\" Think tasting sized plates / tapas meant to be shared. While I felt this was a nice way to order a lot of different things...my appetite was enormous. We ordered a bottle of wine to share amongst the table and started off with the polenta with poached egg, Parmesan and fresh black truffles. PS Black truffles were a specialty that we definitely took advantage of on this trip. The polenta was warm, creamy with an oozy egg. I wanted to scoop my garlic bread into it and just eat the whole bowl. PPS the truffled garlic bread. I die. Again, see truffles. We also had a salad - it was really good. I just can't remember which one it was listed. However, it has fennel and was really fresh and tasty. For our entrees we went with a special (that included truffles- big shocker!). It was homemade ravioli in a light sauce with fresh truffles shaved table-side. It was on the lighter side while our other pasta dish was heartier- short rib pappardelle. Some reviewer called it \"hormel chunks of beef with undercooked pasta.\" Seriously? It was nothing like that. \u00a0Then... it came time for coffee and dessert. Holy meatballs...it was my favorite part of the meal. We ordered three things - yeah, it was amazing. 1) Fresh Figs with Marscapone (Amazing), Hazelnut Tartufo, and Bill's Chocolate Budino. I could have done without the tartufo. It was good, but not great. The figs and budino were just heaven in my mouth. If you love salted caramel and chocolate, get Bill's dessert. I die, a second time. And just like that, I drooled thinking about it.The portions were perfect. The service was impeccable. The ambiance was sultry, yet family oriented. Does that make sense?

As always, we were late, even for such a late time, but they were able to seat us right away. We had a nice booth that overlooked the bar, and there was a DJ playing above us. The music didn't bother us at all, but it may have bothered others since it was directly over our heads. The ambiance of the place is absolutely beautiful with gorgeous lighting and furniture. It gives off a very classy, yet modern feel to it, but doesn't overdo it either. Below the booths, there are lighting fixtures which created an entirely different feel to the place. So now for the food... We ordered a bottle of Moscato which was kept chilled off to the side. What a perfect bottle of bubbly - not too dry or sweet. I can easily finish a bottle by myself... For the appetizer, I went with the plate of four cheeses (Robiola Bosina, Pecorino Sardo, Taleggio D.O.P, and Gorgonzola Dolce). Some of the cheeses came with two pieces, jam, and a few pieces of warm toast. It was unbelievable - honestly, best cheese I've tasted. For the entrees, I went with Giuliana's Italian Salad and my boyfriend had the 8 oz Fillet Mignon. He told me the fillet was better than he ever had at Wildfire which is a HUGE thing to say considering he lives by their meat! I wanted dessert, but by the time it came around to it, we were both so full. Our server, who by the way was perfectly attentive, brought out a complimentary dessert - two miniature chocolate and raspberry sorbetto's in cones, with a candle and a Happy Birthday piece.

All were great! My personal favorite was the Shredded Brussels Sprouts with bread crumbs and avocado. My boyfriend was a huge fan of Giuliana's Italian Salad with the mix of peppers and meat. Others at the table really enjoyed the Tuscan Kale with the spinach and cheese.Then, we tried four pastas: Mama DePandi's Bucatini Pomodoro, Short Rib Pappardelle, Ricotta Raviolo, and the Sweet Corn Agnolotti. As many know, Mama DePandi's dish is what spiraled into the ideas of creating RPM. It was hands down my favorite pasta. It lived up to the hype! If you are only going to order one pasta, definitely order it! Others at the table really liked the sweet corn agnolotti. It was a unique type of pasta stuffed with a sweet corn sauce. Finally for dinner, we had the Sea Bass and the Prime Dry- Aged Bristecca Fiorentina. The sides that were served were garlic whipped potatoes and sauteed broccolini. The steak was incredible! Unbelievable seasoning and salty around the crust. I don't like fish, so I am not a good judge of the Sea Bass. The potatoes and broccolini were both received well by the table.For dessert, we had the baked cannoli, rice pudding gelato, and Bill's Chocolate Budino. The cannoli was great with an orange flavor! The rice pudding gelato was well received. Many commented it was the best rice pudding they have had! My personal favorite was Bill's Chocolate Budino. Wow!

Some places separate a lively bar from the dining room with a wall and, while I understand the sentiment, I liked the adult vibe at RPM.I was also very surprised by the menu prices. Two people could easily eat here for less than $50 which was somewhat of a shock given its downtown location.I decided that I wanted to try as much as I could and my date agreed so we ordered the following:Charred pepperoni pizetteProvolone stuffed peppersPrime beef meatballsCaesar wedge (with anchovy)Lobster ravioliCarbonaraFor all of that, the bill was only $75 (or so). So RPM deserves a lot of praise for being an incredible value!The pizettes are only $8 but are small. The flavor's good but, for me, this is small enough that I'd rather see a larger version for $12 - $15. As soon as I got into it, it was gone!The wedge was fantastic. It was accompanied by what I can only assume were polenta croutons and the best peppercorn dressing ever.The meatballs had a veal taste to me. I'm a fan but some may not enjoy. Prime beef typically means 'young' beef so buyer beware.The provolone stuffed peppers were more enjoyed by me than my date. Not sure why she didn't dig them to be fair but they were exactly as I would have guessed.The carbonara was served with a raw egg mixed into the dish at the table. It had a savory, comforting flavor and texture that I can still taste. Perfect meal if you're looking for something to stick to you!The ravioli was a big win for me as well. Whenever you order ravioli as an entree, you know you're only going to get 4-5 ravioli so it has to be an entree based on incredible taste more than portion.And this delivered. The lobster was evident in the flavor of the dish but wasn't overwhelming. When you compare the quality of the food to the low menu prices, RPM is an incredible value.

Our dogs have their own personal dog park in our yard.4. The silence (comparatively).And when we still get asked questions like \"but where do you EAT?\", we respond with a wink: \"we drive into the city\". There are many, many good places to eat in the suburbs, but once a month anyway, \u00a0we make the big, bad drive in to the city (because it is usually late on the Saturday this takes us an easy thirty minutes). Some restaurants are not even worth that much time in the car, but RPM Italian is worth the drive. I made reservations two and a half months out for 7:30pm on a Saturday. This was our first night out as a married couple and the first Saturday after my husband's birthday, so this was going to be a pretty ceremonial dinner. The waitress brought us a prosecco toast for both celebrations and a homemade ricotta (with pomodoro) that was amazing. The bread served with it looked like it would be a hard french loaf, but was soft. The ricotta was served with a little olive oil, which made it taste even better than any ricotta I have ever had.The service was warm, but unobtrusive. We had a lot of information about the menu before we ordered and I think we ordered well.

Mama DePandi's Bucatini Pomodoro with the gluten-free pasta, which you would never be able to tell was gluten-free by taste, and one meatball (because apparently you can order just one meatball on the side-- nice option). The Bone-in Ribeye, which came without a lot of garnishments and sauces; it was just a really nicely cooked steak, well-seasoned. Grilled Giant Prawns, which were very herb-y and needed the lemon that came with it sprayed all over it. Saut\u00e9ed Broccolini, which was a nice complement. For dessert, we had this gelato-filled mocha crunch ball... so, so good. The thing about this meal is that I was full, but not stuffed. They were nice portions and, if you share the pasta, you get a nice sampling of a lot of flavors. The price of the meal is what completely surprised me.

We'd made a reservation on a night we didn't think would be busy, but even with a reservation it was a 20+ minute wait for a non-bar table. At least they were very attentive and offered drinks at the bar. First of all, prices kinda shocked me. I really assumed the entrees would be in the high $20s to mid $30s; alas, no, and we soon found out why. Our first appetizer was the raw salami and cheese plate (totally forgot the name of it), which was delicious. The bread was acceptable, but wasn't complimentary, which was disappointing. I've been to similarly-priced places where the chef is so offended you don't order his bruschetta he makes it for free (his boss isn't too happy, I'm sure). A great modern Italian place needs a great Caesar salad. RPM's, sadly, was more show than anything else. It was literally vertical: the lettuce was on its side standing up with dressing and parmesan and anchovies on top of it. Looked great, a b***h and a half to cut and eat. It got messy. The dressing wasn't flavorful enough for my tastes, there were very few anchovies, and the \"croutons\" were fried tofu; not to my liking at all. To be honest, it remained a sour point.Then we found out why it's not very expensive: incredibly small portions. I had the lobster ravioli (divine), but it was over $20 for 5 average-sized raviolis. They were the best I've ever had, however. Not worth that much, but the lobster/ricotta filling was wonderful, and my friend's squid-ink spaghetti dish was \"very authentic.\" Add in 2 drinks and all the appetizers, and it was almost $100 before tax and tip. Way too pricey for what you get. I'd say I almost went home hungry, and I'm the one who always takes home leftovers for tomorrow.I will note that our waiter was great. The RPM staff are all dressed wonderfully to match the modern and chic restaurant decor.

Thus, if you arrive at 6:45 in the hopes of getting a 7:00 or 7:30 table, you will likely succeed. \u00a0However, I suggest that you reserve a dining room table if that is not your style because being a vulture may annoy you because it constitutes work and annoys the people whose departure you await.Onto the food: the appetizers are well-done, simple Italian. \u00a0For the lighter fare, the garlic bread is not heavy but light and tasty with just enough pecorino to balance the garlic. \u00a0The 600-day prosciutto will entrance you so much that you wonder why you do not just stock the stuff at home. \u00a0(Oh, wait, because I eat it all as soon as I get home from the grocery store.) \u00a0The octopus lacks any fishy flavor at all; it tastes the way good frutti di mare should taste: like a buttery, rich, and tart protein. \u00a0And the meatballs, although simple, are not greasy at all...just that sweet pork and beef goodness set in a simple pomodoro and topped with still more pecorino.From there to the main course, our party sampled the pappardelli, the gnocchi, the carbonara, and the cavatelli. \u00a0Each had the correct portion size--not the \"fat American\" size. \u00a0As we sampled each others' plates, it became clear that the pappardelli and carbonara were the clear favorites. \u00a0The pappardelli had the richness you would expect, but again lacked the grease that a cheaper version of it would have. \u00a0Its base was again that lovely pomodoro, which the chef had reduced to coat the pasta generously but not sloppily. \u00a0The carbonara was REAL carbonara rather than what shitty restaurants do, which is pass off an over-glorified and incorrect alfredo as carbonara. \u00a0No, this was the real deal complete with an egg broken and mixed tableside. \u00a0Perfetto!! \u00a0The gnocchi were expertly crafted and their sausage and cream-based sauce coated them expertly as well, but the other two plates were just out of this world and blew away both it and the cavatelli.As for dessert and coffee, RPM does not cut corners on the smaller things. \u00a0I had the gelato coated with chocolate hazelnut crust of sorts. \u00a0It was like biting into a super-chocolaty ice cream ball coated with a \"Crunch\" candy bar...with hazelnut. \u00a0If you're more traditional like I am, then you will be pleased to know that they have the full espresso bar complimented with a wide selection of ports and dessert wines. \u00a0Get a spoon or fork for everyone at the table if you get this.I need not comment on the service other than to say it was excellent.I do not usually think very highly of a non-neighborhood Italian place, but RPM Italian achieved the quality control of a 10-table venue with a chic, quasi-fine-dining experience. \u00a0Well done!", "Date": "2014-02-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Hariharan V.", "ReviewID": "cnU9CUUyEYg3KfR0WcMaRg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Always a treat.

Sure, it felt like the restaurant in the Matrix with all the pretty people measuring me up while I was being taken to my table. (Remember the Merovingian?) It really is a great atmosphere (formerly Ben Pao), but I'm there to eat which is where things go south. Started with some appetizers including the fried olives, lobster caprese and mediterranean octopus. All were nice with complimentary bread. The wedge salad ($13) was nice as was Giuliana's Italian Salad ($11) which was split between the ladies in the group. My problem was with the \"entrees\" and their size. I ordered the butternut agnolotti ($14) which was barely more than an appetizer itself. Finished in 60 seconds. So I ask for the menu again and order the Strozzapreti (arugula pesto with pine nuts) ($10), still quite small by even European standards. Also, I don't want to share my plate as was suggested by our tatted waitress. I want to walk away full, but not uncomfortably so.

Here's the run down:Hostess - zero sense of hospitality. Didn't make eye contact, didn't feel welcomed, zero effort in the greeting.Table - nice. Restaurant is modern and large. Tons of white-coated servers, huge staff. Food - \"meant to be shared\" is one thing. But with the unacceptably small portion sizes, we weren't sharing: we were fighting over the scarce amount of food. Small plates are cool, but price them accordingly. On no planet should a salad the size of a McDonald's $1 side salad be priced at $11. On no planet should pasta that's smaller than a serving of E-Z mac be $10. Italian food that's meant to be shared is also meant to be hearty: meatballs as big as a softball. Pasta trays that can barely be picked up and passed around they are so heavy. At RPM, you better order one of everything and bring your checkbook if you plan on leaving anywhere near satiated.Here's what we had:Giuliana's salad - glorified tossed salad with a few pieces of salami that is extremely difficult to share.Giuliana's mom's pasta, the bucatini pomodoro - good flavor. Portion size less than a fist-full. Eggplant Parmesan - so sub par I can't even believe it.

On one hand, I liked most of the food, but the \"scene\" is not really my style, especially at the bar, where it's a version of the bros that hang in Wrigleyville, except with more disposable income. I got to experience some of that while I was waiting for my friend to arrive for our recent dinner there.I got there a bit early, so I bellied up to the bar to enjoy a cocktail while I waited for her. The cocktail list wasn't all that impressive, so I stuck with my current go-to cocktail of a Tom Collins instead of one on their list. The bartender wasn't all that friendly and the drink was not good. In fact, I'm fairly sure it was made with lime juice; it certainly didn't taste like any Tom Collins I've ever had before.My friend got there and we were shown to our table. The dining room is very elegant and dramatic, and even at 5:30 (the only reservation time we could get on a Monday night!), it was quite crowded.Our waiter was jovial and gave us some guidance on the menu, and its focus on \"shared plates.\" I have to say, I'm really over this trend in food. When portion sizes are barely big enough for one person, how the heck are you supposed to share? Much to my chagrin, it looks like this trend shows no signs of letting up.Anyway, we zeroed in on lobster caprese salad, the truffled garlic bread that everyone raves about, fritto misto, roman-style artichokes, and the duck agnolotti.Things began arriving. As expected, the lobster caprese was ridiculously small: three tiny pieces of lobster, three or four grape tomatoes and three mozzarella balls. While it was very fresh, beautifully presented, and tasted delicious, it was barely more than a taste for each of us. And it was $16!!! I will say that the truffled garlic bread was a generous portion, and in this case, it was almost too much of a good thing as it was very rich.The fritto misto was fried calamari, shrimp, and some pieces of asparagus, and served with a lemon aioli. We both enjoyed this but I don't think either of us were blown away, but really, fried calamari and shrimp can only be so bold. The artichokes were quite tasty and I would definitely order those again.The duck agnolotti was also a small portion and this served as my friend's main course so I didn't try it. I was still hungry so I ordered the poached egg over polenta with shaved truffles. This dish was a disappointment. First of all, it was about 30 seconds undercooked so the white of the egg was still clear. Ick. I probably should have sent it back but I didn't. I just kind of ate around it. I didn't get much of the earthy truffle flavor, in fact, this dish didn't have a lot of flavor at all.I was anticipating dessert, but again, none of the selections seem worth the calorie splurge, so I declined. My friend opted for the rice pudding gelato. In hindsight, I wished I would have tried it as it sounded intriguing.

We opted for quite a few; the plate of 4 salumis, the meatballs, the fried olives stuffed with cheese and/or sausage, and the truffle garlic bread. 3 of the four salumis were great - we didn't like the pistachio mortadella because you couldn't taste the pistachio at all. The meatballs were FANTASTIC, really tender and succulent and surrounded by one of the best marinaras I've had outside of my Italian grandmothers kitchen! the olives were boring - they lost their brininess and bite by being fried. And the truffle garlic bread was nothing special - and you definitely could not taste the truffle on it.We also ordered two of the pastas; the Spicy king crab and the short rib pappardelle. We liked the Spicy King Crab better; it was a squid ink pasta with a spicy sauce and king crab meat - but even that had an overly fishy taste to it, like the crab wasn't fresh. The pappardelle was rather boring and there was something off about how they cooked the fresh pasta.We would give the restaurant another chance for the food, as there were many other menu items that we thought sounded good but didn't get to order, but I think one of the most disappointing things was the overall service.

I came with a couple of girlfriends for a late-night dinner after a show at the House of Blues, and we couldn't have been happier. While not dressed in sequin cocktail dresses and heels, we came for a great meal and got it delivered. Best of all, especially since it was a late dinner, we left feeling completely satisfied but not wishing someone would deflate our stomachs. This is a great option whether it's before going out for a late-night dance-a-thon or if you simply want a quality meal in a convenient location.THE RUNDOWNCocktails - Average at best. We tried four different cocktails and really only enjoyed one of them. I cannot remember the name, but I know it contained Gin and St. Germain. There's a reason why it's the most popular.Fresh Burrata - Considering burrata is a great cheese, this dish is almost impossible to mess up. A ball of burrata is served with a salty outside layer and arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, and toasted bread on the side. A great dish, but considering this easily can be made at home, I'll probably spend my money on another next time.Beef Carpaccio - Sliced thinly to perfection. Chunks of pecorino add a saltiness to the dish that was welcomed.Tuscan Kale and Heirloom Spinach Salad - In my mind, crunchy chopped kale, lemon juice, olive oil, and parmesan is a great combination, and this salad did not disappoint. This dish is great if you're looking for something light and refreshing.Polenta and Poached Egg - I love polenta and I love poached egg, so why wouldn't I love polenta with poached egg? If you're familiar with the perfection that is runny egg yolk and what it can do to a dish, then you'll love this, too. Anytime I thought I might want to add a tad bit more salt, I took a bite with the truffle and the parmesan, which made it great.Wood-Grilled Octopus - The octopus was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was served on top of a chickpea puree which tasted like a lighter, more lemony and garlicky- flavored hummus. Delicious.Duck Agnolloti - Great dish. I love duck, and the pillowy pasta that it was served with was perfect. Leaves of brussel sprouts added a little bit of crunch. No sauce is served with this pasta, but the cooked (roasted?) mission figs added so much flavor that sauce was not missed.Spicy King Crab Pasta - Squid-ink pasta cooked perfectly with chunks of king crab and hot peppers. I thought the spiciness was a great level without overpowering the dish. But, if you don't like spice, you can always opt out of the hot peppers. But really, do yourself a favor and stick with the hot peppers.Rice Pudding Frozen Yogurt - Such a great combination. A great cinnamon flavor that was light and sweet enough for a post-meal bite.Sour cream sorbet - So incredibly weird, but so incredibly good. We had it by itself, but we were told it's usually served with a pineapple carpaccio. If you can get a little taste of the sorbet, go for it.A fig dessert that I can't remember the name of - Very light. The figs were served with some roasted nuts, a peanut type of concoction, and what I think was creme fraiche with syrup drizzled on top.

Beware though - 1 of us thought it was too salty/herby. I still think it's a dish to recommend.-Prosciutto Tortelloni - This one grew on me - wasn't loving it at first (perhaps because the prosciutto inside the tortelloni seemed a bit dry).

This flavor of this dish is more subtle than that of the Parpadelle and the Ravioli (see below). -Ricotta Ravioli with an Egg and Truffle (Special of the Day) - Favorite dish of the night!Dessert:-Bill's Chocolate Budino - these cocao bits inside the caramel were a plus! Very thick and heavy but I loved the combination.-Sweet Corn Gelato with Blueberry Sauce (Special of the Day) - Sounds like an odd combination but it really works.

Very nice size chunks of Lobster and the mozzarella was super fresh and tasty.3. Grilled Octupus - I liked that they cut up the octopus, and you could really taste the smoke from the grill. Very light and refreshing.4. Guiliana's Salad - This was my favorite of the night in terms of small plates. The dressing was very light and delicious. The salami, cheese, peppercini's all added a great element to the salad. It was very simple, but VERY good.5. Polenta with Poached egg. Very buttery and very good. 6. Frito Misto - This was not overly greasy and I liked that there was shrimp, calamari, green beans and lemons. It was actually very light and cooked perfectly!7. Mama Depandi's Bucatini Pomodoro - Very good. Noodles were cooked to perfection, I loved the sauce, it was SO good.8. Short Rib Pappardelle - YUM! This surprisingly was my favorite of the pasta dishes. I love fresh pasta, I loved the sauce and the short ribs melted in your mouth. SO good!9 & 10. were the desserts, I am not sure what they were called, but the Chocolate Ball Ice Cream was SOOO good, the Hazelnut with the Rosemary Gelato wasnt so great, but maybe it was because the mixture of the two didnt work so well? Not sure? It was a great time had by all, and I liked the vibe of the place. I almost liked that we were in the bar versus the restaurant as it was definitely more fun!

At first I was a little annoyed due to the fact we were seated 20 mins after our reservation. But as soon as we were seated a manager came over to our table and apologized for the wait and brought us 2 appetizers on the house. Right away, my annoyance with the wait left me and I was able to enjoy my dinner entirely. The manager brought us the Ricotta toast and the stuffed peppers. The stuffed peppers were okay, probably the only item I had all night that I could have done without. Now the Ricotta toast was absolutely delicious. I did not anticipate enjoying this too much since I am not big into cheeses, but I could have eaten the whole plate alone if I didn't need to share it with my boyfriend. I also ordered for myself the wood oven mediterranean octopus which was to die for. It is a very small plate and not very filling but definitely a must try if you enjoy octopus.For dinner I ordered the classic spaghetti and meatball and my boyfriend ordered the bucatini pomodoro with a side of the prime beef meatballs. We both devoured our plates. Anyone can make spaghetti and meatball, but this plate had such rich flavors and was not like any regular spaghetti and meatball dish I've ever had, on top of the meatball being HUGE! For dessert we shared the tartufo. This looks and almost tastes like a giant Ferrero Rocher but with chocolate ice cream inside. It is amazing!

I really wanted to like this place. The decor is very modern and well designed, albeit loud. And our server was extremely patient, very informative and provided just the right amount of attentiveness. You know what I mean - there when needed him, but not overbearing and in the way. And the dirty vodka martini with blue cheese olives was delicious. But sadly, I can't give much more praise than that. And I really, really wanted to. \u00a0Perhaps I'm biased by the impression I had before even stepping foot inside. The valet experience was horrible. It wasn't the fault of the guys doing the actual valeting - but whoever is/was in charge of setting it up and coordinating the logistics and traffic flow is terrible. I pulled up behind a car. Apparently, three other cars thought it was a valet line, too, and pulled in behind me. Then I discovered that there was no one in the car in front of me. And the valets were not coming to move it. So I got out of the car and waved to the valet. He gestured that I needed to pull up. \"I can't!\" The three cars behind me saw this exchange and were able to pull around me. The valet eventually came over to get my car.The food was decent, but not worth the price. Don't get me wrong -I don't mind paying for a great dinner. But the food has to be worth it. It was our monthly girls' night out and we shared an assortment of appetizers and pasta plates. Except for the fried olives, none of the appetizers really made an impression as something I can only get there and make me want to return. The potato gnocchi was my choice for one of our pasta plates, and while the sauce was really good, the potato gnocchi itself was really squishy and fair, at best. \u00a0 Speaking of girls' night out - this seems to be the trendy spot for such an activity. I'm pretty sure that more than half the tables were groups of 4+ women. There's nothing wrong with that, but it just gave me an impression that apparently this is the current \"It\" place. But you know how that cycle goes. I don't think it will be as popular once the trendiness wears off and girls' nights move on to the next It restaurant. One of the people in my party predicts it will be closed within 18 months. If not, it will be because of the support it receives as part of the LEYE group.And back to the valet. I lost track of how long it took for my car to arrive. I do recall excusing myself from the table a while before my friends. When they eventually came out of the restaurant, they couldn't believe I was *still* waiting for my car. \u00a0I still tipped the valet, but they didn't have correct change for one of my friends (even including her tip). And the car I got stuck behind when I arrived? Yeah...three hours after my arrival it was still parked in its same spot.There are plenty of other Italian restaurants in Chicago.

The vibe of the place was young and hip. Everyone was dressed very nicely.We had a bottle of the Pinot Nero and it was one of the best Pinot's I've had. We started with the bread and fresh ricotta, the lobster caprese, and the cheese stuffed peppers. The lobster was so overpriced it was offensive. The cheese stuffed peppers were fine, nothing special. The fresh ricotta cheese was without a doubt the star of the dinner, actually the whole weekend in fact. I've never had fresh ricotta like that, I will definitely look out for it in restaurants from now on. We got Mama DePandi's pasta with a meatball and the papardelle. I had seen many pictures of the meatball on Yelp and it looked huge, but they gave me one teeny tiny meatball. What the heck?! The pasta was great but the sauce was very basic. My bf said it tasted like jarred sauce, and I told him that other Yelpers had the same comment. The paprdelle was delicious, I would highly recommend that.For dessert we had the peaches with pistachio cake and the hazlenut tartufo. I had to get the tartufo after seeing the pictures. I thought it was great! The peach consisted of peaches, a little pistachio cake, and pistachio ice cream on top. The peaches were canned and I was appalled.

We all knew Bill Rancic was a good business man - but he is really hit a home run with this one. It's exactly what Chicago (and River North) needed! A trendy restaurant where I can get delicious food that doesn't involve eating sweetbreads or pork belly? Yes, please. The restaurant isn't your typical Italian restaurant with checkered table clothes and over-sized portions that you want to fall asleep after eating. It is modern, has a great bar, plenty of room, and portions are perfect. Those who complain of them being too small - just order more! Prices are very reasonable! Plus, I didn't find the portions to be that small, at all. For a group of 4 we each ordered our own pasta - and it was plenty since we had ordered apps, garlic bread, and meatballs to share. The smaller portion allows you to enjoy other things on the menu. Everything I've had here is great - if I were to make two recommendations it would be the garlic bread and the meatballs. Best I've ever had. I agree with some that the service isn't top notch - but no one was rude. Just a bit slow/clueless. I'm sure (or I hope) time will solve this.

I would go back and just drink at their bar to try more of their wines again.We had the following dishes and there was only one dish that we thought was poor:- Truffled Garlic Bread (4/5)- Charred Pepperoni Pizette (5/5)- Prime Beef Meatballs (5/5)- Tuna Carpaccio (4/5)- Maine Lobster Ravioli (4/5)- Truffled Farfalle (2/5)The portions are the appropriate size so that you leave satisfied but not uncomfortably full. The truffled farfalle was pretty bland and not in the same league as all the other dishes. The Beef Sugo in the dish didn't stand out and the sauce seemed to have a water base than cream or anything else. The Pepperoni Pizette was very good and well priced at $7. Better than any other pizza in River North especially Rosebuds effort.The Prime Beef meatballs were the best item on the menu and in a lovely marinara sauce. We loved dipping the truffled garlic bread into the sauce.The Tuna Carpaccio was also very fresh and seasoned perfectly. The Maine Lobster Ravioli was very good, the sauce with it could have been better buy it was still a very good effort.For dessert we had the Black Mission Figs (they had sold out of the cannolis) and the Lemoncello Sorbetto. Both were very good and were a nice finish to the dinner.It was very reasonably priced with gratuity and wine bringing the tab to $150.

AND WHEN WE ARRIVED, oh my dear lord - my little Sicilian soul was giddy with delight. The decor is very trendy, all black and white, but when you start eating its old school Sicily in your mouth. My suggestion is to come to RPM with A LOT of people. That way you can try as many things as possible and pick off of everyone's plate. We went here during Restaurant Week in February and none of us could stick to the Restaurant Week menu. We went NUTS ordering the homemade ricotta (A MUST), toasts with chicken livers, arancini, grilled octopus (A MUST), and the fried olives. The red sauce they give you with the arancini tasted EXACTLY like my Sicilian great-grandmother's, an amazing surprise. We were dipping that ricotta crostini in that gravy like it was going out of style. The olives were really unique and just salty enough, definitely worth trying. The rest of the apps were good, but my favorites and must haves were definitely the grilled octopus with garbanzo beans (a texture AND flavor explosion) and the ricotta.For our meals, we each got a different pasta. I went with the king crab with squid ink pasta, one friend got the gnocchi, and the other friend got the Maine Lobster Ravioli. The King Crab was PHENOMENAL. So much flavor, just enough spice, creamy, TONS of crab meat, and such a great portion that I ate my leftovers for breakfast the next morning and they were STILL delicious. I also liked the Maine Lobster Ravioli A LOT, it was really creamy and had great lobster flavor. The gnocchi was good, it had the same Sunday gravy we had with the arancini and a boatload of cheese.For dessert, there wasn't even a decision to be made. I'm one of those people that if cannolis are on the menu, you don't have to sell me, I'm ordering the damn things no matter what. Thank God RPM didn't let me down - they were DELICIOUS, complete with crumbled pistachios on the shell. Oh and the pistachio gelato was worthy of a try as well.Throughout all of our ordering and ravings about what we were eating, our waiter was phenomenal keeping everything timed perfectly, being very attentive and quick with the wine, and helping out with suggestions when necessary. And it didn't hurt that he was easy on the eyes and looking quite dapper in his white tuxedo.

We arrived a bit early, hoping to sit at the bar; but it was jam-packed. There is both a wrap-around bar that people were dining at and bar tables that people were dining at; so felt al ittle funny cramming between people eating dinner to order drinks. We settled in the lobby to wait and people-watch. And oh my, what a scene. This place is definitely attracting the see and be seen crowd in Chicago and we saw them all, including fabulously inappropriate outfits. Worth it just for that! Promptly at 10pm, we were seated at a table near the DJ in the back. We loved our table, as it had a view of the entire bar/restaurant (and conveniently located near the E! cameras who were filming G&B!). The servers were sweet and attentive an the wine list was comprehensive but not overwhelming. We LOVED the menu! Its broken into many small plates, salads, appetizers, pastas and then more traditional entrees. We liked that the menu was set up for sharing and we tried several items including Mama DePandi's pasta, brussels sprouts salad, fresh burrata, chicken livers, stuffed peppadew peppers, polenta with poached egg. It seems like alot (ok, it was); but the portions are sized perfectly for sharing.We LOVEd the baby peppadew peppers stuffed with provolone. The chicken liver crostinis were smooth and rich. My friend loved Mama DePandi's pasta; I'm not a huge fan of bucatini; but the sauce was fresh and bright. My polenta with a runny egg and tuffle oil was all comfort and the fresh burrata was tangy with the right amount of chew. The brussels sporuts salad was the only miss for us. It looked gorgeous with the shredded sprouts; but they were raw, and a bit too astringent and with the tangy dressing; it just felt a little off with the comfort food array we had. So the wine, food, atmosphere and service was wonderful....BUT....the DJ? HORRIBLE. I realize we were sort of in the back of the bar area and it was late on a Friday night; but when you have a dining room full of people eating dinner (which there was at this hour); please do not pump the house music at full volume.

Here's what I did find attractive, the decor. Definitely my style, very trendy, all black and white interior, high lamps, not too dark inside and good looking people everywhere in sight. It's definitely a place to see and be seen, however we were there the night before the Oscars so Giuliana unfortunately was no where to be seen. The place was jam packed at 6pm on a Saturday night when we had our reservation, not a place to breathe. Luckily, I requested a booth so our seating arrangement was a little better and more private. However, it was still loud and I think the place is more appropriate for a girls night out than a romantic first date. Way too loud and if you don't have a good table, you're more than likely to sit on top of your neighbors, and with all the loud music, where is the romance in that? Trendy, show off your Louboutins place? Yes that it is. Now onto the food, I'm sorry for the not cheap prices, I was expecting better. I know they are small plates which isn't a problem for me since you can try more, but I did not love anything that we ordered. Everything was average and doesn't make me want to come back.-Ricotta cheese in oil with a tomato sauce and toast- I've definitely had better quality Ricotta, but the bread was good. -Brussel Sprout and Avocado Salad-It was almost on every table and our server said it was exceptional. I'm sorry, it was way too chewy and raw tasting. The flavors also didn't do it for me.-Meatballs in a tomato sauce-These were okay. Once again, I've had better and I would have preferred them to be a little more spicy.-Lobster Ravioli- This was my favorite dish of what we had, but where was the lobster? You only get 5 tiny ravioli's for $15.00. Kinda a rip off. -Tartufo-the most talked about dessert. It was a big ferrero rocher ball filled with gelato. It was very tasty, but I guess not the perfect dessert to get when it's snowing in February but definitely a summer delight. Try it.Our server was a tad pretentious and I didn't want drinks as I wasn't feeling well so he kinda gave us an attitude as if ordering tea was unacceptable here.

The d\u00e9cor is very modern and chic. \u00a0I felt cool just walking to our table. \u00a0The service was good, but not amazing. \u00a0We decided to do the restaurant week menu although I felt our server was trying to talk us out of it. They give you a sample of two cicchetti options. The crispy ravioli was so good, like little spa pillows in your mouth. The other cicchetti was provolone stuffed peppers. That was a total disappointment. They were small red peppers with the tops cut off and a piece of cheese thrown inside. It was drizzled with a light dressing, but I expected it to be warm. For the first course I got the Giuliana Italian Salad. It was by far the most unhealthy salad I've ever had, but so yummy, loved it! \u00a0I also had the Sicilian pork dish. The pork was very tender and moist. It came with polenta and kale which made a great complete meal since most of the entrees don't come with sides. \u00a0The dessert was a thumbs down. We had the chocolate sorbetto. It was a bowl of super sweet pudding. \u00a0We couldn't eat it because it was so rich. I do have to say that I didn't get any of their cocktails. The bar was very busy and crowded. I am intrigued about their whole bar scene and would like to give it a try.

Maybe I watch Giuliana & Bill too much. Maybe this place just wasn't that special. It really kills me to say that b/c I wanted to loooooove it & sing it's praises but it just didn't wow me.My friend \"scored\" a 10:30pm reservation on a Saturday night & as soon as we walked in, I thought to myself \"this must be where the pretty people hang out\". Seriously, the staff & guests were all quite good looking. We were seated in a booth towards the back of the dining room & started with drinks. I had one of the specialty drinks which was not memorable at all so I moved on to a pear martini, which oddly tasted a lot like the first drink. For apps we had burrata, ricotta, & fritto misto. The burrata was extremely disappointing- everyone at the table didn't know what it was so I talked it up & convinced them to order it so I was embarrassed when it was tiny & not as creamy as I'm used to. The ricotta & fritto misto were just okay- nothing special.We all ordered pasta dishes- I had the squid ink pasta w/crab. It was good but not exactly something I will crave in the future. All the portions were quite small so I don't recommend these as a main dish (unless it's after 11pm & you're not starving); I think they're more so meant to be a shard item before your entree.The one memorable part of the evening that I would actually return for was dessert. We had cannoli, the chocolate hazelnut ball thingy (obviously I forgot the name), & mini ice cream cones (it was my bday in a few days so this was the comp'd dessert). Everything was delicious- especially the ice cream! I don't eat dairy at home & when I'm out & decide to indulge, I want it to be worth it & this definitely was!

A good mix of business types and friends looking for a night out mid-week, and I dont know if it was just the night we were there but the crowd was quite beautiful (including servers, bartenders, etc). The bar was packed, too.Wanted to share a bottle of wine, and when we couldnt decide which one our server was nice enough to bring out several tasting glasses. Then we started with the roman style artichokes and the truffle garlic bread...yum, yum. The portion on the artichokes was good for 2-3 people...so I'd recommend ordering more starters if you have a large group.We followed this with a bowl of Mama DePandi's pasta and the Farfalle dish. They weren't humongous pasta dishes that a lot of (ahem, chain) italian restaurants bring you. Just the right portion for us ladies. Lots of flavor, and the beef in the farfalle dish was to die for!! So tender, it just fell apart on your fork. We finished with a fig dessert. It was light and fresh, just that little bit of sweetness that we wanted. Would like to see a few more options on the dessert menu though in the future.A few small kinks in service, mostly because the place is only 3 weeks old and our server was super busy.

We each had a small portion, probably better to be shared between 2. The entrees were all delicious. I had Mama DePandi's bucatini pomodoro. It was really delicious. Fresh pasta and a tasty red sauce that had a tiny kick to it. I wish there was a little more cheese on top. I suppose I could have asked but didn't.

The person who said in her review it's a spot for mid-to-late 20s and early-to-mid 30's is dead on. And she's also right that you'll see people at the bar dressed up to go out because it's a popular spot for dinner before people hit up River North hot spots like Paris Club, EPIC or the new place on Kinzie, Untitled. Our group had a table in a slightly more private space toward the back of the room. It's a nice table for as many as 12 if you have a big party. You'll be the only table in that space, but it does open up to the rest of the restaurant, so you won't be secluded. I will say everyone said that every single thing they ate was delicious with just one appetizer (the pasta puffs) that no one was impressed by. They taste like Pop Chips. Ain't nothin' wrong with Pop Chips - just not at a nice restaurant like this. What I can say was OUTSTANDING were the prime beef meatballs. Never had a meatball so tender in my life. We each had one as shared small plates and I loved it so much, I had to order more meatballs as my entree with a side of asparagus. The creamy polenta was ridiculously tasty. Someone ordered a filet they said was excellent. Our birthday girl got gnocchi and loved it. Another girl got Giuliana's salad, which she had once before and loved enough to want it again. I also really appreciate they have a number of gluten-free options and they even have it printed on the bottom of the menu that a gluten-free menu is available.

I was lured here because of my slight appreciation for the Rancics. However, the \"soft core\" epicurean in me was quite skeptical of the level of food I would find. Often \"Hollywood celebrity\" restaurants and some \"star chef\" establishments wind up being more pomp than substance. RPM's food was delightfully (and somewhat surprisingly) delicious and on par with some of the finer establishments in Chicago. I ordered a Padua Sour for a cocktail. It's Grey Goose, Aperol, Lemon, and Orange Bitters. It's well-balanced and not too sweet yet not too bitter. We started off with a side of the prime beef meatballs and truffle oil garlic bread. WOW. Paired together... it's magical. Sop up some of that meatball sauce with the garlic bread and seriously... you could make a meal out of that alone! So good! One side of the bread, however, wasn't toasted as well as the other side. Half the bread was a little softer and less crispy, but no big deal... still packed a wallop of flavor. We also ordered three pastas. (They're all small portions.) Instantly, I suspected the short rib pappardelle would be fantastic... and it was. Easily my favorite pasta of the night. It had melt-in-your-mouth short rib meat on top of a bed of pappardelle pasta and a lovely tomato/bolognese sauce. There was a hint of rosemary and pecorino as well. The butternut agnolotti was also quite nice; a little bit on the sweeter side, of course. The proscuitto tortelloni was a toss-up. On the one hand, I liked that they were shaped like dumplings and the meat (for good and bad reasons) tasted like breakfast sausage links. (Jimmy Dean, anyone?) Now, I admit I do love sausage, but I didn't think the flavors would resemble a generic type of breakfast meat. The dumpling skin was a bit tough as well. I think maybe one more minute of cooking or steaming or whatever would've softened it just right. The sauce for the tortelloni was also quite forgettable. It was a clear and somewhat creamy sauce with parsley. While not a complete failure, that was my least favorite of the night. We also ordered the chicken liver crostini with pancetta. I understand these are one-bite crostinis, but there was way too much liver for each piece of bread. It should've been scaled down a bit... or they could've put it on a larger piece of crostini. Lastly, we ordered the tarfufo for dessert. Okay I am really glad we decided to share this dessert since it was massive! It's basically one huge ferrero rocher... not that I'm complaining! It resembled that candy in both flavor and presentation. It's definitely an eye-catching dessert and turned heads from the tables around us. The table next to us had to know what we were eating. \"Tartufo!\" we said, and they stared at it for some time. (Hmm... I kinda felt uncomfortable with the staring! [Which is why I don't like it when restaurant tables are put so close together. AWKWARD!]) Anyway! The tartufo was also served with two very small-mouthed spoons with large handles (that was actually a bit annoying since I felt a fork would be easier to eat with for this monstrosity.) The ambiance of the restaurant: gorgeous. I loved the ceiling light fixtures, and the restaurant's overall clean lines do not distract you from your meal and who you're with. We had a 8:00 PM reservation on Monday. It was moderately dim in the restaurant, but come ~8:30ish, they dimmed it more and bumped the \"untz-untz-untz\" music higher. The serving staff all wear white coats (must be scary to serve tomato sauce with!) and the hostesses/hosts (from what I remember) all wore black. Very coordinated uniforms there, RPM!

Not sure how to describe it, it's chewy and \"bouncy\" at the same time. Not hard nor smushy. I took out 1 star because the price seems very reasonable on the menu, but the portion is kind of small. Isn't Italian all about big portion? It worked out for my table because nobody wanted big portion at that time of the night, but if I were eating at an earlier time, I would have to order 2 pastas for myself.

I love to eat out and dine at some of Chicago's best restaurants but when it comes to Italian food, I set my standards to big meals and delicious bread with olive oil and cheese. \u00a0Wait... yes you have to pay $7 for bread here. \u00a0We didn't do that either.So after much deliberation on what we would all order we decided to try two appetizers based on reviews we had read: Frito Misto and Polenta with Poached Egg. \u00a0The fried fish was mediocre, I expect better calamari and the polenta was actually mushy and pretty gross. \u00a0I can't believe people recommended that as an appetizer. \u00a0We all went with Giuliana's Italian Salad which was delicious. \u00a0 Very good ingredients and the flavor was awesome. \u00a0My mom and aunt split this salad and the kitchen split it for them, I do love when restaurants accommodate that way. \u00a0For my entr\u00e9e I went with Carbonara pasta. \u00a0My boyfriend also ordered this pasta. \u00a0We both really enjoyed it, almost be worth asking them to double the order and paying $26 for a full portion. \u00a0Him and I also shared a side order of meatballs and paid to add 1 more so we each had 2. \u00a0They were good, but nothing over the top in flavor at all. \u00a0My boyfriend also ordered the smoked ricotta cavatelli which he said was good but again, not amazing. My brother had the eggplant parmesan which I don't think he was disappointed with but he was more or less looking for just a yummy chicken entr\u00e9e which clearly they don't really offer on their menu. \u00a0My mom and aunt split the Whole Grilled Branzino Sea Bass. \u00a0This dish was nicely plated and a decent portion at $58 and serves two. \u00a0Again this item is solo so for their side they split the strozzapreti. \u00a0I believe they ate less than \u00a01/2 of it because it just lacked taste. \u00a0It was overpowered by basil and just not really good.For dessert, we shared the Tartufo which was bland and the special gelato which was nutella and bananas which was probably the best part of the meal for all of us.After a few glasses of wine and all this food the bill was pretty up there and I don't think any of us left happy with the experience. \u00a0Well, what can I say? \u00a0I wanted to go RPM and I went but I do not feel the need to go back again.", "Date": "2012-10-31", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Claudia R.", "ReviewID": "RvKko5AmyrZ3RAwm2JbxHw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Service was good.

Glad I got the fried polenta because I don't think the lobster ravioli was filling enough. The fried polenta had some grated parmesan cheese.

The lemon aioli bumps the dish up to a whole other level (cue Emeril, \"BAM!\"). The short rib parpadelle achieves a complexity of simple that I admire. The portion size is very appropriate (*ahem* Cheesecake Factory), and it's hard to beat fresh pasta. The sauce is sweet but deep from the meat, and there is just enough to enjoy but not so much the pasta is swimming and overpowered.Dessert was surprisingly good.

The place was packed, even though it was pouring down hard outside. The first thing I noticed was how chic this place was. I'm not one for obnoxious chic, but this was a nice subtle chic that came across well. I immediately fell in love with the house music playing in the background.We got seated within ten minutes by our hostess. Since it was packed, we got seated in-between two tables near the back.

It made it hard to hold a conversation because you felt like you were talking over the person next to you. Luckily, our attentive waiter made up for the tight eating quarters.For starters, we ordered the Lobster Caprese, Proscuitto-Wrapped Figs and Truffled Garlic Bread. For drinks, since it was my lady's birthday, ordered a glass of house champagne and a bottle of Nora beer. The Lobster Caprese was nice and fresh, with the right amount of lobster and mozzarella in each bite. The Truffled Garlic Bread was very tastym, although it quickly became hard and unpalatable as it cooled down. The best part of the appetizers was the Proscuitto-Wrapped Figs which were melt-in-your mouth good. I keep thinking about them all the time. My girlfriend's house champagne was delicious and my Nora beer was refreshingly different, almost like a fine beer teetering on a gingery wine.For dinner, we got the Mama DePandi's Bucatini Pomodoro and the Spicy King Crab in Ink Spaghetti. I was looking forward to the Ink Spaghetti as I figured the taste combination would be interesting. It was good, but left a lot to be desired. The Pomodoro, which I thought would be underwhelming, was much more satisfying and the highlight of the main course.For desert, we decided to try the Tiramisu which was a special. It was moist and done extremely well. Since it was my girlfriend's birthday, they brought out two small scoops of sorbet in tiny cones.

No. \u00a0Its the scene-y place of the moment and all those come into their own in time and either make it or break it once the hype has settled. \u00a0thats just the business of the fickle dining scene. We observed many different groups of Diners, mostly the after Work crowd looking for a glass of wine and a few bites to share and call it Dinner. \u00a0To agree with other posters, yes, we spied the tourist faction dining, but the location lends itself to that and of course tourist $ are as good as local $. \u00a0 If you asked me where you would get the same or better Experience, i would tell you davanti enoteca on taylor or Quartino a few blocks away.

Did they just stop to work on way to the laudromat?

I went ahead and gave the hostess my cellphone number to text us if a table happened to open up sooner than the 90 minute time frame. \u00a0 From the menu we decided that the smaller plates and the pasta looked a lot more interesting than the steaks, chops, seafood, and slow-roasted entrees. So here's what we ordered: \u00a0 for starters we got the Roasted Beets with Gorgonzola and Pistachio ($13), the prosciutto-wrapped figs ($6), the Roman-Style Artichokes ($11),and the Eggplant Involtini with Burrata, Diablo Sauce and Smoked Ham ($13). \u00a0They all arrived to us pretty promptly and were delicious. \u00a0The beet dish was delightfully novel in its presentation; \u00a0the \u00a0Roman-Style Artichokes were unlike any artichoke dish we'd ever seen and were fun to eat - they were fried and there were two dipping sauces. \u00a0We then had the Prosciutto Tortellini with Marscarpone and Rosemary ($13) and the Herb Risotto with chanterelle mushrooms and crispy speck ($13). \u00a0Both of these were also excellent - the crispy speck really made the risotto a tasty treat. \u00a0They have an ample list of wines by the glass: \u00a0I had two glasses of Allegrini \"Palazzo della Torre\" ($13 each) and my wife had a glass of Vietti \"Tre Vigne\" Barbera ($12). \u00a0 For dessert we shared a special not listed on the menu (probably our only disappointment was the limited range of desserts on the printed menu, none of which caught our fancy). \u00a0I don't know the name or price of the dessert, but it was a delightful plate of small home-made sugar donuts - light, puffy and pillowy - with two different sweet dipping sauces. \u00a0I had a cup of decaf cappuccino which was delicious and presented very nicely. \u00a0Just as we finished dessert a text popped up on my cellphone that our table was ready and I told them it was no longer necessary. Total cost of the meal for two was around $155 to $160 (I had to toss in three bucks to cover shortfall in the gift cards.) \u00a0Valet parking price was $14 not including a tip to the valet. \u00a0The service was friendly and professional. \u00a0Given that we were among the older patrons in a very popular River North night spot, the bartender/waitress could have been cold and standoffish but she was very nice. \u00a0The atmosphere and d\u00e9cor is \"year 2013 cool\" - you get the sense that it is \"one of those places to be\" right about now. \u00a0Sleek modern design throughout. \u00a0 Loud conversation-challenging ambience. \u00a0Background music is not too loud, but seems to posses a regular continual bass-beat such as I recall from after-midnight Vegas clubs. \u00a0 Youngish crowd dressed in grays, blacks and whites but with the occasional bright orange watch-band. \u00a0A guy seated next to me at the bar asked the bartender \"what kind of cherry\" they were going to put in his cocktail.", "Date": "2013-12-04", "Author_Location": "Oak Park, IL"}, {"Author": "ellen p.", "ReviewID": "MFNewXqzIAP5HYzZe5zjMg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pleasantly surprised for a celebrity owned establishment.Delicious food (and I'm marrying into an Italian family, so I like to think we are a good judge of Italian fare).

As for the food portion of the night, we ordered a lot of smaller items so that we could try as much as possible since it was our first time in the restaurant. \u00a0The Zucchini Fritti was absolutely delicious; a great \"comfort food\" type snack. \u00a0 The Fresh Mozzarella Carrozza was also fantastic- my friend said they were the best thing he had ever eaten and he hates cheese! \u00a0We also ordered the Cremini Mushroom Pizzette; which was not quite as memorable. \u00a0They make all of their pastas in house and that was definitely apparent in Mama DePandi's Bacatini Pomodoro. \u00a0The noodles were hearty and the sauce was perfect for a huge tomato-fanatic such as me. \u00a0We ordered a side of Wood-Grilled Asparagus as well which I really enjoyed. \u00a0I absolutely recommend saving some room for one of their wonderful desserts! \u00a0We ordered the Hazelnut Tartufo; which is like a softball-sized Ferrero Rocher made of gelato (house-made as well)! \u00a0The shell was crispy and covered in hazelnut and the inside was rich, delicious gelato. \u00a0During our dinner, Viktor Stalberg and Jamal Mayars, who play for the Blackhawks came in for dinner after their game; which was very cool as well! \u00a0Our bill came out to $95; which is very reasonable!

The first impressions were very good and the space is beautiful with sleek white and black tones throughout (and I really like the server uniforms with white coats and black pants). The bar area is larger than I expected relative to the dining room but like Hub and Paris they have tables with the full menu too. It's no surprise that RPM will be another Melman hot spot in River North but there appears to be more of a focus on the dining experience and food.The menu is large with a ton of options in many categories. We tried something from the salad section (shaved brussel sprouts) and a starter from the cold antipasti section (fresh burrata). There's also a bread section, a pizzette section, a hot anitpasti section and a wood oven section. Yes, all of that just for \"starters\" with lots of choices. The next part of the menu is house-made pasta and risotto. Our server explained that each plate is relative small and shareable and not meant to be an entree. We tired the pesto pasta and mushroom risotto and really liked both. There were other options in the section I would want to taste - definitely a highlight of the menu. Finally, after all the previous options there is the entree section with steaks & chops, fish, classics and sides. We were not in a steak mood so we tried the salmon with a side of asparagus. I appreciate that the salmon dish was simple and not a massive portion. It was well cooked and seasoned and a nice option. The asparagus was our least favorite dish. We finished with a delicious bowl of chocolate sorbetto.It's not totally fair to judge the food and experience from a pre-opening, complimentary meal. There's a lot of good things going on that I know RPM will be a great addition to the area. My biggest complaints are the easiest the fix - service and front of house. I dislike waiting for a table and even more so when you have a reservation. I was confused why we had to wait another 30 minutes after our reservation time at 9pm on an evening when the restaurant isn't open to the public. Also, our service was good but at times seemed absent - just inconsistent and can get better with practice and training. Lastly the pricing is what you expect for a hot new spot with names like Rancic and Melman. Our bill was $125 for 2.5 courses with one entree and one dessert and one drink each. Add another entree and two more drinks and that's not a cheap night out.

A little too soft of a meatball & not enough texture. The grilled giant prawns were sooooo delicious. It made me think of the giant prawns I had in Asia.

\u00a0The vibe of this place does not shout buzzer. \u00a0OMG. \u00a0BOO. \u00a0The pretentious hostess, the pretentious vibe, the sleek wood with pops of white. \u00a0Definitely not buzzer like. \u00a0Oh well. \u00a0After 20 or so mins we got seated in a half booth. \u00a0I have to say, I love me a good booth. \u00a0Our server was really the reason I had to give this place 3 stars. \u00a0He was so pretentious. \u00a0First of all, lets say, a good waiter doesnt spill water all over my menu when we first sit down. \u00a0If you are going to act like god's gift, you better deliver. \u00a0This guy definitely did not. \u00a0So the water was kind of annoying, but it just added to the annoyance of this guy. \u00a0I think he was more concerned with his hair than what we were saying. \u00a0Literally when we were ordering, he only got half of what we were saying. \u00a0We had ordered gnocchi that never came out and had to reorder it. \u00a0Same thing with dessert. \u00a0It was like, is anyone in there?

\u00a0Not really. \u00a0King Crab-this was probably my least favorite dish. \u00a0There was barely any crab. \u00a0It was flavorless. \u00a0Again, another great selection by the server. \u00a0I would definitely not recommend this.Cannoli-I have to admit, I am not a huge fan of cannoli, but this was really good. \u00a0Creamy, sweet, crunchy, not overpowering. \u00a0Budino-YUM! \u00a0I love the chocolate and caramel and salt. \u00a0It was heaven in a bowl!Overall, I think if we would have just ordered what we wanted and not listened to our server, we would have enjoyed it more. \u00a0I felt that most of the small plates were fantastic, most of the pasta was good, but nothing out of the ordinary, the desserts were fantastic, the vibe is pretentious with a Chili flair (BUZZER????). \u00a0The portions are small, however what do you expect??? \u00a0Its for sharing.I might go back, but it wouldnt be my first choice.", "Date": "2012-07-11", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Christine H.", "ReviewID": "1-2fsi5YA6Y-OIhiYotAOg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best new restaurants to hit Chicago in a long time.

Our group of three each picked a small plate to share - pasta puffs, zucchini friti and meatballs. Pasta puffs were forgettable; reminding me of Pirate's Booty from Trader Joe's. Zucchini were good and substantial; the accompanying sauce was flavorful but not overwhelming. Meatballs were great, the sauce was so good I wanted to suck it up with a straw. We split two dinners, the eggplant parmesan and the swordfish with capers. Both dishes were delicious. The fish was tender and flaky, it came with a lemon butter sauce. The eggplant parmesan was also good and came with more of that delicious sauce. We capped dinner with delicious cannoli that had a hint of orange in the filling. Mmm. **Since we were visiting from out of town and most likely won't be back any too soon, we went back two days later to get cannoli take out.

The entrees and a la carte and sides are $7. \u00a0 Steaks go up to $50, but most entrees were in the $20-$30 range. Overall, the food was good. Some things were excellent, some okay. \u00a0My biggest complaint is the portions. Very small. \u00a0The cremini and fontini pizette (small pizza) is a joke. It is only $7, but it is about 5\"-6\" across. \u00a0The pieces of pizza looked more like for a mouse than human.The duck agnoloti were excellent. You get 6 small dumplings for $12. \u00a0The lemon conch pasta was also excellent. The Tuna entree for around $28 was unbelievably small. \u00a0It was 4 pieces of thin tuna. \u00a0Looked more like an appetizer. It had a few leaves of lettuce on it and nothing else. \u00a0When it came out we all commented on how small it was.The tortufo for dessert is a ice cream ball with a chocolate center and the entire outside is coated in hazelnut chocolate. \u00a0That was very good. \u00a0To be honest, probably the best value on the menu. \u00a0The service was so-so. \u00a0 One item came out at the wrong time.

It is definitely the hot place to see and be seen, the hostess station was kind of a mess with too many hostesses vying for position it seemed, and no one seemed to be in charge. Ultimately we asked the bouncer and more or less seated ourselves in a high table in the bar. Th wait staff was very attentive so that was better. The atmosphere is dark and loud, DJ music is piped in to the bar as well as the dining area. This was late so maybe its different then earlier in the evening so not sure about that but my only thought is that I was at a club and not what I would want at dinner, but what is important is the food so on to the details.We went after a show and I was very hungry, my first surprise is that the menu was all about small portions, ok Italian small portions??? \u00a0Also the waiter told us this was intended to be shared small portions but I hate to say that the portions are small you really cant share this. Ok well let's get beyond that. We ordered the Brussels sprout salad, if you had the salad at Sunda you know how amazing that is. Ours came and was extremely salted, couldn't get beyond that so moved on to Gnocchi Alforno, it looked amazing on the small dish albeit 4 pieces of gnocchi on a dish really? Sadly it was flavorless and mushy not what you would expect, next we had the fettuccine with toasted pine nuts, do not remember the full name but I remember similar dishes at other Italian restaurants and they were delish, well sadly this dish had absolutely no flavor, no really none. lastly I tried the eggplant Parmesan, I have had eggplant and I wasn't sure what this was but the only think I tasted was the cheese that was overpowering. The wine selection was just ok. At the end of the day glad I was able to try it but definitely not about the food it's about the atmosphere and the place to be.

The food is essentially overpriced carbs and offers very little in terms of diversity in any one single dish. Luckily, I ordered the ricotta cheese and toast which came with free refills on the bread because there was so much cheese with the order. So I filled up on bread, essentially. While the bread was good, the cheese was nothing special and not very sweet, which was a huge disappointment because Divanti Enoteca's bread, ricotta, and honeycomb is my favorite dish at that restaurant and I would go anywhere that had something comparable. Overall, I see no real reason to come back here. Everyone raves about the Tartufo, but I did not think it was anything special. It tasted like the gelato version of a crunch bar. I would rather make brownies at home than pay $8 for that again.Food we ordered:Ricotta and Semolina Toast (3/5 primarily because of the portion alone)Truffle Garlic Bread (my favorite dish of the whole night; I am sad I did not order this instead of the Ricotta because I only had a small piece or two)- (4.5/5)Maine Lobster Ravioli (2.5/5)- this was a very bland dish, but I felt more justified getting it because I felt it having some protein, lobster at that, in it justified the price whereas a small bowl of pasta with some tomato sauce and basil was $10. There were only 5 small raviolis in this dish, which I knew going in, but I expected it to fill me up a lot more. I also expected much more lemon flavor.Spaghetti and Meatball (4/5) I did not personally try this dish, but it looked good, my friend enjoyed it, and she had enough to take home as leftovers.Tartufo (3/5)- Once again, this is more based on portion alone. My friend and I split this and there was plenty for the two of us. However, like I said, it tasted like a crunch bar version of ice cream to me. She thought it was better than that, but I was not impressed.Overall, there are way better restaurants you can go to in Chicago for the same price or even cheaper (and obviously more expensive).Our bill came to $59, before tip, for two people, with neither of us getting alcohol or a drink besides water. That is not too bad, but seeing as how I filled up mostly on bread, it was disappointing. I am a woman who always keeps tabs on my weight and I try to eat healthy, so if I am going to splurge on pasta, I want it to be a great pasta dish. I want a mix of flavors and various veggies and a protein. I really want some pizzazz in the sauce as well as the ingredients. RPM did not do it for me and it really was a waste of junk calories. Next time I want Italian, I will spring for the cab fare to Divanti Enoteca and enjoy really amazing Italian food, other non-traditional Italian options, and wine for the same price.", "Date": "2012-03-14", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "D.C.

So my boyfriend called roughly two weeks beforehand and managed to get a us a reservation at 7:30. When we arrived we were greeted by 3 hostesses and were seated right away to a table in the middle of the main dining area. Our server greeted us a few minutes later and explained the menu and the small portions. He told us about the special which was a Risotto with proscuitto imported from Italy, offered only for a limited time, is larger than the other plates, and said he loved. He then took our drink orders; I got the Classic Bellini and my boyfriend ordered the Long-faced Dove. Both of which were really good.We started with the Truffled Garlic Bread and needless to say we finished the whole thing. We then ordered Short Rib Pappardelle, the Wild Pacific Salmon, a side of Roasted Mushrooms and the Risotto special. We both thought all the food was really good except my boyfriend didn't care too much about the risotto. Regardless, we finished it all. My boyfriend ordered a Stella and 10 minutes later our server said, \"Did you not get your Corona? They were supposed to bring it. Don't worry \u00a0I won't charge you for it.\" So we didn't correct him because he it was nice he wasn't gonna charge it anyway.For dessert, we got the Tartufo and our server suggested the Roasted Michigan Grapes saying it's his favorite and is often overlooked/underrated. So we tried that as well and it did not disappoint. Overall, our server made good suggestions and the food was excellent but here was the downfall. When our server brought us our check, he never gave us a chance to look at it because he saw we had our card out and immediately took it and charged it. We didn't think anything of the bill until we walked out and actually felt we were overcharged because we then added up everything we got, took into account he probably still charged us for the Corona but still didn't how an extra $45 was charged. The only irrational explanations are if the Risotto special was like $60 or if tip was already included which was not the case because it wasn't included when I ate here before. Granted, we didn't ask how much the special was and it was probably our fault for not asking to look at the itemized receipt but that was because he made us believe he good server.

I'm still thinking about it a week later. Had it both in the meatball appetizer and mama's pasta (and dipped the arancini in it), but couldn't get enough- Meatballs: quality finely ground meat with a wonderful smooth texture - Arancini: these small fried risotto balls were the hit of the table. The hidden bit of prosciutto inside was a nice addition.- Short rib pappardelle: tender pieces of meat that didn't need sauce for flavor - Affogato: the hub's regular cap to any Italian meal was a bit different with a bottled chilled coffee. I thought it was root beer at first but a brilliant idea to ensure the ice cream lasts longer- Bill's budino: not sure what it was but sort of like a thick chocolate mousse with salted caramel and little cocoa nibs on top. I know there was talk on their show of changing it up, but I really liked it- Wines: decent selection by the glass with a great Italian mix- Cocktails: got a bellini and loved it--the peach was not too sweet and always love my bubbles :-)- Birthday dessert: mini ice cream cones were adorable and filled with 3 flavors: coconut, pistachio, and rice pudding. I love it when restaurants acknowledge a special event \u00a0- Gluten free menu: just noticed now they had one and a gf fettuccine--love that since I'm technically not supposed to have wheat.- Waiter: helpful and professional. He explained the meal format and portion sizes as well as gave wine recommendations when requested- Atmosphere: soft lighting and mood music in the background. White chairs and semi circle booths were unique and unexpected at an Italian spot. \u00a0Good sized space with almost half dedicated to the bar area.Lowlights- Burrata filled ravioli special: was so excited cause this cheese is on every Italian menu nowadays and we loved it since we first tried it at A16 years ago, \u00a0but I've never had it in a ravioli.

Food, atmosphere, and price are all on par. Went on a Tuesday night, made a reservation beforehand-we were sat right when we arrived (5-10 min early) with a great table (the place was very full). The waitress was friendly and gave us a lot of good tips about the menu. Yes, it is sort of a tapas-style-Italian (which to me was a little too reminiscent of Quartino) but the food was so amazing that we didn't mind. I see a lot of people talking about portion size--and here's the thing: the portions are SMALL but they're HEAVY. So what might look like a teeny tiny bit of pasta is actually stuffed with duck or cheese and prosciutto--very rich. Between two of us, we ordered two appetizers: the truffled garlic bread (just as good as everyone said it would be) and the fried zucchini (there was a LOT of zucchini in this order, and though the zucchini itself was a little bland, the sauce served on the side was amazing). For dinner, we had the Duck Agnolotti, the Prosciutto Pansotti, and the Mascarpone Polenta. The Agnolotti and and Polenta were good, but the Pansotti was f*cking amazing. We were dying to try that hazelnut dessert, but neither of us could eat any more food. Two glasses of wine (substantial pours) apiece, bill was $100.

They also have an extensive gluten-free menu, including pasta, which was a huge selling point for me since I can't eat gluten. Here's the rundown of what we had:First course: -Shaved Brussels sprout salad with avocado: I love Brussels sprouts and I love avocado. This was such a tasty and refreshing salad.-Prosciutto wrapped figs: Absolutely incredible.Second Course:-Carbonara w/ gluten-free fettucine: Oh my gosh. I've had many a carbonara in my day but WOW this was incredible. So flavorful. They top it with an egg yolk which adds an amazing creaminess to the whole dish.Third course: -Whole branzino: This was probably my favorite thing we ate. Whole branzino, with lemon and capers. It was UNbelievable. I had branzino recently at another restaurant and I could barely eat it because it just simply did not compare. The flavors they accomplished in this were crazy.Fourth course:-Bill's Chocolate Budino: I love budino, but this one was sooo tasty. Chocolate with salted caramel...mm.

However, shorty after sitting down much of those concerned dissolved quickly. Zack (Manager?) stopped by to say hello right after we seated and we immediately launched into fun conversation about the menu. After a moment alone with the menu he returned and said that he would order on behalf of us to make sure we had the best experience and indeed we did. We ended up having the kale salad, octopus, squid ink pasta with crab, the porterhouse steak, potatoes, asparagus, and prawn which was far too much food for us but it was exciting and fun. Our waiter, Tuari, confirmed that we really did eat the best of the menu and we were thrilled to take out leftovers home! If you are looking for one dish you CANNOT leave RPM without trying it is most obviously the octopus. It is inspired, delicious, surprising and without a doubt the most enjoyable dish we had. Tuari also went out of his way to find a bartender that made my boyfriends favorite drink and they did an excellent job of impressing his very particular tastes. I fancied the \"Long-Faced Dove\" off the cocktail menu.

My boyfriend had the \"Lobster Ravioli\" and received 5 pieces for $15.

We experienced many of the same issues noted in previous reviews. First of all, it is impossible to get a reservation at a reasonable hour, so we just walked in at 10 pm as recommended \u00a0by the hostess, were instructed to wait in the bar area and seated within 15-20 minutes. This is definitely not a family friendly restaurant (as parents of 3 teenagers who wanted to join us) on any level as the excessive (pretentious) modern sports bar presence dominates with multiple bar areas throughout the restaurant, in addition to the loud, incessant night club music which reveals a blatant bias towards the young, swinging, trendy set. The actual area devoted to dining is small (we estimated @100 people), hence the difficulty in securing reservations. The impersonal, cold black/white decor theme is extremely severe and flat; no color, no art work, no personality. Good lighting, however, which is hard to achieve & pale pleather seats, like being in a car (evoking the RPM moniker!). While this trend might go over well in NYC or LA, it does not bode well in Chicago. The predominantly 'cute' white male waitstaff are also an issue for Chicago. There seemed to be more of them than us 'diners' and they all paraded around in droves \u00a0with ear wires avoiding eye contact as if they were bored out fo their minds on the catwalk at Fashion Week in NYC! But, their unremarkable white blazer uniforms look cheap and unflattering. We also felt uncomfortable observing such a pervasive hierarchy with busboys noticeably in all black & from a different ethnic group. While our waiter was patiently obliging, we felt like we were disturbing him by asking for bread & we did wait for everything at a time when the restaurant was less busy / emptying out. That said, we ordered the lobster carpaccio, which was acceptable, but at 3 designer bites is molto overpriced; the spinach/kale salad and the grilled octopus, were unmemorable. The wild boar sausage pasta was very disappointing. This is not the wild boar pasta we know in Italy! Our waiter couldn't even name the accompanying pasta (it was radiatore or radiator pasta), the balance of textures/tastes is all wrong and the entire dish is too salty. Chef Doug needs to curb excessive use of salt and chile flakes, period! On the positive side, the prosecco is dry and delicious. The wafting smell of freshly baked, warm authentic country bread with olive oil is too good to resist, but you have to ask for it several time. We also enjoyed the desserts immensely. The hazelnut ice cream tartuffo is excellent as is the black coffee affogato.

I had high hopes for this restaurant but I was greatly disappointed with the food. We ordered: truffled garlic bread (good), zucchini fritti (good but very oily), Mama DePandi's Pomodoro (2 plates of it because they were tiny and the pasta was nothing special. Tasted like regular spaghetti with ragu sauce. So disappointed), Eggplant Parmesan (only dish we got worth praising), prime beef meatballs (terrible! ordered them and they came out cold but they do not taste good at all. The waitress was great and got us another order that was hot as it is suppose to be served, but was still not happy with the taste and did not even finish the small plate), and we also ordered a dish with corn but I do not remember the name of it and frankly it isn't even worth reviewing. My sister and brother-in-law said it was great the first time they came to RPM but they themselves were disappointed with how it tasted this time around. It has a nice atmosphere, staff, and I love that the kitchen is open pretty late (I think it closes at 10 pm maybe later). However, if you are rating RPM strictly based on flavor then it is lacking. There was 4 of us and although we ordered a lot, and we knew it was served tapas style, we left unsatisfied.

The first night was awesome, our server was on point, \u00a0the food was delish, \u00a0and we loved the fun upbeat atmosphere. It's definitely a place to come with a group of people or a fun date night. I would not put it in the romantic category because of the noise level and the overall vibe of the place. Since we were having a large party in a couple weeks we wanted to try a lot so we could make the best choices for our menu. Fritto Misto- was shockingly chewy but I just chalked that up to a random over cooking which I imagine is rare, Ricotta Semolina toast- is amazing (we had that for the party), Prime Beef Meatballs- are to die for- we chose that for the party as well (huge hit with friends), Imported cheeses- (good selection), Giuliana Salad- (a normal but tasty salad) perfect for the party, Mama Depand's Bucatini Pomodoro- I think is a must try (friends loved it), Strozzapreti- is good but wasn't a hit with friends (I'm a fan of arugula and pine nuts so..), Short Rib Pappardelle- meat lover friends thought it was good. We chose the Halibut and Filet for our night as well as the party night both cooked perfectly and above average, For sides we went with Kale & Pancetta and Potato Parmesan. Potatoes were an exceptional side. Then for dessert we had the Tartufo and Strawberry Carpaccio. We knew the Tartufo was amazing from trying it before hand but chose the Strawberry Carpaccio and again the party was very happy with both. As I said our server was amazing the first night but we were surprised when the event coordinator came over to chat but didn't comp even a dessert considering we were having a party of 15 coming in two weeks. We've had a decent amount of large party dinners recently and expected better customer service in that area. With that said it was fine and still would've given 5 stars. What took the star off was our server at the party. My husband was going to send an email but it was in May so I assume that's not happening. As guests were sitting down at the table we had several bottles of wine waiting to be poured, my husband just started to do it because it took so long for her to get started. She seemed completely flustered the entire night and not happy to be there. There was a point where the desserts got mixed up and she said very loudly to herself that he didn't order that talking about one of my guests. He did order it to be clear. We stayed late into the night ordering drinks and our server just took off. She gave our account over to someone else. I assume her shift ended which is totally fine but she didn't even come to let us know of the change or thank us. The new server just popped up. EVERYONE at the party noticed the service but the food I would say overshadowed it so it worked out. RPM truly has amazing food but has a few quirks to work out in the service department. To sum it up the decor, food, and atmosphere is fabulous and we'll for sure be going back. I would definitely make sure if we had another party there we wouldn't have the same server.", "Date": "2012-06-12", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Grant M.", "ReviewID": "AfjflbjeFggtnY3j2M0xHw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This restaurant is all decor and no substance.

Ok I get it, it's a hot spot so even though we had a reservation, we would still have to wait. Well, after 20 minutes of waiting, I went up and asked how much longer it would be, they said the group at our table had paid and they are just waiting for them to leave. Well, finally 40 minutes later the pager went off. The hostess apologized as she walked us to our table. As we were seated the manager came right over and apologized and said champagne and appetizers were on their way over. The champagne was good champagne and it made up for the wait and then 4 appetizers (Homemade Ricotta Toast, Zucchini Fritti, \u00a0Provolone Stuffed Peppers and and Arancini) were brought over. The appetizers were very much appreciated and were very good! They did not have to do that, usually restaurants will say there is nothing that they can do about the wait, that they are busy, but this place actually handles situations the right way and takes care of their customers.The wine and martinis were delicious! We enjoyed the lobster caprese, they didn't skimp on the lobster. The meatballs were tasty. The Tuna Carpaccio was very fresh and yummy. The wood oven gnocchi al forno was so light and fluffy, I have never had gnocchi like this before, it was very different good. The Spicy King Crab Pasta was delicious, not too spicy, just a little kick and again they didn't skimp on the crab.

The ricotta was so smooth and creamy and went perfectly with the warm, chewy bread. My husband had the Sicilian Pork Arrosti, which both of us tried. It was so tender. They served it with beans (which usually I'm not a fan of) but these beans were so flavorful and creamy that it made a believer out of me! I had the Prosciutto Pansotti. What a treat! It packs a punch in those tiny packages. The only thing was, the pasta was not fully cooked. Some of it still felt hard. We had the roasted muchrooms and the polenta for sides. I have never had polenta before, and that was a revelation! I ended up wanting more olive oil on it as that gave it the extra kick it needed. For dessert, my husband had Bill's Chocolate Budino. It had a salty caramel with salty Cocoa Nibs on top. Normally, salt is my husband's favortie ingredient, but this was too salty even for him.

Then we split a Caesar salad without the anchovies and followed it by the calamari which was amazing. We each had different pasta dishes and by the time we were 1/2 way, we were too stuffed to try any dessert. Loved it from start to finish.

Perhaps the long wait made me anticipate this like an Alinea reservation. Of course it's not in the same class, but the wait and the initial reviews had me excited for my reservation and I really wanted to like this restaurant.. It is average to good. Truffled garlic bread was OK, much better dipped in the extra pomodoro sauce my husband asked for with his lobster ravioli. Lobster Caprese appetizer was fabulous and the highlight of the meal. Giuliana's Italian salad was pretty good, but a little heavy handed on the dressing and a bit soggy. Mama DePandi's Bucatini was nice, fresh, and flavorful but our filet was burnt to a crisp. It must have been the victim of a flare up because it was done perfectly medium rare on the inside but completely charred on the outside. And it was not a char crust seasoning--just plain ole burned. The singed filet took RPM from three to two stars. Bill's Budino dessert was a bit dense but OK. Wine list was not particularly vast or impressive. Affable and competent service, but we were left wanting for more. There is definitely room for improvement, and the restaurant management should not misinterpret robust sales as approval. At this point, it's a lot of tourists and peeps hoping to catch a glimpse of our hometown celebs (guilty as charged). \u00a0I suspect one and done curiousity seekers but not serious foodies that are keeping this place hopping.

My husband made the reservations approximately a month ago, and at the time he made them, the only availability for a party of 4 was 5:00pm and 10:30pm, so we went for 5:00pm. As it was a birthday celebration, there was no way I was staying sober enough for a nice restaurant 'til 10:30We arrived a few minutes late and were seated immediately. \u00a0The decor is upscale, but simple and clean, not over powering or obnoxious, and not traditional \"Italian restaurant\" decor. \u00a0Our waitor was Bobby (per the receipt, I don't remember if that is what he introduced himself as) and he was very good. \u00a0He was very friendly, patient with all of our questions, explained the menu thuroughly, and made a lot of good suggestions. He even took note of the comment my husband had made when he placed the reservation, and he wished me and my friend a happy birthday. \u00a0I had read all the good reviews about the truffled garlic bread here on Yelp, so we ordered that immediately. \u00a0It was amazing like all the previous reviewers stated. It was enough for the 4 of us to share as an app. We then ordered the small plates of the provolone stuffed peppers, the polenta poached egg, and a fennel dish, can't remember what it was called. \u00a0Everything was great, but the provolone stuffed peppers were the stand out. When you go keep in mind that these small plates are very small. \u00a0You will want to order more than one item if you are sharing. \u00a0For entrees I had the eggplant parmesan, my husband and friend each had the big eye tuna, and my friend's husband had the lamb. We all thought our food was really good. \u00a0Only complaint about these disheas was that the big eye tuna is definitely not cheap, and it is also definitely not anything I would call an entree. \u00a0If you order this, get a side or two, the tuna alone will not be enough to serve as a meal. For dessert we ordered the hazelnut ice cream chocolate ball thing, I'm not sure what this was called, but the four of us shared it and all thought it was amazing. Bobby told us it was on the house, and before he brought that out, he brought me and my friend a plate of teeny tiny ice cream cones with birthday candles. \u00a0Very cute. For beverages the men had draft beer, and I believe there were quite a few options for them to choose from. \u00a0My friend and I shared a bottle of Reisling that was very good. Expect to pay quite a bit for the wine. I would give 4.5 stars if I could, based on taste and quality of the food, our awesome waitor, and the fact that our desert was on the house and they were nice enough to take note of our birthdays. Why I'm not giving 5 stars: \u00a0We tried to add one person the week before the reservation, to make it a party of 5, and we were told that was only available at midnight. Obviously we didn't do that. \u00a0 We got there at 5:00 and there were probably a good 15-20 empty seats in our area, at several tables. \u00a0Most of these stayed empty for at least an hour, and for the entire time we were there, there were 8 empty seats right next to our table! \u00a0Yes, maybe there was a last minute cancellation, but I doubt it as there were several empty tables. Another reason for not giving 5 stars is the skimpiness of the tuna dish, and the fact that the expensive entrees do not come with any sides or salads, that is all at an additional cost.", "Date": "2012-04-22", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sarah A.", "ReviewID": "mhFh9s_pBQShvOT6Fw2mww", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The decor is awesome.

The spinach pasta was different, but very tasty, and the lobster was fresh and very enjoyable. My wife enjoyed the carbonara as well, and with how rich their pastas are, the portions were the perfect size. We split Bill's chocolate bundino for dessert, although it really consisted of my wife having 4-5 spoonfuls and me wolfing the rest down.

Our friends had the Giuliana Salad and Spaghetti and Meatball and said it was the best pasta and meatball - better than Rosebud she told me! Our other friend had the risotto and his plate was clean...a pretty good sign it was delicious! Now, for dessert...again, my husband and I couldn't partake, but our friends had the Chocolate Sorbetti and Bill's Salted Caramel dish...the looks on their faces were of pure indulgence, so I can only assume they were, in Giuliana's words \"Amaze-Balls!\" We'll definitely be back and highly recommend for all you Chicagoans and visitors, too!", "Date": "2013-02-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mark T.", "ReviewID": "cxvJDr5vNoo4bZrjyJuC9g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went here with a group of friends to give it a try. \u00a0I'm not huge on \"scene\" places, and this place is a bit of a scene. \u00a0But, if you can get by that, the food was really tasty and our waiter was great. \u00a0If you are looking for large portions at small prices, don't go here. \u00a0If you are ok spending a few bucks and want to try a bunch of different small items, this is a good place to do so. \u00a0We started with the charred pepperoni tomato pizza, the roman style artichokes, and the zucchini. \u00a0All were very tasty. \u00a0For the main meal, I had the arugula salad (ok-not great), the corn agnolotti (really good, I was debating on this or the lobster and was glad I went with the corn dish-waiters advise-who knew corn could be so good). \u00a0For dinner, I split the white fish special (the exact name of the fish escapes me) and that was delicious as well. \u00a0For dessert, we all split the tartufo (I thought was just ok-but other at the table loved it), the Bills Chocolate Budino (my favorite- if you love chocolate, caramel, and sea salt you will love this), and the waiter brought us Vanilla/Pestachio Gelato on the house (also very tasty). \u00a0All in all, this was a great meal. \u00a0A bit pricey, but a great meal all the way.", "Date": "2012-08-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Megan R.", "ReviewID": "UJcKTPghaF8BB-YvMtkHPw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Good, that's about it.. \u00a0My bf and I love G and B so we were excited to finally try the much talked about restaurant. Went with reservations on a Staurday night. We got there on time and was seated promptly. First noticed that this is very very trendy, but people were dressed all over the place. My husband was in jeans,he felt under dressed, but he was fine, the younger gals were mos def dressed to impress. Our waiter was very well versed in the menu and cocktail list. The wine let was easy to decipher and very well priced. \u00a0Started with meatballs, octopus and lobster caprese. All was fine, nothing amazing. Also shared the Italian salad and arugula salad, again, both good. \u00a0Dinner entrees included the filet, cooked perfectly and very tender. I was surprised how good it was, probably the best entree we had, Also had \u00a0mushroom risotto and chicken and peppers. Nobody was thrilled with those. My highlight was dessert. The turtuffo was amazing! Chocolate gelatto rolled in hazelnuts covered in chocolate shell, did not disappoint. Overall it was fine but for about $375 for 4 people (3 drinking) there are better places in the city. \u00a0I would have also liked to see more mama Depandi in this place since she was the Inspuration. Too bad Bill got caught up in the money, I think a small delicious place (think Lucia's in Wicker Park) would have done great. There are some kinks to be worked out. The runners seemed confused on table numbers.

After dining here I have to admit it wasn't my favorite Italian restuarant. The garlic/butter bread was amazing, the cheese platter was good and the dessert truffle was pretty good as well. The one thing I did not care for was my entree (chicken and peppers) or the parmesan potatoes. My boyfriend tried the filet and spegetti with ink suace and really enjoyed that. Our server was very on top of everything however, the host/hostess coul have been a little more pleasent. I understand she(and he) were dealing with a big crowd of hungry people but greeting people a little more polielty goes a long way. If you want a traditional Italian expereince I think there are other restarurants that can give you that experience with authentic food. If you are looking for a trendy/modern Italian place with decent food and moderate (pretty good considering the other restaurants in the area) then give RPM a try.
