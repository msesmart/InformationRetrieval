I mean...hot chocolate. What more is there to say?A lot actually. Mindy's Hot Chocolate is more than just hot chocolate. Yes, this place has amazing chocolately goodness, but the food is fantastic as well! I ordered the shrimp and grits for brunch and DEVOURED it. I would come back to Mindy's exclusively for the shrimp and grits, they were that delicious. I also tried the pancake, which is literally a pan-cake. A fluffy cake baked in a can, served with strawberries. It's unique and very tasty. My mom was really obsessed with it. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the brunch farmer's market salad. There was something about the quinoa and dressing that was a bit off to me, but I woudn't call it bad.But back to the namesake...I was with a group of 13, so I tried most of the hot chocolates. They were all delicious, but my favorite was definitely the Medium. The dark chocolate really stole my heart in the Medium, but the milk chocolate in it kept it just sweet enough. For a slightly lighter option (hah who am i kidding?), try the Half and Half. The espresso makes it more like an affogato than a cup of pure chocolate.The conclusion: Definitely worth every calorie.", "Date": "2014-07-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Lauren D.", "ReviewID": "0yznGiysJ9w4J0TyamcWdA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not ashamed to say that I was so eager to try this place that I came here by myself.And the embarrassing moment that ensued after my waiter asked who would be joining me was well worth it.The atmosphere alone at Hot Chocolate is worth a trip. Always dimly lit and very inviting and cozy. It didn't seem to get too loud despite being quite full.I'd heard the burger was top-notch, so I followed orders and am very glad that I did. The care that goes into this dish is amazing. House-fried potato chips, homemade pickles and slaw. All the ingredients are fresh and intentional. Upon my second visit with a friend, we opted for an appetizer of the soft pretzel. The $12 price tag made me raise my eyebrows, but they brought us two, and I could have eaten both of them. They came with a divine cheese spread that I'd recommend putting on anything and everything.For my meal, I went with another sandwich, the lamb and creama kasa. It's a hefty sandwich and quite rich so be prepared to either take some home or leave feeling very...heavy.To end this review, I will leave you with three words: Mexican hot chocolate. Liquid bliss. And a homemade marshmallow to top it off. The hint of spicy cinnamon sent it over the top.I'll be back again soon to see what else they're doing amazingly well.", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sue L.", "ReviewID": "GCjs16zY7nWU1_S-3zgGeA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Dropped in on a Saturday night and got lucky!

Came here for a mid-afternoon pre-dinner snack during my Chicago trip for some appetizers and a cup of hot chocolate. This restaurant is classy with a great selection of drinks and sweets. We split a grilled squid panzanella salad which we were pretty disappointed with. The seasoning was way off and the salt content was off the charts, the squid itself did not have a pleasing texture and a bit too much char for my taste.Now onto that chocolate... I ordered the black & tan - which is part fudge and part medium hot chocolate. If you are a dark chocolate lover who also loves hot fudge sundaes you will love how rich and delectable this hot chocolate is. I ended up not mixing in all of the hot fudge in effort to save my mouth from being too rich in chocolate.

Cool interior, great food, yummy cocktails, perfect hot chocolate(s), great staff. If you follow my reviews you know it's always a challenge to find a \"dad approved place to eat\" for those familial visits from the #1 pickiest eater. I imagine payback for my own picky eating as a kid. I wanted a birthday lunch I could enjoy and one that didn't involve complaining from the parental unit. Mindy's is a great option! I wanted a fancy cocktail and was told they didn't serve them for lunch, but the super duper kind waiter made me one because it was my birthday! Yay! We ordered hamburgers all around and they were a BIG hit! They are served with homemade chips, homemade pickles and tiny little bottles of ketchup and mustard for each plate. I heart condiments and especially ones that come in tiny bottles. My dad declared, are you ready for it? He said, \"this is the best cheeseburger I have ever had in my life.\" There you have it! The hot chocolate, especially the Mexican hot chocolate, is to die for. With a big, plump marshmallow on top. Sadly they were revamping the dessert menu the couple of times I was there and they weren't serving the doughnuts I had heard so much about. Boo. Top notch food. Great cocktails.

So it pains me to write this, really. I've had great food here, both dessert and non-dessert. One off-day is one thing, but when the food and service have been inconsistent your last several visits, you start wondering what's going on, especially when it's this restaurant of this caliber.I don't know if it's because there's new people in the kitchen, or if it's because Mindy Segal is investing all her time opening her new place in Logan Square or what. I've had really great dishes (chilled pea soup), and really meh dishes. Particularly this last time we went for brunch, we ordered the brunch fried rice and the veggie scramble. Although the ingredients are always top-notch and sourced locally, the execution was seriously lacking from what you'd expect from this accoladed restaurant. I'm playing the Top Chef card and calling out their lack of salt (this coming from a girl who usually complains of too much salt). When I'm paying $13 for a scramble, I expect it to be seasoned well and not be oozing liquid because the veggies weren't prepared correctly, ya know?Food service has also been slow, in that it took a really long time for our entrees to come out. On more than one occasion. However, customer service is their saving grace and luckily this last time, our server was kind enough to comp us a couple things off our bill. I always appreciate it when restaurants do that, and it keeps me coming back even when I have a mediocre experience.Hot Chocolate, step your game back up, you've got a reputation to keep up!", "Date": "2014-06-23", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Meredith K.", "ReviewID": "QdXO-g3QYsg92XoCxbHVoA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We made reservations well in advance to finally use my open table gift card from Christmas.

What really sold me on Mindy's the first time - in addition to the super cute decor and overall ambiance of the restaurant - was the mussels! The mussels and croquettes were to. die. for. and I was hoping that we'd be able to order them this time around.Unfortunately, they didn't have the mussels this time of year, so we ended up trying a few new things on the menu: the shrimp louie salad and the crab cake sandwich. Both were outstanding choices, and perfectly portioned to share. I would definitely recommend both options - depending on whether you are looking for a healthier, lighter option, or a heavier, more filling option.We also tried the half&half hot chocolate (because I really needed that extra shot of espresso to tide me through the last leg of our road trip), which was a truly delightful way to sum up our late afternoon lunch. The hot chocolate is extremely rich, so unless you are a true chocolate fanatic, I would suggest you share with a friend. Although they do state that they charge a 'split' fee, we weren't charged the extra $1.Although the restaurant and the menu itself are worthy of five stars, I found our waitress unfriendly and almost cold at times. She was definitely in the minority though, as I found the hostess and other staff members to be very personable. She didn't seem to take any particular interest in our table and treated us almost as if we were a burden to her. Call me overly sensitive, but I definitely got the feeling she only came over to check up on us because she was obliged.

I'm also happy that I was able to come while Mindy was still the pastry chef--change is coming soon!I came around 9:30 with my mommy after dinner and even though it was 30 minutes before close, they were so nice about seating us. There were three other parties there in addition to the two of us that looked like they had also just been seated. We were given the dessert menu and we had such trouble deciding what to order as everything looked so delicious.We indulged ourselves and ordered the Spring Strawberries (roasted California strawberries, strawberry lambic cake, strawberry preserve frozen yogurt, lemon \"squares\"), the ice cream and sorbet (coffee cocoa nib, rhubarb ros\u00e9 sorbet, and champaign mango), and the medium hot chocolate (milk chocolate with a touch of dark chocolate and a hint of caramel).The hot chocolate came out first and it was so decadent. I like my hot chocolate a little less rich but I happily shared this with my mommy. The marshmallow though is what I had really been wanting to taste and it was everything I expected. A little crunchy but gave just enough. And so so so so so delicious. Not too sweet. Or maybe it was but the hot chocolate was so sweet it didn't taste that sweet. HEH.The Spring Strawberries was SO good. The lambic cake was so, so, so delicious and the strawberry flavor came out so strongly which you often don't get. The lemon \"square\" was tart enough but also sweet enough. It had a slight crunchy top but so soft underneath.Lastly, the ice cream and sorbets. The potent flavor of the strawberry dish carried over to the flavors of the ice cream and sorbets. Each and every single one of the flavors we ordered were on point and so flavorful. The rhubarb was my least favorite--I always forget I am not particularly partial to rhubarb but it was by far the best rhubarb flavored thing I've had since coming back from France where my host mom used to make me fresh rhubarb jam. HEH. The coffee flavor was so potent that I actually couldn't eat too many bites as I'm not a lover of coffee. My mom, though, had no problem finishing it by herself. The champagne mango stole the show for me. It actually tasted like they had taken the a mango and magically turned it into a cold and creamy substance served in a petite bowl. IT TASTED LIKE I WAS EATING A MANGO. UGH. I can taste it still as I write about it and my taste buds are dancing.By the time we were finished, it was a little past 10 but no one in the restaurant was in a hurry to kick us out which was SO nice of them. We were the first to leave of the other three parties but it didn't seem as if they were being rushed either--in fact the servers and manager were all so pleasant, taking care to make sure that all of our needs and theirs were being met.Honestly, this experience was so positive that I'll forgive that we paid $35 for such small desserts.

I was uber excited....sadly my excitement was short lived.The Good- Hot Chocolate (medium) was amazing and the big marshmallow that comes with it was a great touch. My dining companion has the Pumpkin Hot Chocolate and loved it.- Sea Scallops: my dining companion had these and said the dish was good. Seeing how I wasn't offered a taste I can't give my input (tears).The OK- Pretzel: we got the pretzels as an appetizer and they were delicious. Warm and soft with just the right amount of salt. The cheese dipping sauce was just OK.- Apple brioche bread pudding: I love bread pudding and from reading the description on the menu I thought this was going to be AMAZING. Turns out it was just OK. I found myself wishing I had gotten a second cup of hot chocolate instead of the dessert.The Bad- Duck breast: I got the Duck breast as my entree and I was disappointed. It was dry and chewy. This dish would have been much better if there was some type of sauce on the duck or even on the side.The Ugly- Service: I hate to be mean, but the service we received ranks in the top 5 of \"what the hell\" service I've experience during my years of living in Chicago. The waiter tended to hover over us when we first hot seated wanting us to place our orders before we had sufficient time to review the menu.

It got really ugly when he brought us the dessert menu and wanted to know if we wanted anything, we had inform him that we had yet to receive our entrees. He looked confused and then embarrassed.

I don't eat many of burgers in my life, but when I do, I want them to be amazing, This is definitely a place I will think of when I decide to get my next burger. It will absolutely be ordered to-go, though. Again, I'll get to that later. The final positive was the cake squared and shake dessert that we got. Great taste, perfect portions for such a rich dish, and a good sampling of multiple different treats. They also wrote a nice \"happy birthday\" message on the plate for my friend. Super sweet! =)Now for the negatives. Oh, the negatives. Our server was terrible. Seriously - one of the worst I've ever had. To be fair, I know that I can be quite annoying as a diner with all of my questions. Honestly, though, I'm not a b**** about my questions. I'm genuinely interested in knowing about many dishes - even the ones I don't want to order. Sorry, it's kind of part of your job to answer questions. Also, yes, I want my salad dressing on the side. Always. Sorry if that offends you or the chef or your mother...but it's personal preference and not that hard of a request to fulfill. I will give just one example of the snark we endured the whole night. I asked about the carrot and ginger soup and if it was \"creamy\" (mind you, this is probably my fifth question in the whole time we're ordering...I know...annoying to some). He responded \"well, it's vegan, so it couldn't have cream, now could it?\" My friends and I sat stunned. He smirked, said \"cheers\" (for the first of 17 times that night) and walked away. OK. I was a server for years and that never would have been stood for. Maybe pretentious Wicker Park establishments are different, but I would hope not. I wish I could remember this server's name, but I can't. Bald man...that's all I know. Last negative was the price. I alluded to this before - I don't think that the quality of food in the portions we were served warranted the price tag. Just my opinion, though.

What?! This must be a yelp error, how could I have never written a review to one of my favorite Chicago restaurants that I've been to at least a half a dozen times already. Must have been all that amazing hot chocolate that goes to my head. Where do I begin?! The place is super adorable, perfect for a date night, perfect for a girls night out, perfect to grab something for yourself individually to go, it's pretty perfect all around. I just love the atmosphere, but mostly I'd recommend it for a nice date night with one of those cute tables with a rounded mirror behind you. They do have a nice like 8-10 people semi private table in the back which I have reserved in the past for a private all girl birthday brunch which I loved since it was not nearly as loud as everywhere else. In fact, that's the only reason they don't get the full 5 stars, is that it's almost always a little overly noisy for me which could kinda ruin that perfect date night atmosphere, but their hot chocolate will NOT stop me from coming back. Okay, so the atmosphere is super adorable, now onto their service. I've never had bad service here, never a mistake, everything brought out in a timely manner and always good recommendations from the servers, definitely an A+ there. Now onto the food, which I don't know where to start, anything from my favorite brunch buttermilk pancake that's the size of the plate topped with seasonal fruits (and yes, I can finish it all by myself) to their amazing burger that's both on the brunch and dinner menu that is served with house made chips and adorable mini sized ketchup and mustard, (total cuteness factor right there) to their amazing mussels that my husband says is the best he's ever had. I've never had a bad dish there and those are just their entrees. Let's get into the important category, their incredible desserts. Once again, never had anything I didn't like, and they constantly change minus their little donuts, and they always have seasonal items and if it's your birthday or other special occasion they will definitely decorate it to the t. There's something about Mindy's Hot Chocolate that makes you feel special, every time I go here. Literally try any of their desserts and although nothing is super cheap here, it is worth every penny because you can tell that they put in a lot of effort and creativity into their work.Last but not least, the whole point of coming here is to try their hot chocolate, I've gotten all my girls hooked onto this part. My personal favorite is the medium hot chocolate (that can be made iced) with their ridiculous (in a good way) home made marshmallow. I could eat a whole bag of those if they supplied them, you will never look at another marshmallow the same way again. But once again, all their hot chocolates whether dark or mexican or half and half, are all amazing! Truly the best in Chicago. I know for a to go option they can even split the hot chocolate for you as a sharing option if having a whole cup to yourself is too decadent for you. But let's be real here, when I come here, there's no sharing, it's all about me and that Chocolate.

The fact that you can make reservations for dessert only is a pretty clear indicator of the place they want to occupy, and they attack desserts with relish, but it never achieved the mythical status that is so frequently suggested.These are some of the heaviest desserts I've ever sampled. Good heavy. But like a good weight lifter, make sure you stretch and warm up before hand. I've had the dark chocolate hot chocolate, the chai hot chocolate, the cookie plate, and the carrot cake. The hot chocolates are work. They're large 16 oz cups of impeccable quality chocolate and heavy cream. Despite how good it is, the richness means that half a cup leaves one more than filled. These were truly unique and brilliant desserts unto themselves; I only wish they offered some sort of Hot Chocolate flight to sample them all. The other desserts were good but didn't stimulate the senses as the hot chocolates did. They're exceptionally well plated, and quite good tasting, but lack the knock-out punch of the hot chocolates.Service is excellent.

You'd think with 8 dollar hot chocolates that they could afford to power the lighting in this place.My date and I shared 3 starters. The menu is constantly changing so these options might not be available to you when you visit:- Foie Gras Mousse - I've had a bad experience with foie gras before so I was hesitant to try it. However, their mousse had great flavor without having the too-soft-almost-oily texture I had in my previous foie gras adventure- Mac and Cheese - Really? That was it? People hyped up the mac and cheese a big too much for me so I was left disappointed. Not only that, I'm not really a big fan of mac and cheese so I think it's even harder to impress me.- Scallops - Best part of the night, in my opinion. The scallop was perfectly cooked with a little bit of carmelization on the outside but oh so soft on the inside. It was served over something that felt like a corn risotto and the pesto+bacon bits+greens made for a perfect bite.Afterwards, we ended up ordering way too much dessert. We each got a hot chocolate (which has the best marshmallow I've ever had. Seriously. It's almost like the marshmallow is in a state between marshmallow and powder so it dissolves super quick but not too quick. Just check it out), a chocolate cake with chocolate cake ice cream and chocolate mousse, and cocoa nib ice cream.

Ordered dessert and 2 glasses of the same wine. Our dessert came out first before our wine , which was a little weird. The wine came about 10 minutes later...3. A person, who was not the server, served us the wine... in two very small glasses. He explained that they didn't have enough wine to give us 2 full glasses, so they split the glass of wine in half and served us each half so (and I quote) \"which you guys are winning because we're only charging you for one glass\"Okay, let's pause here for a second. First, we ordered 2 glasses of wine, not 1. Second, why the hell didn't you offer us another option (i.e. \"oh, we're out of this wine, did you want to order another glass... here, I suggest this kind of wine, it's very similar...). Third, don't tell me what to think. Fourth, we're not winning, you're literally serving us less than we ordered. Fifth, don't tell the customer that they are winning when they are quite clearly not. Sixth, WHY THE HELL DO WE HAVE TO SPLIT ONE GLASS OF WINE? (Okay, so I like my wine).4. When we were finished, the server came to ask us how the dessert was and to give us the bill. I said I was disappointed we were forced to share a glass of wine. She said \"well I'm not stopping you from ordering more.\"Okay, let's pause again. We would have spent a lot more money on our bill had you have the courtesy to ask. I'm not asking for our meal to be free or anything... but if there is an inconvenience - you make it right!

I have been going to Hot Chocolate for years...way back when you didn't have to wait 45 minutes for a table to get some of their delicious hot chocolate. But, ever since Mindy Segal won the James Beard Award, they have stopped caring about their long-standing customers. We made reservations on Saturday night at 9:30 for dessert while my mom was in town. She had never been and I was so excited to have her try their hot chocolate. We arrived a few minutes early, but still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table. Ok, it's a Saturday night, it happens. No harm done there, except the hostess said to us, 'Yeah we have a couple of stragglers that just will not leave...\" Which I thought was a but unprofessional to say to a guest. We sat down intending to order hot chocolate and desserts. We ordered our hot chocolate and needed a few more minutes to pick a dessert, which the waiter seemed incredibly annoyed with. A runner brought our hot chocolates and we were ignored until they were halfway gone. At that point, we were no longer in the mood for dessert. Our waiter finally came over and asked about dessert and we told him we were ready for our check. Mind you we had been seated for maybe 15 minutes at this point. He walked away and came back to inform us that since we had a reservation, there was a $15 minimum per person (there were 3 of us, so $45 total). He mentioned that it was listed on the web site and Open Table, which we missed. Obviously, our fault and we asked for a few minutes to pick something with the intention of just bringing it home to eat the next day. Again...we were ignored for about 10 minutes. He finally came over to take our order, but before we could even get the words, 'but, could we have that to go?\" he ran off. So, when the aforementioned hostess walked by, we stopped her and explained that we would like to have the order to go. She immediately snapped, 'We don't do to go.\" Um, what? Are patrons just forced to eat everything they order or leave it behind? That was the oddest (and rudest) response I have ever heard. It seems to me that Hot Chocolate is trying to move away from what made them popular in the first place and start to push patrons toward dinner and drinks, of which, I am sure are the real money makers. A suggestion - maybe change your name so those of us that are coming in for dessert aren't met with a rude surprise.

All were very good to excellent. I especially adore the salted caramel ice cream that comes with the chocolate souffled tart. Mindy Segal needs to open an ice cream-only parlor. She definitely has the chops.The reason that Hot Chocolate is getting 4 and not 5 stars from me is because I am so tough on dessert. The first time I ordered the chocolate souffled tart it came just slightly overcooked. Luckily it still came together with the ice cream and caramel sauce to provide moisture, and it was cooked perfectly on my next visit. However, on that visit it was a 4 star dessert.

I've had gourmet mac & cheese before but nothing has tasted like THAT. I really can't figure out how they make it taste so much better, but they have it mastered. It was so gooey, but not in a watery way. We started making jokes about how we were going to move down the street and order it carry out every single day. It was 'moving down the street' good.My husband ordered the burger with an added egg (add $2) The presentation was lovely, with its side of cole slaw and a mini bottle of ketchup and mustard -- but this burger was so much more lovely than just it's appearance. It was phenomenal. The burger was juicy (although it was a little too pink for me) and melted in your mouth. I thought the mac & cheese was better, but this was still extremely good.I really wanted dessert but found out that they only serve dessert with dinner, although you can order some donuts or pastries during \"brunch.\" I skipped that but I did get to try their chai.

The Mac and cheese is big enough to be eaten as an entree and it was very rich and cheesy just the way it should be. The pretzels were okay the cheese dipping sauce could have had just a little more kick in it and it would have been perfect.Entree: I had the burger cooked medium with an over easy egg on top. The burger was HUGE, epic proportions. It was filling and the side of chips were perfect.Dessert: Ordered a mint hot chocolate to share. It was extremely minty and rich. A little too rich for my liking. The marshmallow adds to the sweetness of the whole drink so I wouldn't have added it in if I had known.Had a slice of blueberry pie (different name on the menu) and it came with a scoop of ice cream.

And not in a good way.Having not been to this establishment in several years, my husband and friend thought Hot Chocolate sounded like the perfect whipped-cream ending to a night of eating Mexican food and drinking red wine. What better way to warm the heart and soul on a cold Chicago Saturday night?Oh, there are better ways. \u00a0We stood at the restaurant's hostess stand waiting to be acknowledged but the two women were far too busy with something on the touchscreen that had induced a hipster giggle fit. \u00a0They had that I'm-in-a-bubble-no-one-can-see-me attitude that told me I was not soon to be helped. \u00a0So I blew by them, headed to the bar.I spotted an empty bar seat, claimed it, gestured to the two guys and they came over to order a drink.What happened next was puzzling and a little amusing. \u00a0My friend ordered a glass of pinot noir, and when the bartender (who was strangely dressed like a scullery maid of some sort) cited two choices, my friend asked which is lighter. \u00a0She poured a taste and tossed it into her own gullet.This one, she said.My friend asked if perhaps HE could try it (imagine!) and she complied. He made a choice - the one she said was from Oregon's \"Wilmette\" Valley (I guess some peoples' worlds do not extend beyond the north shore, even if they work at a place that charges $14.00 a glass). I will save you the suspense and mention now that we never ate any dessert. \u00a0The bartender, after serving the drinks, turned her head slightly and narrowed her eyes, inquiring, are you waiting for a table? \u00a0No, I said. Fair question, but why the snark, I wondered.My friend then approached the two gals at the hostess desk to ask about a table and they said it was a 90-minute wait and that his friend (me) was NOT supposed to be sitting at the bar, those spaces are RESERVED. \u00a0Ah. \u00a0The attitude was starting to make sense.We laughed a little, I mean, it's one seat and the two guys were standing, what's the big deal, they were making $40+ in about 30 minutes off of us, in about 4 square feet of space. \u00a0We would have spent more but it wasn't long before a waiter stopped by and asked my husband if we would like to get a table.OK, we get it. \u00a0You don't want us at the bar. \u00a0You want us to chug our thimble-sized, overpriced, charmingly-named drinks and get out. Hubs made it clear to the waiter that all the employees' rudeness was duly noted and that we were headed for the door soon.So.....as we finished up, a parade of waiters, hostesses and other employees made it their business to pass behind us with large items of various kinds, with the accompanying loud EXCUSE MEs and COMING THROUGHs. \u00a0This urgent need for chairs, trays and plates at the front of the room came on suddenly, as if an emergency meeting was called in the kitchen. Code BLUE - get these people out of here before they encourage others to.....gulp...STAND at the bar!So we paid and left. Note to Hot Chocolate: \u00a0if you are going to go all pretentious and high-falutin', you will need to train your front staff to filter the STANDERS before they reach the bar. They can swipe left on Tinder some other time. \u00a0 And maybe you should do a quick recap of wine-producing regions for the bar staff. \u00a0Oregon's Willamette Valley growers will thank you for not mistaking their rich, loamy perfect-for-pinot soil for Wilmette's sandy, toxic landfill.", "Date": "2014-02-24", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Alfred L.", "ReviewID": "Gw4GWs9qR359gjZfkU5MDg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Wicker park is the hipster neighborhood of Chicago so we fittingly decided to eat at a hipster joint.

It was rich from the foi gras butter, but just too oily for me.As for our mussels entree, it turned out to be a huge bowl with thick-cut, grilled sourdough bread on the side to sop up the broth. The mussels were cooked just right, as the shells were slightly open and the meat was tender and plump, but they were much smaller in size than I would like. The broth was balanced - creamy with a slight kick from jalapeno and a subtle sweetness from the red onion. I honestly would have picked up that giant bowl and downed the remaining liquid if I was in a more casual place with more space to lift it.Of course, the dessert stole the show, with the acclaimed pastry chef here.The Mint Chocolate Pot de Creme was luxuriously smooth and uniquely refreshing.

Wait to be seated: Although this is a very busy and not too big of a place, we were a walk-in of three and were able to be seated in 45 minutes. They said they would call my cell when the table was ready (way better than some beeper system!) so we went down the street to wait at a bar. Perfect timing for a drink before our meal.2. Wait staff: We ended up seated at the bar, which we noted we would be willing to do, and the bartender gave us some great recommendations - what food was popular and what food was preferred by the staff. We order the cheddar biscuits (ORDER THESE!) and shared the Crab Cake sandwich with a size of cauliflower and pickles. Crab cakes were to die for, so fresh. And pickles/cauliflower were made in house and seasoned with a little kick - we loved them. However, we heard we should try to save room for dessert - which was a good choice.3. Desserts: We ordered the Sugar Pie, Citrus Cheesecake, and Donuts. The chocolate you dip the donuts in was a perfect touch, so yummy. And I've never had a cheesecake like this before; great balance of citrus and sweetness of cheesecake. ANd the sugar pie was recommended by the bartender (which was a GREAT choice.)4. Beer menu: Huge selection of craft brews, a must for Chicago and a great way to pair and balance out a great meal. Wouldn't have been the same without the beer.If you go - order exactly what we did.

Look bitches, if I was a legitimate food critic, I'd be popping the top of Tom Colicchio's Le Creuset or massaging Jeffrey Steingarten's flabby ass with Extra Virgin Olive Oil but the fact is: I'm not. I'm just like me and me. And I only count in the aggregate.On the other hand, while I respect the democratization of taste, well, YOU KNOW I have a few reservations about democracy and group-think in let's say aesthetic matters. Some opinions matter more -- because, well, they're CORRECT. I mean, when those Greek elitist fucks were signing up slaves for entry to Plato's Republic of Philosopher-Kings and pederasts, I was all WOO GET ME A DAY PASS, BITCHES! and then they threw me in the cave where I was bum-rushed by Socrates.Behold the Scylla and Charybdis from which I can't escape 'cause I ain't Aeneas.

I think I can honestly speak on the following topic:Chocolate.I love chocolate.I love chocolate like a postal worker loves his glock, like a swinger loves his notched bedpost, like a teen loves her ripped hymen, like a gay man loves his ripped -- well, you get the picture.So when I say there's some pretty fine motherfucking chocolate and desserts at Hot Chocolate, you betta TRUST.Thanks to the expert scouting of my dining companion, we were only here for dessert. After waiting 20 minutes for seats at the bar (a table would have been an hour or more), we ponied up saloon-style and defrosted from the 15-degree weather in the buff, burnished space of exposed rafters, auburn banquettes, and caramel daybeds. The warm lights flickered across the dessert menu we perused as the chatter from the other patrons oscillated between vexatious and deafening. I ordered the \"Ode to the Whatchamacallit\" -- man, I loved that candy bar when I was a little shit -- along with a mug of Mexican Hot Chocolate.When the \"Ode\" arrived -- a milk chocolate peanut butter mousse with malted caramel, cocoa crisps peppering the plate, and a thin shot glass of a peanut butter milkshake -- I was a little skeptical. There was nothing Pindaric or, fuck, even Homeric about this \"ode\": instead of something elaborate, structured, and well-wrought, this so-called \"ode\" to my beloved Whatchamacallit was separated into the constituent elements! Ugh. WHAT THE FUCK, CHEF SEGAL?!?! But then I savored the sublimely nutty evanescence of the mousse as the dryness of the malt in the caramel supplied the gustatory antistrophe; I relished the milkshake as it rounded off both elements in a creamy epode; and I rejoiced. WELL-PLAYED, CHEF SEGAL! A worthy homage to a classic indulgence.Then I let the thick liquefied cacao of the Mexican Hot Chocolate course over my tongue like the undulations of the sultry Rio Grande. And you know what? I loved it so much I wanted to shove it up my ass. And had I done so, it would have been the first time anything Mexican was in my ass. Which is, like, a total lie. Even though it's the truth. Except for that time with the chorizo. Or that time with the prickly nopales. Or that time with Subcomandante Marcos and a fistful of Virgen de Guadalupe medallions.

For that alone, I almost want to go down to 3 stars, but that simply wouldn't be fair to the fabulous food and slick service we were provided. So let's get down to business! My champers was sweet and tasty. And well priced at $18 for a split. I liked the blossom champagne drink with lavender and a sugar cube too, but also to be appreciated was the Greyhound. Its just Grey Goose and grapefruit juice, but wowza, was it ever tasty! Appetizers included the sourdough bread with Parmesan butter spread and the beer soaked pretzels with cheese and mustard dipping sauces. The sourdough was piping hot and actually more on the multi-grainy side, so it was a nice surprise. The pretzels were the clear winner, though. Actually, the cheese sauce was the star. I believe the bowl was actually licked clean. Really. Our entrees ran the gauntlet from steak to gnocchi with pork cheeks to lamb sandwiches and the mushroom lasagna. Just a few issues with the food service before I start gushing. The steak was supposed to be served with a fried quail egg, but the kitchen didn't let us know they were out until it actually came to the table. Also, one of our lasagnas was delayed. Truly, no matter though, because the entrees were, in a word, scrumptious. The lasagna was described to me by Server Doug as rustic and hearty. He couldn't be more on target. It was heavy on the mushrooms, the fresh tomato sauce was on point and the crusty top layer of the lasagna was so good. I ate every bite, even the spout salad, which I'm fairly certain was a garnish. Now, dessert time. Shoot, this place is called Hot Chocolate, so I expected the desserts to be out of this world. And they were! My vanilla milkshake (topped with fresh, unsweetened whipped cream) was so, so, so good! Served with 2 cookies and an extra sidecar of milkshake, it was the perfect topper to my meal. The creme brulee was HUGE and the ice cream sampler was superb (the salted caramel and mint chip were the best). I simply cannot say enough about Doug, our server-extrondiaire.

The medium was made up of milk chocolate with a touch of dark chocolate and a hint of caramel (i think the caramel is what really sold me on it). Oh, and I can't forget the homemade marshmallows! It was as good as it sounds- and the fluffy homemade marshmallow was the key to making this extra tasty! As for our meals I ordered the homemade granola- a small serving, but perfect for me since \u00a0I was pretty full from the hot chocolate. \u00a0And I was stoked when my friend ordered the buttermilk pancakes so I could have a few bites- cinnamon pancake with pumpkin cheesecake cream and graham cracker crust! YUM! These very rich pancakes could give Bongo Room a run for their money...I noticed at a few tables nearby that the brioche french toast looked pretty tasty as well!

Is it a restaurant that happens to sell exquisite desserts or is it a dessert cafe that also has remarkably delicious food? Whichever it is, I'm officially a fan.Enticed in by my $10 A La Card, my beau and I had brunch there yesterday. We were warned that it would start filling up by 11:00, so we got there at 10:30, and it was already so busy that we had to sit at the bar, which wasn't a problem at all.I always look at online menus prior to my first visit, and their breakfast sandwich (fresh ricotta, roasted tomatoes, fried egg and herbs) sounded tailor-made for me, so you can imagine my dismay when I arrived, looked at the menu, only to discover that they changed it. I rebounded though, and ordered the current version, which was scrambled egg whites, avocado, and salsa verde, served on a toasted multi-grain baguette, with fresh fruit on the side.Naturally we started with the doughnuts, which were really more like churros, but they were damn delicious. Really, only the addition of a chocolate sauce (they're served with house-made raspberry preserves) would have made them more perfect. The raspberry preserves were no slouch, but a place with 'chocolate' in its name should serve it with as many menu items as possible.My bf ordered their smoked fish platter, served with a house-made bagel, smoked salmon and whitefish, incredibly ripe tomatoes, whipped cream cheese, red onions and capers. This beautiful presentation was a feast for the eyes.My sandwich was great and I enjoyed it, but I suspect I would have liked the one featured on their online menu even more. The scrambled egg whites were nice and fluffy and the avocado was appropriately chunky and smeared on both sides of the baguette, The salsa verde added a nice kick to the sandwich. The fruit served on the side was terrifically sweet and fresh and thankfully had no melon. I hate eating cheap filler fruit, but HC really delivered: kiwi, pink gala apples, orange segments and some of the best pineapple I've had in recent memory. The colors of the fruit looked beautiful together and made the presentation even more noteworthy.The smoked fish platter could rival any Jewish deli, and it came with a side of noodle pudding. For those of you familiar with 'kugel' - this is basically the same thing. Think of rice pudding, but denser, and less toothsome. Good stuff, and it would have made my Jewish grandmother proud.We also enjoyed some French-press coffee and freshly-squeezed orange juice. Our brunch was excellent, from start to finish.

I haven't had the pleasure of trying a bacon dessert item from her yet, but I eagerly await it.. Her burger with fancy bacon, aged cheddar and a fried egg is one of the at least top three best burgers in the city.2)Liberal use of butter - It's just wonderfully and welcomely in everything. Her fig bars redefine the cookie, scrambled eggs are like buttah because they're filled with it. Once I had a Swiss cheese, black pepper and honey croissant here that my mother still talks about.3)Liberal use of creativity toward presentation of American classics - Okay, I know this was a wordy category, but that's really what it it boils down to. She uses the same titles for her creations over and over again, like Chicken or Banana or Chocolate or one of her favorites, Cake and a Shake, and each time unleashes the full force of creativity on the medium of food like an artist. Pork might have pork belly and crackling along with tenderloin or sausage. My favorite dessert so far was a piece of red velvet cake with a tiny little red pop float with her homemade strawberry cheese cake ice cream. Her salted caramel ice cream might be my favorite of all times, and I don't say that lightly. 4)The hot chocolate. It is very, very good and served with fancy homemade marshmallows. It is very thick, strong and creamy.I took one star off because it can be pricey, parking in Bucktown is a bitch, once something I ate here made me sick as a dog, they close at times in the middle of the day, once or twice something didn't have a great execution and although most of the staff are pretty cool, one or two have gotten on my nerves before and taken the buzz off of my cocoa high.

I'd give Hot Chocolate a 4.5 if Yelp did half-stars. You are paying for presentation first and foremost here, not portions. That half a star is taken off for the costliness to portion ratio. Call me cheap, but a milkshake in a tall skinny glass maybe an 1\" across for $6 strikes me as a slight ripoff. Lindley got a passion fruit martini ($12). The soup of the day, mushroom barley, was $8 which also seems steep for a soup. We split two items. The spinach and duck confit salad ($10) was heavenly. It also included honeycrisp apples, \u00a0toasted squash seeds and butternut squash. It was fantastic. The Pleasant Ridge cheese in brioche was good, but I'm not sure it warrants the $15 price tag. Wow, this review is really making me sound stingy, but I am pretty broke right now, so it was hard for me to stomach the prices. My stomach loved the food though. A lot. The dessert we split was a special called Taste of Citrus. The presentation on this was impeccable. Three separate desserts on the plate. I think the Triple vanilla ice cream and blood orange sorbet baked Alaska topped my list. Second was the Buffalo milk \u00a0ricotta cheesecake. Oh my. I could have eaten a whole piece of this, I'm sure. The wee bites of citrus shortbread with tangelo curd were a bit too tart for my tastebuds. Overall though, dessert was best.

The hostess quickly seated us upon arrival and our waitress came over to our table shortly thereafter with menus and rattled off the specials for the evening. We quickly put in an order for a Three Floyd's IPA bomber to split from their decent beer and drink menu. The beer came out a few minutes later from the bar and was poured table side, which was nice. Our waitress came back a few minutes later, and we put in our dinner order as follows:1) artisanal cheese board: There were three cheese offerings on the board along with a fruit jam and a small piece of bread cut in half diagnonally. The cheese were good, but I'm sad to say that I have no idea what they were. I could pick out a gouda and a brie, but the menu didn't list which cheese were being offered and when the board arrived it was dumped at the table without an explanation. Our waitress came by as we were finishing the cheese, so it was too late to even bother asking at that point. The cheese were fantastic and we enjoyed the side salad of greens and candied nuts with apple slices that garnished the plate. I'd highly recommend this appetizer, but make sure to ask questions about the cheese in the ordering process.2)hamburger house-ground Heartland beef, organic bacon and Carr Valley 4-year-aged cheddar, house-made pickle on a garlic-toasted sesame bun served with \u00a0chips: Fellow yelpers, you truly think this is one of the BEST burgers in the city?! I would place it on par with any burger you can get at a bar or pub in the city, easily giving it a 4 or 5 out of 10. The bun was dry and flavorless, the top crunchy with the added texture of seasame seeds that I found off putting. I couldn't even taste the bacon OR the cheese, which was sorely disappointing. The meat did have a great smokiness to it, and that was about the only thing I enjoyed about the burger. The chips on the side tasted a little burnt and were cold. I'd much rather go to Owen & Engine, Kumas, or the Bad Apple for a much tastier burger for the same price. 3) beef bourguignon red wine braised Heartland Meats beef cheek with rutabaga, Thumbelina carrots, and cippolini onions: Another HUGE letdown. The meat lacked any flavor (seems to be a commonality with the main dishes here) and had a slightly burnt taste to it, as if they over-seared the meat while they were preparing it. Some of the bites had a gelatinous texture which was off putting. The sauce had a nice flavor to it, but it was lukewarm and couldn't save the meat. I'm sad I shelled out $26 for this travesty.Alrighty, now that I've aired my dislike of the food offerings at Hot Chocolate, let's focus on the true gem of this restaurant--the dessert menu. I can only attest to the hot chocolate offering, but they are out of this world. I've had the medium hot chocolate once at the restaurant a few months back, and have bought the mix at the store for preparation at home. It's incredibly creamy and savory with a rich chocolatey goodness. The house made marshmallows are a must and they kick the decadence of this beverage up several notches. Last night my boyfriend and I both went for the Mexican Hot Chocolate which was even better than the Medium offering. It was incredibly spicy, packing a punch of cinnamon and cayenne that was a great ending to the meal on a cold winter night. I want to come back and try their cheesecake as well as their donuts, as those sounded (and looked!) amazing.Hot Chocolate will always be at the top of my list for desserts, but I'd recommend skipping dinner and coming here only for a sweet indulgence. I now realize that there's a reason that the majority of the photos on yelp are focused on the desserts.", "Date": "2013-01-13", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Melissa H.", "ReviewID": "EPuiTt-uI6WS8RwT1RmxaQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hot ChocolateTuesday night, 8pm.The bar.A woman walks up.

While there, we took in the place, and we loved what we saw. Several four-person tables line the center, flanked by the bar on one side, and couples' tables along the entire wall of the other side. This means when the place gets crowded, you will be elbow to elbow with your neighbor. When seating began, we were taken to our seats and fresh water was promptly brought to the table (the waiter's assistant was on top of everything the entire time). Our waitress was in a great mood, excited about the food, and showed no qualms about answering all of our questions. We ended up ordering the highly recommended, boutique hamburger (mine with the egg, of course), and we were advised to share an order of the highly praised macaroni and cheese.In 15 minutes or so (time seemed to fly, so it could have been longer), our orders were delivered -- and they not only smelled delicious, the presentation was beautiful. I know this is a hamburger we're talking about, but these were pieces of art on a plate. The macaroni was served in a little crock pot. The first bite of my burger is one I will never forget, and I'm hungry for another as I type this! The 4-year aged Widmar cheddar was one of the best flavors my mouth ever had the pleasure of tasting -- and it paired perfectly with the garlic bun (which wasn't overly garlic tasting, which is good) and the seasoning of the beef. The absolute best burger flavors I've ever had in a boutique burger, hands down! The homemade pickles were great, as well. I should also point out that the burger is served with nothing but the bun, meat, and cheese -- with pickles, spicy mustard, and ketchup on the side.The macaroni and cheese was mind-blowingly delicious. Words cannot express how good it is, and the flavors are born from the perfect mix of Rothkase gruyere and Carr Valley mammoth cheddar. Rarely have I felt guilty for liking a food item, but this stuff is sinfully delicious.We didn't love our desserts nearly as much as we loved the main course, unfortunately. They weren't bad, per se, but they didn't stand a chance of being as good as the star of the show.Service was top notch: friendly, expedient, willing to take time with the patrons, etc., etc. At first, it seems like it'll be a \"stuffy\" place, but the staff brings the chic down to a wonderfully comfortable level.Without a doubt, the next time we're in Chicago, we will be going back to Hot Chocolate.

The rectangular slab of semifreddo would slowly melted over the warm, uber-custardy brioche and into the puddle of coffee-toffee-Moloko Milk Stout hot fudge. It was an assault to your palate. Creamy, richness, pillowy, sweetness, bitterness. It's one of best bread puddings I've ever had.The \"Mexican\" hot chocolate was comforting and welcoming to the brutal cold we encountered. I enjoyed the mild frothiness as you begin to drink it followed by warmth of chocolate washing down your esophagus. The subtle, ethereal tinge of the cayenne on your tongue was a beautiful sensation.

Don't get me wrong, the desserts were absolutely fantastic, but the rest of the menu was extremely subpar.Maybe my own expectations were too high. I don't know. My biggest complaints were the following:1. The seating arrangement--I HATE it when the hostess sits me and my party in one of those long booths that you have to share with other people ESPECIALLY when there are open tables all around. I had to spend the night cramped ass-to-ass between some loud-mouth wine yuppy (that I noticed paired the wrong port with her dessert!) and some 401k snob.2. The appetizer/salad/dinner menu. Nothing really sounded that tempting on the appetizer menu. I chose the pretzel and pate plate. It was good, but nothing special--all it was was a couple of soft pretzels and some braunschweiger liver sausage. My dinner wasn't bad, but I expected more. I had the hamburger, which tasted like a plain old brewpub burger. It came with some shredded raw cabbage and saltless potato chips.3. The \"organic\" effort---There is a fine line between making something healthy and making it tasteless. It's noble of them to boast fresh organic ingredients and support local farmers, but the term organic shouldn't equal lack of flavor. This is where they screwed up. As a result, the littlest things suffered---no seasonings or dressings on the sides, etc.On a good note, the desserts were simply out of this world. I had the \"cake and shake\"---a chocolate buttermilk cake with chocolate buttercream and a mini chocolate mint shake. It was divine, but my boyfriend's dessert was even better. Bananas Volume X was an Elvis-inspired explosion of flavors: homemade graham crackers layered with sauteed bananas, peanut butter ice cream, and a whipped cream/peanut butter mousse.

We arrived for our 6:30 reservation and were seated immediately. Our server was fantastic and the busboy always made sure my water was full which is great for anyone who gets thirsty. (please note that I am using a literary device known as \"foreshadowing\" here.)My husband and I ordered the pretzel appetizer (due to Yelper! recommendations) and a spinach/radicchio salad with duck bacon to start with. The pretzels were awesome.. You could taste the beer that was used to either make or boil the pretzels. They were appropriately salty and had the perfect hard on the outside, soft on the inside texture. The dipping cheese was similar in flavor to a classic cheese fondue, but a little richer and smoother. The mustard was the perfect combination of sweet and earthy.The salad was more of a miss. There was no radicchio on the plate (maybe they ran out?) and there was only one overriding flavor - that of the duck sausage. \u00a0It was really ducky. And I don't mean that in a 50's \"everything's a-ok\" way. I mean it in a gamey way. Not good.The place really filled up between our starter courses and our entrees. Maybe it's because it took an inordinately long time to get our entrees. This is not a reflection of the front of the house staff . They were great. But the kitchen was mighty slow.For our entrees, we ordered the hamburger (me) and the lamb with organic grits, artichokes and ramps. My hamburger was salty. So very salty. And it wasn't the cheese or the bacon. It was the burger itself. It was strange. It would have been made worse if (harken back several paragraphs) the man with the pitcher didn't make so many rounds to ensure my water was filled! It's like he saw what I was ordering and made a mental note to keep me satiated. But I digress.So the burger was salty and overcooked. But it wasn't as bad as overcooked and oversalted burgers I've had elsewhere. And the coleslaw (while standard) was nice and fresh and the homemade chips were great. My husband's lamb was out of this world. Cooked perfectly, tender, just amazing. The grits and artichokes were good as well.By the time we concluded our entrees, the place was packed. We were seated at a two-top along the northern wall. It became really loud. I don't know if it was because the ceiling was low where we were seated or if it's loud everywhere due to the brick walls and hardwood floors. Or if the two groups of women on either side of us were just trying to one-up each other with their shrieky banter.We ordered dessert. Again, the kitchen was way slow here. I had time for a few more glasses of water. The server was most apologetic about the time it was taking (we hadn't complained to her about it either). But the desserts arrived and they were amazing. I had the Banana, which came with banana bread pudding, unsweetened whipped cream, butterscotch sauce, banana shortbread-y things, brown sugar hot fudge and the most amazing ice cream that I have had in a long time (read: possibly ever), banana sour cream. I was so full but I couldn't stop eating. DH had one of the chocolate desserts - chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream and something else. I can't remember because I only had eyes for my banana dessert.When the server brought us our check, she gave us free brownies to take home to apologize for the wait. Sweet.

It was so tender and melty and just amazing I'm not really a pork fan but this has completely changed my mind. And as it should be the Mac and Cheese was in a category of it's own. SO good. Probably a good idea to get as a appetizer and share with the table than you own dish. It's way too creamy and rich to have as a meal.

The brunch menu is decent, covering the gamut from brioche french toast and pancakes to breakfast sandwich and warm doughnuts.

An awesome treat.-- Mexican Hot Chocolate: with cinnamon and cayenne pepper. Not as good as the half & half in my opinion, but a unique flavor.-- Bloody Marys: Mom had two of these. Spicy and alcoholic, just how she likes them. -- Veggie scramble with caramelized onions, ricotta, toast. I didn't try it but my brother enjoyed it.-- Quiche with cheddar, corn and lardons -- quite good, but rich. The field greens had a dressing that was on the sweeter side, which I liked. -- Smoked fish platter -- with smoked salmon, whitefish, homemade bagel, and the fixin's. Totally lackluster and generally wasn't appetizing. And the homemade bagel left a lot to be desired.-- Nutter Butter and Peppermint Oreo cookies: bleh. These are more like cookie bars. Obviously they sound great, but I just didn't love them. Kind of greasy and I wish the Nutter Butter was crispier rather than chewy.

The biscuits were small which left plenty of room for my green salad with homemade balasmic dressing and macaroni & chesse and my Mom's steak. The macaroni & cheese was definately a grown-up version of a childhood classic, it was SOOOOOO good, and rich, yet the portion wasn't huge which made it perfect.

My darling and I came here on a whim for our one year anniversary. I had plans to cook him a romantic dinner, but we were already out and figured it would be just as great if we went out (and spared him of having to do the dishes). I had heard of Hot Chocolate and knew the neighborhood, and since I am still new to Chicago there weren't many options to consider. Luckily, this turned out to be an amazing choice. We started off with the pretzel appetizer. Super yummy (watch out for that mustard -- it is potent!) and a good sharing size. My sweetie had a beer and I had a moscow mule (yummy! I had two in the end). The (very nice and attentive) waiter recommended the pork chop for my boyfriend and I had the mac n cheese (thinking this would be a conservative choice that would justify getting dessert and hot chocolate). WOWZA. The pork chop was on fire! Huge portion and perfectly cooked. The flavor was amazing. Worth the price tag.Now how do I describe the mac n cheese? Remember when you were a kid and Kraft mac n cheese (or Velveeta, depending on your household) was THE BEST THING EVER? Then remember how you grew up and that stuff never tasted the same, but you never seem to find anything that tasted as amazing as the mac n cheese you had as a kid? No? Okay, maybe its just me. However, for me, Hot Chocolate's mac n cheese is the closest thing I have found that allows my adult taste buds to return to that childhood cheesiness perfection. What I mean is -- this stuff is GOOD. It is SO rich, SO flavorful, SO perfectly textured. It totally blew me away. Totally perfect -- get this! I ordered the \"thoughts on a peanut butter cup\" dessert and the chai hot chocolate. My lovely had the pear dessert. Everything in this section was REALLY GOOD. I loved the peanut butter dessert. YUMMY.The price tag really depends on what route you take. If you go here for the full restaurant experience its a $$$ experience, but completely worth it. We had 2 cocktails, 2 beers, 1 appetizer, 1 entree, 1 mac n cheese dish, \u00a02 desserts, and 1 hot chocolate and the price tag was $120 without tip which I think is completely reasonable. The quality alone justifies it, but to top it off the portions are meant for real humans and not the elves so many fine dining restaurants are apparently catering to. It is also worth noting, that the menu had a variety of dining (price) options, so you could have a nice meal and spend less if that's what you want to do. You can come here just for the dessert, but honestly, you'd be missing out.Also, ambiance is perfect for a romantic evening. Gentleman, take a lady here! You will impress her.

The bread pudding was outrageously good and worth a return trip, the baked alaska was interesting and true to form but not our favorite and finally the doughnuts and warm chocolate sauce were disappointingly warm and no where near as tasty as Doughnut Vault.Mindy is still cranking out really good and interesting desserts and I wish it was possible to try all in one sitting.

And the hunk of homemade marshmallow on the side is sweet without making your teeth ache... perfect!The atmosphere is cool, and if you're only going for drinks and a dessert they've got a nice big area at the front where you can sit and enjoy. If you are going for dinner, I do have one piece of advice: make a reservation. When we were there, there was a couple involved in a lengthy tirade with a waitress first and then a manager. They apparently had walked in and tried to wait for a table, and had been waiting twice as long as they were supposed to. It made for excellent entertainment while we sipped our drinks, but was probably not as fun for the two of them.

So a group of us go to Hot Chocolate for dinner and drinks and of-course dessert. The night started out amazing; the host was SUPER AMAZINGLY sweet. They had a wait and she would update us on our wait time and was just down right nice. We all commented on the friendly host they had. Then we get seated and once again; amazing server. He too was extra friendly and explained the menu and took really good care of us. We once again commented on the staff and how great they all were. They even gave us free monkey bread (which was finger linkin' good - btw) cause they were a little behind in the kitchen and did not want us to wait any longer for food. And we once again - we thought wow! Nice people!!! So the food comes out and everything is great. We're all loving our meals. The hamburger was awesome (with a fried egg on top, please!). Really good stuff...So then why the 3 stars you may ask... Halfway through the meal I remember I had not told the server that we had a restuarant.com coupon and I felt that they should know; that's the fair thing to do. And then everything goes down hill; even though we tipped on the original bill. The server just disappeared! \u00a0He took a good 10 to 15 minutes to take our dessert order and then it took them about 20 to 25 to bring the dessert out to us. At one point we even tried to cancel the order but could not get the server's attention. And for some odd reason it was hot as hell in there. Like the heat was on hot. People were fanning themselves with their menu. We were sweating hot! Crazy!!! Oh then I talk to one of my friends after dinner and she tells me that there was a LONG piece of hair in her lamb sausage. Gross, gross, gross. Think meat and hair... Disgusting!Anyways, sad the evening ending bad because I love Hot Chocolate. I guess the next time I go there I just won't tell them about the coupon.

It was a Friday night, and I had a fake final the next day. I wanted to celebrate and get ready for an amazing weekend of being done with school and hanging with my beau. But really, what I needed, was macaroni and cheese. Sometimes, I crave it. So I searched yelp and decided that this was the place to try the macaroni and cheese.I was not disappointed. It was rich, creamy and had a wonderful crust of browned cheese on the top. The portion size was not small. Do not get tricked into thinking that it is. At the end of the bowl, I could not have put any more macaroni and cheese into my body. It wouldn't have been possible in any sense at all. But it was delicious and it helped me get over my craving.Since I went with Brian K, we decided to split dessert and each get some hot chocolate. I got the medium hot chocolate and we split the doughnuts. And the doughnuts were very delicious; light and fluffy, with a wonderful sugar coating on them. The hot chocolate was also good; not too dark and not too light either, a perfect blend. The homemade marshmallow was delicious too, but I couldn't add it to the hot chocolate because it was too rich. My whole meal was the richest thing I have ever eaten in my life, and I'm not sure if I went back that I would make the same choices. Definitely I would try a dessert and some hot chocolate, but maybe I'd get a salad and split the mac and cheese. The tables next to us both got the beet salad, and it looked delicious, especially if you love beets (which I do).The atmosphere was nice, even though it was quite crowded at 9:30 at night.

I came here with a couple of friends on a Wednesday evening for a girls night out. The plan was to share a bottle of wine and split some appetizers and dessert. When we told the hostess that we were mainly interested in dessert, she said we could sit in the \"lounge\" or at the bar, even though there were plenty of open tables. If it were super crowded, I'd be totally OK with not taking up a regular table, but it wasn't crowded, it was more than half empty. But, we weren't in the mood to put up a fight so we agreed to sit in the lounge. Turns out the lounge is an open area up front with those ridiculously low benches and tiny round tables that trendy restaurants like to have. Plus, it was cold and the music was way too loud. Not \"I'm an old lady turn down the music\" too loud, but honest to goodness we have to shout to hear one another too loud. It's a Wednesday at 6 for goodness sakes, turn the music down. Anyhow, the lounge was totally uncomfortable and it would have been impossible to actually eat food there (tiny tables can barely hold 3 wine glasses, never mind 3 desserts and some appetizers), so we asked to be switched to a real table. We were told that they'd \"have to see what's available.\" Let me remind you, it was a Wednesday night at 6 - half of the tables in the place were empty. We could clearly see 10 open tables, any one of which would have been fine. After a little bit of fussing on their part, we were told that a table was available (duh), and they moved us. Everything was great from then on. Food was great, wine was good, service was polite, and dessert was out of this world. My only minor complaint was that the milkshake was nothing special - I'd skip it next time. So, this place gets 4 stars because we ultimately had a great time there.

We arrived at around 7:30 and were seated immediately. We were greeted right away and gave our orders, so no problems there. Our orders were duck, tuna melt, and burger (medium).About 45 minutes later, no food. Not cool. We were all starting to feel a little woozy, so we flagged our server, who told us our food was in the window. He must have thought he saw it, because this was clearly not true. It took at least another 15-20 for our food to arrive. I tasted my friend's duck, and it was delish. The tuna melt was also reportedly delicious.My burger, however, not so much. It was overcooked and underwhelming. To be honest, nothing separated it from a burger I'd grill at home besides the house-made pickles (which were pretty darn good, I admit). I'd heard so many great things about it but ended up very disappointed. We were kinda bummed out about the state of dinner, but figured some hot chocolate would salvage our feelings. This was a correct assumption.

I really do love this restaurant. It was one of the first restaurants that I tried when I moved to Chicago about 6 years ago. I have also chosen this restaurant for out of town guests. I am also literally addicted to chocolate, so the super rich hot chocolate is perfect in my opinion. The delicious homemade marshmallow is also a nice touch! \u00a0I just really wish they could get dinner right! I feel like it is so hit and miss, especially considering the price of the entrees at this restaurant. There is just always something a little off. For example, the last time I ate here I had the Steak. I believe it cost $30. I was not expecting a large steak for that price, so the thin cuts of steak brought to me were fine. I asked for it cooked medium which it looks like they successfully accomplished. When I went to eat the steak, parts of it were so chewy, or riddled with fat that I couldn't finish it. Some sort of yogurt sauce was on the side, but I didn't feel that the flavors really complimented the steak. Super disappointing! I found myself just trying to get through it so that I could order dessert.My boyfriend had the fried chicken. It looked beautiful, but was very dry. Initially I was jealous I did not order it, but after tasting it, and chewing it for a while... I was wishing we had both ordered something different. I honestly cannot recall a memorable dinner entree from the many times I have eaten here. On the other hand the appetizers have been very good, I love ordering the mussels. I also really enjoy the soup here. I once had a Turnip soup that was DELICIOUS. Honestly, I find myself much happier (both with the food and the price) when I stick with soup and their Aged Cheddar grilled cheese on Pumpernickel. The sandwich is the perfect size with soup, and I still have room for dessert!Now I really do enjoy the dessert here. I have had the infamous chocolate tart with salted caramel ice cream. I also enjoy trying her seasonal desserts. Every dessert I have ever had I really did enjoy very much!! I also like how when I order coffee they bring me my own french press with a stainless steel pot of fresh cream. Very nice touch!!!It is obvious to me that this restaurant really tries to integrate local and seasonal produce, meats and dairy into their menu. I appreciate that.

Also, it turns out I really hate kale.Anyway, after that fun discovery, I decided to erase the awful thoughts with desserts. \u00a0I went with the chocolate souffl\u00e9, which came to me served in a a little cast iron pan topped with salted caramel ice cream... very good, probably best dessert of the night. The key lime pie was nothing special, didn't even taste the lime in it... mostly crust. Disappointing.Bread pudding was meh.

The bread basket was excellent - really great combination of unusual, freshly made breads. And they have the best hot chocolate in the city (well, with a name like that, you'd hope so). They have three options, and we tried them all - each seemed better than the previous one! You can't really make a bad choice here, and the walls, also painted in different shades of chocolate, make a nice complement to the frothy mug of goodness.Friday dessert - This restaurant takes its soothing chocolate colors and transforms into a beautifully dark late night space, almost lounge-like. The music is also pretty eclectic, and the vibe was perfect for some desserts and sipping. And what desserts they were! We arrived an hour before they closed, and our server was very accomodating. He recommended a couple desserts, but said we could ask for something else if we didn't like it much since the kitchen was wrapping up.

Well first off, I suggest you make reservations or go earlier in the day. My friends and I showed up around 9pm and we didn't get seated until almost 10pm. And while we were waiting another huge crowd of people showed up. But let me tell you, that wait was well worth the meal we had.First off our waiter was hilarious and nice. Since we had ample time to look at the menu we ordered right away and yet, we still waited another 20 minutes. I ordered the hamburger with the egg sunnyside up with a side of the leek and potato au gratin. It was delicious. The egg yolk was gooey and fit the burger just right. It was probably the best burger I've ever had in my life. The leek and potato was also very good, but didn't seem seasoned enough. My friend ordered the mac and cheese and it was not that impressive, she even added tobasco sauce for taste.. And my other friend ordered the chicken, that took the longest to cook, she waited almost 30 minutes for it. But, it was well seasoned and had a side of the leek and potato au gratin and enjoyed every bite, and even had leftovers. The portions they gave were very copious amounts and generous which we didn't expect. And of course you don't want to forget dessert. I recommend the dark hot chocolate. It's really not that bitter at all, but it's so rich and delectable. I would recommend you drink this on an empty stomach. I was too full so I just had a couple sips, and got a to go cup for the rest. And it comes with a homemade marshmallow!And for real dessert, I suggest the Banana Bread Pudding. BEST banana bread pudding ever!!! I recommend all the way. The creme brulee was alright, it was not custard like enough, it was more melted almost, but came with a tiny raspberry rugelach. And the baked alaska was good minus the sauce they drizzle around it, I gotta say that part is the acquired taste.

Those cookies were enough to confirm my original thoughts: I must visit Mindy's. And soon!Last Sunday, we made the journey out from the burbs (it really was a quick car ride, but journey sounds more fun!). We were able to sit at the bar near the kitchen so we could see the action. The bar chairs were extremely comfortable. I could have sat there all day.The staff. Funny, friendly and helpful. I was amused for our entire visit and when I wasn't sure as to what I might enjoy best, I received great suggestions from the staff. \u00a0The Sunday mid-day atmosphere. Open, noisy and upbeat. Lots of friends meeting for brunch, families laughing and couples enjoying themselves (we were the last group). The noisy was a good noisy, like a buzz going throughout the restaurant. We could easily carry on a conversation between the two of us and the bartender. The food. Here's where it gets complicated. The Executive Chef changes up the menu regularly (maybe even daily from what I gathered) and I wanted to try a bite of everything. \u00a0I started with a dark hot chocolate with a homemade marshmallow. It was rich and thick and downright decadent. This was only the second homemade marshmallow that I've had in my life and I loved it! \u00a0Plus, once I had a few bites, I put it in my hot chocolate and it didn't just melt away into nothing. We shared homemade cinnamon and sugar donuts with fresh preserves. Normally the thought of mixing fruit with my donuts doesn't appeal to me. In this case, it was the perfect combo. The donuts were hot, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and balanced just right when topped with the preserves. We tried the pork belly hash. The description on the menu didn't do it justice! \u00a0It was ah-may-zing!!! \u00a0Blanched red potatoes were semi-smashed and crisped up with pork belly renderings. Served with pieces of the pork, thinly shaved carrots and onions. A fried egg should adorn this dish, but because I'm a PITA, I kindly requested it on the side. The pork belly hash is addicting! \u00a0My husband said that the fried egg was one of the best he'd ever had - well seasoned and cooked just right. We shared a side of smokey bacon - very good, but we were still loving that pork belly. The brioche toast was served with whipped butter and the homemade preserves. I'm getting hungry just writing this review!Anyhow, Mindy and her crew definitely have a handle on the baked goods. As for the savory dishes, the new Executive Chef is mixing it up just right.

I spend a lot of time searching out the best places worldwide to feed my addiction, and this restaurant/lounge may be the best of them. DO NOT MISS THIS: You must try the iced medium hot chocolate. This is the best chocolate drink I've found anywhere. It's a mix of dark and milk chocolate with a hint of caramel, topped off with a homemade marshmallow. It's become something of an obsession - I visited HC three times in the course of two weeks to have it. Now that we've gotten the preliminaries out of the way, we can talk about the rest of the restaurant.The front of the space is the lounge, and it's useful to note that the bar (which isn't very large) and lounge do have the full menu. The tables in the restaurant are fairly close together, and it can get a little cramped, but if you're ever there on a Thurs-Sat night you'll see why. There's a large, private table in the back that can be booked for parties - I've been to two birthday dinners there, and it accommodates 8 (the minimum to not be charged extra for the space) to 12 people. The restaurant tends to be on the loud end, though the private section helps keep the noise level down. There's also art everywhere - it's of an edgier, sometimes disturbing variety (currently, there are photographs of disembodied dolls hanging near the bathroom).Service is excellent.The food is of consistently high quality in general, both in presentation and preparation, and the menu changes constantly. HC uses local ingredients and the menu lists the farms that they source their meat and produce from. That said, I've sometimes been disappointed with the food. Hands down, the best item on the menu was a braised rabbit from a few weeks ago - but I've had dishes that were oversalted or just didn't quite work. Entrees usually run around $20-30 each.But one doesn't really visit a place called Hot Chocolate for the food. Pastry chef Mindy Segal has been nominated for two James Beard awards, and there's good reason - the desserts are incredible.

Boy, were we lucky! This place is poppin'.To start off with, 2 friends and I shared a Half and Half hot chocolate, which is half espresso and half dark hot chocolate. OMG, seriously the best hot chocolate ever (I've had this one more than once--I stand by my assessment). It comes with a house made marshmallow which melts nicely in the cocoa and makes it pretty damn fabulous. It's quite rich though, so I'd recommend sharing. We also started off with a plate of warm doughnuts, which were coated in cinnamon sugar and came with raspberry preserves on the side. Delicious.I also had a pineapple/passionfruit smoothie, which is not too big and also really really good.I (and 2 of my friends each) ordered the duck hash, which consisted of duck confit, sweet potatoes, onions, and a fried egg on top. Mmmm.. a very good choice.On our way out, we picked up some bacon chocolate chip cookies, which are a must try if you get the chance.All in all, will definitely be back. Looking forward to trying out dinner. If you come and it's packed (very likely), just know that the hot chocolate and cookies can be ordered to go.

While I'm not really a dessert person, my dinner mates and I decided to each order a dessert.

Right, so a pretty good sign of things to come, right?My friend & I both got the quiche of the day, which I STILL can't stop talking about (the crust! the crust!), and our dates both got egg sandwiches - the biscuit & sausage one was amazing, and the ham and pesto one also incredible!I know I'm gushing, but it was a dining experience I won't soon forget, or stop talking about!

Nevertheless, I thought a trip to Hot Chocolate for my mother's birthday during 2011 Chicago Chef's Week was worth the risk. Well, the gamble paid off -- and we still ended up dropping a \u00a0significant amount of money despite the discount (which is presumably what a restaurateur hopes for by participating in these events). Since it was a birthday, naturally half our bill was booze. Highlights include a well-balanced Manhattan, Satan's Whiskers, which was a majestic color thanks to the blood orange juice, and the unsurprising but \"real-tasting\" chocolate martini.The beet salad was perhaps one lettuce leaf too petite, and the beets themselves could have been pickled for perhaps a few days longer. The rye croutons had the same problem -- a lack of tenderness. The soup fared much better -- a custard-like cauliflower soup topped with fried capers really captured the essence of my favorite white vegetable. I have had some of the largest, most tender scallops in this city recently, and Hot Chocolate's were no exception! They had a nice Maillard-effect crust on top and came with delicious greens. The pork itself was great, but I found the pickled ramp puree distracting. Daniel noted that it reminded him of the relish at McDonald's (does that still exist?), and it just reminded me of one flavor taking charge rather injudiciously.Dessert. Naturally, this was the best part (though, if memory serves me, a previous dessert at Hot Chocolate quite disappointed (it involved a pretzel?)). The Quebecois sugar pie was fantastic. Think: pecan pie minus pecans. Plus, the crust was made with bacon fat, and the whole thing was topped with a luscious orb of whiskey-maple ice cream. Absolute heaven.The halvah took second place; either Daniel ate it and I didn't get to try it or its flavor was totally drowned out by the catcalls of several chocolate forms on the plate -- the chocolate porter ice cream being one of them. It was that mouth-numbingly chocolatey experience one comes to loathe after awhile.Speaking of! Our waiter, who was positively charming and conversational and kind to my chatty parents, sent us a plate of caramel corn and donuts standing erect in a pool of warm chocolate sauce. It made the lackluster halvah experience fade from memory (mostly).I'm so glad Mindy (who politely visited our table) and her team made the experience worthwhile for my family despite the inauspiciousness of the week.

The hostess said that there were 5 reservations for time slots ahead of us so if you want a table on a Thursday through Sunday i would highly recommend making a reservation. Once seated at the kind of small but very aesthetically pleasing bar we were served by a knowledgeable and amicable bar tender who exemplified excellent service.

I tried the cucumber cooler signature cocktail and it was excellent and appropriate for the season.The seasonal nature of the menu ended up being something that i both loved and disliked about this place in that the summer items just came off as a little too common and uninspired for a restaurant with so much critical acclaim.

I ordered the tuna salad which consisted of seared sushi grade ahi tuna accompanied by some summer greens and a light, viscous vegetable puree that added a more earthy edge to something that is usually served spicy. Service was impeccable until they brought the tuna melt instead of the tuna salad, but the problem was fixed in less than 20 minutes and we were given an incredibly generous discount on our check for the inconvenience. I wish that i had ordered dessert because i had heard and read, if nowhere else than in the doorway to the entrance, that chocolate is kind of what this place does, so when i return for the fall/winter menu i will be sampling the dessert for sure. Overall a great spot on a very cool neighborhood with an earthy and artistic take on a simple Americana menu.

A different take on it than I've seen before-- other cassoulets I've had have been a bit more colorless since they're primarily white beans, but this one was warmer/reddish since I believe they put tomatoes or tomato paste in it. And they do a fantastic (house made) lamb sausage instead of the traditional chunks of lamb. The best part of the dish, however, was the DUCK CONFIT. The best duck I've ever tasted hands down, from the falling-off-the-bone meat to the crispy skin and exceptionally flavorful fat. I could have eaten a whole duck cooked that way in one sitting.THE BAKED ALAKSA.Since it's the holiday season I wanted to go for something Christmas-y and rich for dessert, and the warm pool of eggnog glaze that surrounded the attractively presented little dome of toasted marshmallow/meringue was so good that I scraped every last bit off my plate with my spoon. Hehe.THE HALF-AND-HALF HOT CHOCOLATE.I've had this before on another occasion, and it's both incredibly rich like the other hot chocolates AND a nice pick-me-up since it's got all that espresso. Mmm. The homemade marshmallows they serve with all the hot chocolates are also a nice touch, and such a dramatic step above store-bought ones.Could have been better:The Tuna Melt. My mom ordered this since she wasn't as hungry as I was, and since she wanted to save more room for dessert. The sandwich was just a big... Meh. We had expected chunks of good quality tuna, but my mom thinks it was probably from a can. The cheese on the sandwich was good (I think I recall gruy\u00e8re, maybe?) but the tuna was not of the quality you'd expect at Hot Chocolate, and the volume of bread overwhelmed the fillings. And that's my ultimate pet peeve with sandwiches... when they have yummy fillings, but you can barely taste them through mouthfuls of too-crusty, too-big bread. I'm a Hyde Parker, and I think Z&H (on 47th and 57th streets) has better and more imaginative sandwiches than this, for around $7.The verdict? The best things to order at Hot Chocolate are the hot chocolates which are fantastic, the elegantly crafted and beautifully presented desserts, and the more complex entr\u00e9es. Yes, they serve burgers... which I'm sure are delicious, and sometimes you're just in the mood for a burger.

I liked my friend's burger because it was overcooked almost to a crisp and dry. I'm probably in the minority of people who like my meat cooked very-well done, therefore I can see a lot of people hating the burger. I paid $15 for a SMALL glorified cheese calzone. It was nothing special and definitely not worth the price. Although I have to say that the presentation of the food was very nice.Service: We were a group of six so the 18% gratuity was already included in our bill..and it seemed that our server knew that all too well. Our server was stop and go, and would walk away before we could ask a second question. Also, when taking our order he was suppose to go back to one person who wasn't ready on the first take, but he forgot and walked away before taking down her order...thus taking even more time get his attention back to our table.

My brother and I walked into Hot Chocolate on a Sunday evening around 6:00, and took s seat at the bar. (A little advise given by employers Rachel and Roshell, it's their slower time of the week) \u00a0Luke told us about the beers of the month, and their specials for the evening, which of course changes with the seasons. \u00a0We ordered the charred octopus. \u00a0They were perfect, not too rubbery, and perfectly crisp on the outside. \u00a0The feta and vinigairette paired very well.For the main course, I ordered the berkshire pork loin served with grits. \u00a0You can't go wrong with a well brined berkshire pork loin. \u00a0It was amazing as I expected, but the Plapp Farm grits were outgrageous. They complimented the pork with the pickled Okra resulting in a combustion of flavor. The grits had a nice creamy texture, not too buttery, thick, but not too thick. \u00a0I could've eaten another bowl or bucket of this... but anyways, my brother ordered the burger. \u00a0I asked Mindy, \"Why is this burger so damn good?\" \u00a0She said that it's just the quality of the heartland beef with the organic bacon, which gives the Carr Valley 6-yr aged Cheddar a nice little smoky flavor to it. \u00a0She didn't tell me this, but I'm just guessing that it isn't ground chuck, maybe a ground sirloin mixed with ground brisket. \u00a0The flavor and juiciness was impeccable.Now I know what you're thinking, a couple guys grabbing dinner, there is no way they are going to order dessert and stick around. \u00a0You're right, we ordered it all to go. \u00a0Yep, all of it! \u00a0I wasn't about to leave the restaurant of the renowned patisserie Mindy Segal, without seeing what she is all about. \u00a0So I decided to order the brioche doughnuts, the cookie box, and the ice cream & Sorbet flight.The Brioche doughnuts came with the best caramel corn I have ever tasted in my life. \u00a0The doughnuts were nice and soft, and even better when dipped into the dish of fudge. \u00a0The assortment of all the petite cookies, gave me the true understanding on how much time is devoted to each individual pastry. \u00a0The mini Petite fours were pieces of heaven, each with different flavors, and all a buttery goodness.The ice creams were a trip alone, I wish I had a list of what each of them were. \u00a0Luke told me before I left, but completely forgot by the time I made it home. \u00a0The one that stuck out the most, was the salted Caramel. \u00a0I never had such a punch of flavor coming from something so cold.As a little treat, Luke through in a couple chocolate chip bacon cookies. \u00a0I had them a week prior to this at the Taste of Nation event, I noticed a few people picking at the crumbs. \u00a0yes, they were that good.", "Date": "2009-08-26", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Thomas L.", "ReviewID": "Lgpj0I6R46TieDbI7x8R2A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If Martha says it's good well..............

Forget ambiance, service, and every other criterion. \u00a0The reason this place is a must is simple: best hot chocolate in the city, and at least 7-10 variations depending upon the rotating menu. \u00a0I detail two of them below. \u00a0CAUTION: This place is AWESOME about rotating the menu!!! \u00a0So, I'm steering away from too many specific menu-item reviews.However, I know your real concern, too, and let me just say that the location did not impact my particular visit. \u00a0With that, let's just address it.HIPSTER FACTOR: Surprisingly, MODERATE.Seriously! \u00a0Despite being in the heart of Grand Hipster Terminal (the 6-corner of North, Damen & Milwaukee; colloquially and correctly known as \"The Crotch\" intersection to actual Chicagoans), this place did not have a terrible hipster factor when I visited it. \u00a0The neighborhood definitely causes concern that there might be a routinely irregular massive Hipster gathering at some point during the week, but there were no wannabe intellectuals, yetis, or pseudo-punk 80's people when we sat for Sunday brunch. \u00a0Maybe I've discovered something: maybe Hipsters don't do brunch? \u00a0Ignore the picture of the spazz with the tattoos on the \"Gift Cards\" link of its website's homepage because that thing DOES NOT represent the average crowd. \u00a0I digress. \u00a0Onto the actual review: 4/5, and only because the menu, which constantly changes, had too many sweet items on it.Indeed, the ambiance and food were good. \u00a0On a Sunday at 11:00 A.M., I have now three times enjoyed the hustle of a relatively normal brunch sitting. \u00a0All three times with party sizes varying, and were immediately sat or had a very short wait despite the line being outside the door. \u00a0(We just happened to not be a monstrous group.) \u00a0It has the industrial look to it, and just be mindful that their products are popular enough to generate a little bit of storefront action even on a Sunday.As for the food, brunch is chic and trendy. \u00a0They feature donuts, the new \"it\" dessert, and yes, their donuts are freshly prepared, brilliantly executed, and consist of unique flavor pairings--for donuts--like maple and bacon. \u00a0You have some variation of a super-sweet French Toast and the standard two-egg breakfast at all times. \u00a0The items change pretty routinely, and they compliment the eponymous drinks. \u00a0Quiches are done well; all items come veggie optional; and the menu balances the savory fairly well. \u00a0Expounding upon the veggie comment, veggie items are not pronounced if you're feeling sensitive about your vegetarianism that day, so grow a backbone (from tofu or something, I imagine) before you go there and ask what your options and substitute ingredients are. \u00a0(I went there with a vegetarian, and she did just fine because she has a backbone.) \u00a0The reason we don't get to five stars is actually because one such trip did focus a little too much on the sweets, but I attribute that to more of my personal preference. \u00a0Thus, feel free to count that bias against me if you're a true blue sweet tooth and not a moody one like me.Returning to those hot chocolate options, the fudge-based Black & Tan ought to be illegal because it's so damn good. \u00a0You know that little sprig of joy you experience when you've had something truly, succulently, and richly chocolate. \u00a0This is your drink. \u00a0I could have had that and only that and been fully satiated for the rest of the day. \u00a0(Indeed, I was served at 11:37 A.M. and did not eat again until 8:00 P.M. or so.) \u00a0If you like the 'Peppermint Mocha' of several restaurant and beverage chains, then Hot Chocolate's Peppermint option--again, if on the menu--is your drink. \u00a0Finally and, well, if you just like hot chocolate, then any of their options will destroy your previous expectations on the topic. \u00a0No other place will have as good of hot chocolate.I hear their alcoholic drinks, but I had torn up the scene the night beforehand, so a mimosa or alcoholic hot chocolate variation did not even cross my mind.", "Date": "2014-02-18", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Karyn K.", "ReviewID": "e6JtNRGju5G9YVBfLgeogA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband surprised me with dessert at Hot Chocolate this past Saturday after we had gone out to dinner for our anniversary.

My friends and I ordered the Malbec, and it was delicious. One friend ordered a Matilda beer, and that was good too. Then we got seated not too long afterwards.

Instead, we got the lamb. It was very good. I loved how they prepared it. Just the right amount of seasoning, and it wasn't too salty or too-anything. Still, I would have liked to have tried the rabbit there, especially if the lamb and the salmon (what our friends got) was so good. I'm a bit lactose-intolerant, but my friends and I ordered dessert.

Atmosphere, 5 stars: This place is super romantic. The low-lighting, mirrored walls and candles ooze with sensuality that comes out in the desserts and hot drinks. Service, 3 stars: We were there on a Sunday with a mostly empty restaurant, but still stood inside the doors for a good 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence. I think it may have been a mistake to have only one real server for the whole restaurant, too. At the beginning of our meal, it was fine since the place was empty, but as it began to fill, we saw less and less of our server and had to flag down people to get our water bottle refilled. The service we did get was friendly, though, so maybe it was an off night. Food, 4 stars: We asked for recommendations, and while all the food we ordered was good, we also specifically asked to make sure it wasn't a lot so we'd have room for \u00a0dessert. Apparently, the server was more interested in our check size than our happiness with the meal. We ordered two hot chocolates (chai and medium) which randomly came in the middle of the second course after we'd asked about them earlier. The chai was okay, but the medium was actually our favorite of the two. The homemade marshmallows on the side are soft and sweet, melting perfectly in the rich chocolate if that's your method (it's definitely mine). The pretzel appetizers were incredibly tasty with a smelly, but tasty fondue cheese and a sweet and tangy mustard dipping sauces. We then split the mushroom salad which was good, but could have used a bit more of the delicious, grilled mushrooms in the salad name. We shared the roasted half chicken (great) and the macaroni and cheese side dish (skip it, very creamy, but almost soupy), which was tasty, but at this point, we were holding our stomaches and didn't finish in the interest of sharing a dessert. The peanut butter cup dessert was everything we dreamed it would be, and was remarkably light and not too heavy on the peanut butter flavor as many of these types of desserts can be. Dessert is definitely where Hot Chocolate shines, so on my next trip, I may skip the entrees and just have some of those amazing pretzels and as many items from the dessert menu as possible.

I normally avoid home-made chips because they usually are too hard for me (I once cracked a tooth on some really hard bruschetta and since then am paranoid about eating hard food) - these were thin and crispy and not hard on your teeth at all.I also had a bite of the lamb sausage sandwich and it was really good.We shared the dessert - the Chocolate #1 which is chocolate souffl\u00e9 with salted caramel ice cream.

The food was very good, but the atmosphere and service detracted somewhat. The (early-30ish, male) waiter started off on a bad foot with me because he kept referring to me (late 20s) and my (60-year-old) coworker as \"the girls\" (\"What are the girls having?\" \"Are the girls ready to order?\" etc.) He finally knocked it off when I mirrored it back to him: \"Yes, 'the girls' are ready to order, thank you!\" It just sounded condescending and cheesy, and unnecessary. He improved over time by making good suggestions and comments on what we were ordering, at least, though he did disappear at the end when we wanted to get the check.The atmosphere was dark and loud, and got darker and louder as the meal progressed (they kept turning the music up and the lights down). By the end I was leaning across the table to hear what my dining companion was saying. We were sitting at the row of small tables that line one wall; I can't imagine how the people sitting in the middle of the room could hear anything, caught as they were between the smaller tables and the bar. If the food had been bad, this meal would have been a futile exercise, but it made it worthwhile. We both had the macaroni and cheese, which comes in individual casseroles. Below the bubbly baked brown top reposes elbow macaroni bathed in the creamy cheese sauce of your dreams. (another negative, though: no salt and pepper on the table; I would have liked to add pepper to mine, as is my wont with macaroni and cheese -- it would have nicely offset the insanely creamy sauce. Yeah, I could have tried to flag down Mr. Condescension, but by then the mac would have been cold. I'm sure having shakers on the table would ruin the aesthetic, but come on, this is still a restaurant. How about those mini glass cube kind that you get in first class?)Anyway, dessert was another level of decadence. My coworker ordered the brioche donuts (thanks to yelpers, she knew to ask for the fresh raspberry preserves in addition to the standard hot fudge sauce), and I got the vanilla bean milkshake. The shake came in a tall, skinny glass (kind of a skimpy serving, I felt, but then, I suppose I'm more used to the fountain-glass size from Steak 'n' Shake and the like), but the flavor was intensely vanilla-y. So often vanilla shakes are bland and blah, but this really had that vanilla essence to it. It came with a couple of cookies (rugelach and Brussels-type), which were serviceable but nothing special. Frankly, I'd have preferred a larger shake and skip the cookies.I tried the donuts as well, which were warm and sugar-dusted; very tasty, though to me donuts say breakfast more than dessert, I guess. The raspberry preserves were excellent, with a real tang to them (nothing like the sugar-laden store-bought stuff), and the hot fudge sauce was rich and beautifully glossy; I got it all over my hand and couldn't resist licking it off. For some reason the donuts also came with homemade caramel corn, which, while tasty, didn't seem to go with the donuts or the supplementary flavors (hot fudge & raspberry).The food would bring me back to Hot Chocolate, but the self-conscious setting with the dim lights and loud music is a bit of a put-off. One thing I love about Chicago, though: at different points in the meal, people at tables on both sides of us turned to ask about something we'd ordered, and we had friendly little conversations with them. Where I lived before (Dallas), that sort of thing did not happen; you had to pretend you were the only one in the restaurant. So it was kind of fun to mingle in that way (not that you could help it: the tables against the wall were fitted so closely together that you are nearly elbow to elbow with people, so you might as well become friends!)", "Date": "2008-06-14", "Author_Location": "Naperville, IL"}, {"Author": "Gabe M.", "ReviewID": "rDxcw8UQCaInnaJTnji6XA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great example of a place I never would have found if not for someone's suggestion. \u00a0The inside is really cool and comfortable. \u00a0Others started with martinis that they loved. \u00a0Get the mac and cheese. \u00a0Just do it. \u00a0it's a reasonable size for an appetizer. \u00a0It's also the best mac and cheese I've ever had. \u00a0I'm salivating thinking about it. \u00a0Next I had a hamburger, it was so tasty and perfectly cooked. \u00a0To top things off I had a hot chocolate. \u00a0It was good, but too rich for me, I would try another dessert next time - but the hot chocolates are gold for the chocoholics on yelp..Just go to Hot Chocolate - you won't regret it!", "Date": "2009-01-09", "Author_Location": "Whitefish Bay, WI"}, {"Author": "Kevin S.", "ReviewID": "PwN_mjVDNALku5QkLAY3BQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "5 stars for the drinks, 2 stars for the food.The chocolate drinks here are amazing.The food, not so much.

Hot chocolate offers a variety of options from a Crabcake Sandwich to a Beet Salad. We went in during lunch, and the buzz of customers immediately let me know this place was going to be good!Photo Courtesy of Hot Chocolate's Website It's nestled on Damen in the heart of Wicker Park, just a short walk from the Damen/Milwaukee Blue Line. at first glance, it looks like a quaint cafe serving merely breakfast, but this little gem serves beyond that. A fully stocked bar and a phenomenal culinary team make this restaurant perfect for any time of day. It is open for Lunch and Dinner Tuesday - Sunday, and Brunch on the weekends.First, I need to say that I love a restaurant that focuses on local ingredients. Kudos to Chef/Owner Mindy! Our server, Saul, was knowledgeable and on point. Not a single minute went by where I became even remotely close to having an empty drink, which is refreshing (no pun intended) considering I cannot even count on all of my digits the number of times I've gone out to eat and had to crawl across the floor with dehydration (overkill? possibly). But back to Saul...He made small talk, gave us recommendations, and was quite honestly the best server I've had in quite some time.We ordered the Pork Belly Ruben, Macaroni & Cheese (because in Chicago during winter, nothing is better than packing on the pounds to keep warm than some mac & cheese), and the Apple Napoleon for dessert.(PHOTOS COURTESY OF HOT CHOCOLATE'S WEBSITE! Left: Pork Belly Ruben, Right: Mac & Cheese )I have to start with the Mac & Cheese, because Sweet Baby Jesus, it made me want to die. Die in a good way, of course. The texture was so exact... creamy. Not that stick to the roof of your mouth, molten hot lava sh!t you get at most chain 'Italian' restaurants. It displayed a hint of smoked Gruyere and a little American Cheese. Hands down the best mac & cheese I've ever consumed in my 23 years of life. Had my fiance and I not been sharing, I would have probably walked out with eaters remorse and inhaled the whole bowl. The Pork Belly Ruben was definitely a great take on the traditional sandwich. The texture and smokiness of the pork belly paired perfectly the sauerkraut, the bread was perfectly grilled, and just the right hint of what seemed to be caraway or fennel. It is a great portion size and served with home made and thinly sliced potato chips.By time our dessert came, we were overly stuffed from what we had just shoved down our throats (and I say shoved because we barely even breathed in between bites. I think my fiance established a new method of eating which doesn't require him to put down his fork at any point during dining). The Apple Napoleon was a hefty portion for a dessert, but very tasty. Definitely worth the money. Chef Mindy has a James Beard recognition for her pastries, so don't be an idiot and leave without ordering something sweet.I'll definitely be back and explore the menu even further. Next time, I'll actually try a Hot Chocolate (for two reasons... 1) everybody loves hot chocolate and 2) I feel like a fool for eating at a restaurant named 'Hot Chocolate' and not ordering one).On a cliche 'star' rating system, I give this place a 5/5.

My recent visits to Hot Chocolate for brunch have restored my faith in the Chicago dining scene.Yes, this place is small. \u00a0Yes, you will most likely have to wait for a table. \u00a0And, yes, once you approach your table, you will quickly realize that you will be sitting uncomfortably close to the people seated next to you (thus, the one star deduction). \u00a0If you are seated at one of the tables against the left wall of the restaurant, \u00a0you will undoubtedly have to engage in the awkward shimmy to squeeze (and, um, this is a feat even for all 105 pounds of me) past the table next to you to get to your seat. \u00a0You will find yourself apologizing as your butt gets dangerously near your neighbor's plate of pancakes as he/she looks on with disgust. \u00a0The fact that none of this could tarnish my dining experience speaks volume for the quality of the food. \u00a0And, after all, it is the food that matters, right?I've been to Hot Chocolate twice for brunch. \u00a0The first time I had the quiche special of the day, and it instantly converted me into a quiche fanatic (I had always been indifferent to quiche). \u00a0A medley of butternut squash, prosciutto and parmesan cradled in a light, flaky crust, the quiche surprised me with its unique, sharp combination of flavors . \u00a0Since this meal, I've been wanting to return to this place just to try another one of the quiche specials. I also ordered a cup of the Mexican hot chocolate to go. \u00a0Although it was decadently rich and wonderful, I found it a bit too sweet and thick for my tastes. \u00a0Definitely, the hot chocolate here is a dessert in itself. \u00a0I don't see how people eat desserts here AND drink the hot chocolate.My second visit to Hot Chocolate for brunch I was accompanied by my husband. \u00a0We were completely blown away with our dishes. \u00a0My husband had the Brioche French Toast and it was incredible. \u00a0It was divine in its simplicity: cooked to fluffy perfection and dusted lightly with powdered sugar. \u00a0Too many restaurants ruin french toast with indulgently rich toppings: chocolate, peanut butter, whipped cream, mounds of cloyingly sweet canned strawberries. \u00a0The fact that this french toast didn't need any distracting bells or whistles shows the chef's confidence in his work of art. \u00a0It was amazing, and came with a side of organic sausage which was pretty good in its own right.I was torn between ordering the quiche again or ordering a different egg-based dish. \u00a0We asked our waiter what he recommended and he replied that the Fresh Ricotta and Egg sandwich was his favorite. \u00a0Huh? I hadn't even considered it as an option (didn't sound that special to me and I have never ordered a sandwich for brunch). \u00a0But, I decided I needed to step outside of my culinary comfort zone and to take his word for it. \u00a0And the sandwich...was nothing short of amazing. \u00a0The egg was cooked just like I like it (over-medium) and the combination of the creamy ricotta, egg, and tangy roasted tomatoes was heavenly. \u00a0I'm usually not a fan of ciabatta bread but this ciabatta was perfectly toasted and not tough or chewy at all. \u00a0I'm officially a breakfast sandwich convert.The fact that this place is walking distance to our place is the icing on the cake. \u00a0We plan on coming here for brunch as often as our wallets will allow.", "Date": "2009-04-05", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "D J.", "ReviewID": "bu2KZdsKO8_t39wrPsEZCw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Wicker park brunch - check Doing a yelpable Easter Sunday outing - check Orientation misinterpretation - check ;) Went with a girl friend for a late impromptu brunch to the hopping hot spot on the WP restaurant row.

Through some coincidence, one of the parties ahead of us was not there, and we were seated at 5:35, but if we hadn't gotten lucky, they told us it would likely be two hours. Ouch.The moral of the story? Make reservations if you can (they suggested three days in advance). If that's not an option, try calling ahead. Failing that, get there a bit before they open (more than 15 minutes). The food was as good as others have said, and it would be a shame to walk in only to be told they have no tables.Oh, and on a Saturday evening, I did feel a little underdressed in a t-shirt.

Hot Chocolate's hosts and servers are consistently a mess and unprofessional, but somehow they pull off good food and drinks every time and that makes it worthwhile for me. Don't miss out on the Mexican or the Chai Hot Chocolate! Also, fantastic raspberry sponge cake and shortbread cookies, although I'm not sure they are still there. My suggestion is to come for weekday dinner, or an early Saturday brunch/lunch, and \u00a0to call ahead to make sure they are not booked out for private parties. Do NOT come here on a Sunday. I've been here 3 times on Sundays always with problems. The first time, there was a private party which I understand - but there was no sign in the window (or on the valet sign outside). My friend paid to valet-park the car, and we were treated very rudely when we walked in. \u00a0We were pushed out by the hostess who didn't apologize, said we couldn't order anything even to go - and wouldn't tell us when the party was over. Another Sunday afternoon, no private party, so we thought it was a go. However, we were again rudely told that they were not \"open for food\" and we could only order drinks or what was in the case (cookies and brownies). We sat down at a table by the window and the server asked, \"Can you NOT sit at THAT one?\" .... uhhh?? why? so we moved, and we were ignored after we got our cookies from the case. Last Sunday was the last straw. I took my in-laws here and was embarrassed I'd recommended this place. We got there before noon and they were OUT OF BOTH SAUSAGE AND HAM. What kind of \"brunch\" place runs out of those two staples before noon??? Our server came around once every twenty minutes, we waited for ages to get our food, and then she got our order completely wrong. It wasn't even close - steak n eggs v. pancake.

The pork melts in your mouth and goes great with the vinaigrette dressing. We both got sandwiches as entrees (more in the $10-$20 range). I had a spin on the classic grilled cheese and my boyfriend had the lamb sandwich...both of which were good. Be advised, the lamb is quite greasy though.

The server was also very nice and helpful, letting us know which ones to eat in which order and explained the details of each dessert before letting us dig in.

I probably just sit in front of the tv with a pack of those marshmallows and consume it in 10 minutes without even realizing it. As for the hot chocolate mixes- beware: it's not your average hot chocolate mix. There are instructions on the back of the mix to tell you how to make it, but it really does come out thick and you really do need to strain the hot chocolate because the mix is literally chunks of chocolate, and if you leave all the bits in the drink, it gets way too thick and chocolatey, even almost bitter. Anyways, one of the only reasons I marked down a star was because it is on a pretty pricey side, just for dessert. Our order was $24 + tip and tax and my hot chocolate mix was $20 ..

I had one small bite and stopped eating because the roof of my mouth felt raw from the sugar crystals.We also took a box of cookies to go thinking they are the specialty. I had two today and so far nothing has been unique or particularly special. And they are extremely oily. Every Midwestern housewife can whip up these cookies or better.I really expected more given the James Beard Nominations.

Period. There are many ways to enjoy Chicago and as far as good eats and good drinks go, it's debatable that the Chi is the best. I sometimes find myself craving certain dishes from certain places on a regular basis. When I am craving dessert (or my girlfriend is), Hot Chocolate is the place to go!Upon working at one of Chicago's best contemporary restaurants, I heard about the enormous talent of Mindy Segal. She is the chef/owner of Hot Chocolate and is quickly becoming a legend in her own right. Our own pastry chef, Elizabeth Dahl, was creating some seriously incredible desserts at the time...(Note: My favorite all time dessert was by Elizabeth Dahl - Bleu Cheese Cake with Black Walnut Ice Cream, finished with grape consomme and carbonated grapes. Seriously, it's been 2 years and I still remember the sweet savory balance of that incredible dish...you find Ms. Dahl up in WI these days...)Anyways, I have never actually had dinner at Hot Chocolate. It has always been about the dessert (it's almost like going to a steak house and ordering fish). I am sure the food is good, but this is the best place to go for dessert hands down. Mindy Segal has been nominated 5 times for the James Beard award of \"Outstanding Pastry Chef!\" One of these years she will win, but in the meantime I will continue to enjoy the incredible treats she creates!The last time I went, my girlfriend and I had a couple \"hot buttered rums\" while we waited for a table after a Bulls game. If you have 3 of them you will be drunk and probably increase your risk for heart disease by at least 10%. It seems like there is a ton of rum and a stick of butter in each glass! It is worth taking a few years off your life.When we sat down for dessert we didn't know where to start, but decided on the \"Thoughts on a Peanut Butter Cup\" and a bourbon-poached bartlet pear dessert with bruleed Zingermann's cheesecake. I do not even need to go into detail about them, just go into Hot Chocolate! You will not be let down.And guys, if your girlfriend likes desserts take her there tonight!

I didn't even know how much I hated this place until I got home and realized I had spent $75 on 2 bites of dessert and 2 drinks. I first will say, I do not live in the city, especially this area of Wicker Park. While I've been to and enjoyed places that give you the smallest portions on earth, usually those dishes are REMARKABLE, rich and amazing. The $24 chocolate flight was anything but that. Like another reviewer said, they just stick it in front of you and don't explain anything (at least give me the menu back so i can try to figure it out myself) so even if I did particularly enjoy one part of it, I couldn't tell you what it was. It was SO DAMN SMALL that we both barely got one whole bite of any of the items. We also got the banana bread pudding which was nothing like any bread pudding I've ever had (i.e. not great) In fact, my love for bread pudding is the main reason I chose this place! That and it was open late. We also had a beer (overpriced) and some hot \"craft\" cocktail that tasted like weak chocolately coffee with a tiny bit of liquor thrown in. It took the bartender like 17 minutes to make it, so I assumed it was going to be a lot better than it was for 11 or 12 bucks. *EDIT* I forgot, we did also have a scoop of the peanut butter and jelly gelato which was admittedly very good, but again baby-sized and probably 6 bucks. On top of that, the staff don't seem to really give a shit. We made an open table reservation and after calling and telling them our dinner was running long and we'd be late, they proceeded to put us down as a no-show. Then when we arrived, our rez had been cancelled (wasn't too busy luckily) and the host gave us the teensiest tiniest table (I'm 5'11, my husband is 6'4\" we're not petite) so we moved to the bar and she gave us the huffiest dirty look. Excuuuuse me! The bartenders were just alright. Since we were in late, they seemed more concerned with their cleaning/closing duties.I really don't usually consider myself a food snob, and if something is above and beyond, like I was expecting, the money part isn't even that much of an issue. Maybe how NOT superb I thought it was is directly related to how insanely over priced (and overrated on yelp) it is.

I ordered a glass of wine within 5 minutes of being seated and it took another 10-15 minutes to come. I knew this was a bad sign and I was correct. The service was wholly impersonal and distracted. Our server always had his attention on his other tables when he was with us. He seemed to have more tables than he could efficiently handle. Everything took 10-15 minutes longer than usual. From the initial drink order until the check finally came, I was perpetually wondering what was taking so long.A $120 meal, should have been and usually is so much better. I will not go back.p.s.

They boast local ingredients and sustainable farming distributers if you're into that kind if thing, but most importantly, their food is delicious. The decor is totally romantic - dark wood, dim lights, candles on the table and lots of wine bottles in shelving behind the bar. The tables are very close to each other, lending it a bit of a European feel that some might find cramped but which I find enchanting.We both ordered a glass of fruity Cabernet and opted for the biscuits and honey butter as an appetizer. We got six tiny, flavorful biscuits that went absolutely perfectly with the pot of butter and honey that came with it. As a main course, I had the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had (which is saying something because mac'n'cheese is one of my hands down favorite foods) which was just as tasty cold, hours later, when we were hungrily waiting in line to see Too Much Light at the NeoFuturists theater. My boyfriend had sweet potato ravioli with pork cheek that he let me get a taste of. The ravioli were perfect and the pork cheek was so tender and delicious.We couldn't leave without getting dessert, so we had one off the seasonal menu. The pecan pie with pumpkin cheesecake and ice cream was decadent and delicate and was the perfect portion size for us to share without feeling too gluttonous.All in all, I would highly recommend this place.

I have made many attempts to visit this place, but I had failed until January 2nd, 2010. What a way to start the new year! Hot Chocolate was everything I expected it to be and more.Located in the Bucktown neighborhood, Hot Chocolate is located near some pretty great stores, including Marc Jacobs, and the notable T-shirt Deli. The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming, but when you pass by the window, the warm atmosphere is enough to draw any passersby inside.I was joined by my boyfriend and our friend Mike for my inaugural visit. We were seated in the center of the restaurant, giving us views of the bar, the kitchen, and the other diners. Because we made our reservations at the last minute, we had an early dinner at 5pm, but Hot Chocolate was already bustling.Three Sister's Stone Ground Cornmeal and Buttermilk Biscuits - served warm with house-made butter seasoned with sea salt and fresh local honey. These biscuits were (OMG) the best thing I ate that night. Mmmmmmm, biscuits. Surprisingly sweet and crunchy, these were served with a volcano of freshly-made butter erupting with delicious local honey. I might have slathered a more than average amount of this delicious goo onto each of my share of the biscuits! These disappeared too quickly for my taste - I could have eaten a basked full of these little guys!Hamburger - house-ground Heartland beef, organic bacon and Widmer 4-year aged cheddar, house-made pickles on a garlic-toasted bun. Can we just take a moment and look at this burger? Let's evaluate the description alone: House-ground Heartland beef (why would anyone every eat anything but?); organic bacon (bacon at it's purest); 4-year aged cheddar (ok, aged cheddar is my favorite of all cheeses to start with, and now you're putting it on top of house-ground burger and organic bacon? sweet jebus!); house-made pickles (I'll never eat a vlasic again); garlic-toasted bun (yes please!).You'd think from my description of this meal (and we didn't even get to the amazing cole slaw or the russet potato chips) that I would have ordered the burger, but I did not! I actually got the tuna melt, which was delicious in its own right. My boyfriend, Josh, got the burger. And he said, \"It was the best bun-to-meat-to-bacon-to-cheese ratio I've ever had. It's the best burger I've had in Chicago.\" Take that, burger bars!Chocolate \u00a0#1(64%) - warm chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart, salted caramel ice cream and housemade pretzel. The tart was delicious and the caramel ice cream did not disappoint either! To top everything off, the housemade pretzel was extremely light and crispy- a perfect compliment.Overall, Hot Chocolate was a very fun place to enjoy our Saturday evening meal. The atmosphere was a combination of coffee house meets stylish restaurant. The lighting was the perfect amount of dim, and the service was excellent.Check out Hot Chocolate - especially those biscuits!Check out my blog for pictures: breeeatschicago.wordpres\u2026", "Date": "2010-01-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Foram B.", "ReviewID": "KPN6JXSRmsxeeuplqk338w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been to Hot Chocolate a couple times now in the evening.

I don't want an attitude from a snotty hipster hostess making $8 per hour. I want to be greeted warmly and not feel like I am bothering you - especially when we are your first table of the day. When I dine out, of course I want good food and a comfortable atmosphere - that's a given. But what matters more to me? I want to know that I am valued as a customer and that you want me to come back and bring my friends. Such is the case with my eagerly-anticipated visit for brunch today with my Dessert Club members in tow. The Club gets together once per month and the host bakes a kickass dessert from scratch, but a couple of times per year we pick a restaurant for brunch that someone highly recommends. After my previous review, my friends were excited to see if HC lived up to its hype. I can safely say that most of us will not be coming back.1. \u00a0When I called Hot Chocolate a few weeks ago about making a reservation for 9 peeps for brunch (open from 10 am to 2 pm), I had to give my credit card. I realize this is a new trend but you are not Alinea or The Everest Room.2. \u00a0When I told HC on Friday that we would now be a party of 7, they said \"sorry - then you can't reserve the table. We only have 1 large table and it has to be at least 8 - and we only book it once at 10 am and once at noon.\" \u00a0There was a chance our 8th was going to attend but I couldn't chance it as they had my VISA # - would they have refused to seat us or charge me for the missing 8th person?So I cancelled the reservation and said we will take our chances with the 7 of us showing up when the doors opened at 10 am. 3. \u00a0Four of us arrived at 9:55 am and, as it was 10 degrees outside, one of our members went to HC's front door which was open. When she walked in, she was met by the hostess-who-needs-an-attitude-adjustment who pointed out to the street chalkboard sign and said \"we don't open until 10 am.\" THEN KEEP YOUR EFFING DOORS LOCKED UNTIL 10 AM!!4. At 10 am, my friends went inside where they were met with \"we can't seat you until the other 2 arrive\" - my friends called me - I said we had parked, and were about 100 yards away.5. We were still missing 1 person - but as HC puts the fear of Yahweh in you about everyone being there, we decided to just say \"just seat us as 6.\" About 5 mins later, our 7th arrived and we managed to squeeze her in at our round table - which was conveniently located about 3 feet from the mens room.What was the best part of this whole experience? Our server Laura. I had her as a server my initial visit and let me tell you that if I were you, having been a server myself years ago, I would ask to be in her section when you arrive. She is charming, attentive, accommodating and sympathetic. We took her advice on what items to order - the quiche, the warm doughnuts, the tuna melt, the buttermilk biscuit with eggs and sausage patty, the assorted hot chocolates, the fresh ricotta and egg sandwich. The food is good - the environment is loud, loud, loud as by 11:00 the place was mobbed - the hot chocolate is to die for. I do expect more than 3 or 4 quarter-sized fried potatoes with my entree. Why bother - are they for show? For a regular coffee, biscuit sandwich, a hot chocolate, sharing of an order of the daily fresh baked \"Sweets\" for the table (and a generous tip for Laura) , I paid $31. Rather hefty for brunch, IMO.To summarize, there are plenty of restaurants with average, mediocre food and ambiance that I continue to patronize because they value their customers. I don't expect a \"Check, Please\" epiphany every time I dine out. But off-putting rules and the bad attitudes of your help will get you nowhere no matter how good the food is.One more thing, give Laura a raise.", "Date": "2009-01-25", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Bambi M.", "ReviewID": "9SSTbvufSy9tO6yYdAu85Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't believe I've never reviewed...been hear countless times.

I was hoping one of them would come over and ask if I wanted a cocktail, a glass of wine or even water; but that didn't happen.As for the food, started with the mussels, my son claimed there was mussel poop in his (I think he was right, but I didn't want to tell him that at the table, ewww) His burger was overcooked , I told our server medium w/ a pink center, it was medium well. My swordfish was swimming in butter, however I did enjoy the cauliflower side. He's a huge stat guy (years of baseball). He said our dining experience average was .181.

For some reason I had conjured a vision of this being less of a restaurant and more of a hot chocolate cafe with lots of families and children. Walking in Hot Chocolate appeared to be a nice, romantic adult venue. The lighting is dim and the large open rectangular room has lots of brown undertones, providing a vague feeling of being inside a giant chocolate bar. The only negative of the ambiance was the tables are extremely close together; while this is common in Chicago, this was a bit to the extreme and getting in and out of my seat reminded me of having to squeeze out of a window seat while flying coach on an airplane. Hot Chocolate is renowned for their desserts, with chef/owner Mindy Segal having earned multiple James Beard nominations for outstanding pasty chef. However they have a nice, albeit somewhat limited dinner menu with a handful of apps, a few salads, a few sandwiches and a few mains. My wife and I started with the house-made pretzels with cheese/mustard/beer sauce and also a cheese board. The pretzels were decent, but at $13 were grossly overpriced. The cheeses (selection of three, also $13) were a better value. They included a triple cream, a goat cheese and a blue cheese along with honey drizzled bread, some poached fruit, a jam and a small salad with a few spiced nuts. For our mains my wife went with the vegetable risotto and I opted for the pan roasted trout with black bean puree and an avocado, grapefruit and fennel salad. My trout was fairly tasty, but was a bid odd in that it had uneven flavors; I am not sure if some parts were cooked more fully or if the seasoning was not well distributed but some bites I loved, over bites did not taste so good. My wife was very pleased with her risotto and I took a few bites and also enjoyed her dish. Portions were fairly generous and the prices reasonable (low to mid $20s). Hot Chocolate also has a long bar across on side of the space and has a limited wine list, several craft beers and a handful of cocktails. My wife ordered a glass of cava and I started with the Hot Buttered Rum. I was expecting this to be mainly heated up rum with some spices but it almost seemed to have a milk shake like consistency that I did not find pleasant; it was far more rich than I had expected and caused me to start filling up too early on in the meal. This should have been classified as a dessert beverage rather than a cocktail. There are more than ten desserts to choose from, all priced at $12. My wife and I both desired the same dish (chocolate souffle tart with salted caramel ice cream) and decided to share this as we were feeling rather satiated already. The server cautioned that it was portioned for one, but we found the tart to be fairly large and it was so rich we actually struggled to finish the tart. I also ordered a hot chocolate with dessert and my wife a coffee that was served in a small French press. There are also several options for hot chocolate and I opted for one of the more plain choices, the \"medium\" which is mainly milk chocolate with a touch of dark chocolate and some caramel. It was served with a large homemade marshmallow on the side. The first couple of sips were good, but like the tart I found the hot chocolate to be overly rich for my taste and was not able to finish it as I started to feel bloated. My wife found the coffee to be fair. Hot Chocolate is a decent venue and despite arriving before 6:00pm it was already crowded and became completely full by the end of our meal (they do now accept Open Table reservations, and I definitely recommend making ressies if dining here). Unfortunately we had been expecting an amazing meal and Hot Chocolate fell well short of this mark; I have the following criticisms:*The tables are way too close together, to the point of being awkward. *Service was a bit subpar; our server took quite some time to check on us after our appetizers were delivered (and unfortunately there was a small issue that needed to be corrected before we could consume them). Also we were served a bottle of water, but this was never poured for us and when we ran out of water, no additional water was ever brought out. Nobody assisted in pulling out our table as we were seated (without doing so it was not possible to sit without bumping the adjacent table). *The food is a bit overpriced; while it is pretty good, our meal cost $127 before tip for two cocktails, two appetizers, two mains, one dessert, one coffee and one hot chocolate. Plenty of venues in Chicago have food this good or better for less. Fortunately we had a Restaurant.com coupon that knocked $25 off the tab. *Some of the food is overly rich; portions need to be much smaller on these items or the richness mellowed out; otherwise it become uncomfortable to eat a full meal here.", "Date": "2012-01-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "maeve P.", "ReviewID": "LdT44JlD6_OVkQiBnI5n8g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh wow this place is tast-eee!

If you're not a meat/fish eater (like me) you'll have a hard time finding something. \u00a0I believe I had a salad and soup, which was possibly corn chowder (it was over a year ago, so I don't really remember). \u00a0I do remember that whatever it was, it was delicious. \u00a0The boyfriend had a tuna salad sandwich, which was great ( I occasionally dabble in tuna). Brunch, however, was fantastic on both visits. The brioche donuts are light and soft and come with a chocolate dipping sauce, the french toast with plumped cherries and whipped cream was not too sweet- which was a relief after the uber-rich Mexican hot chocolate I had to start. \u00a0I have found the waitstaff to be friendly and attentive without being pushy. \u00a0When my friend and I arrived at around noon today the place was PACKED, and to make the wait a little easier they had set up a carafe of coffee for self-service, which I thought was a nice gesture. \u00a0The brunch is just as pricey as the rest of the menu (my french toast was $10) but the portions are decent and everything is really tasty. \u00a0So skip Bongo Room for one weekend, and give it a try.UPDATE: The boyfriend and I took my sister, a new mom-to-be, to HoCho for her first ever Mother's Day Brunch (she was visiting from out of town so her husband wasn't there). With no reservation, we tried to get there right at 10 to skip the crowd- no such luck. \u00a0Mindy Segal was hostessing herself, and quoted us an hour wait. We decided to saddle up with some hot chocolate and wait it out. \u00a0Even though we did wait a full hour, the fact that they had put out complimentary coffee AND croissants made the wait a lot easier. \u00a0And as a parting treat for the moms (including my sister), each got a little pack of 2 heart-shaped cookies with 'Mom' written on them. \u00a0It's those little touches that really make the customers feel welcome and cared for, and not like just another credit card.

The food for dinner is pretty good but with a name like \"Hot Chocolate\" you have to know that the desserts are the star.

I wanted the roast chicken with the sweet potato salad and chanterelle mushrooms (the God of fungi) but it would take roughly 45 minutes to whip that up and mama was just too darn hungry for that. Nice that they roast to order but I wanted to save room for dessert (obvi) so appetizers were out. I needed noms and I needed them quickly. So I got the burger instead. Yes! Meat! It was good. perfectly medium and juicy (maybe a little too juicy...might have needed a bib), with cheddar and organic bacon. MMM, that's tasty. House made potato chips were a'ight. Not quite salty enough for my tastes but I'd take a salt lick for dinner if I could. Coleslaw was great and I don't even LIKE coleslaw so I give them credit for that. Pickles. House made! Crispy and with a bit of a mustardy bite. Liked it. Also love that most of their ingredients are procured from local farms and organic when possible. Thumbs up from this green thumb.DESSERT. Ok, so. Everything sounded amazing. Chocolate number 1 is the usual standby (warm chocolate souffle with salted caramel ice cream and a pretzel) but I wanted something MORE. The warm brioche doughnuts are always a good bet but again...I needed MORE. The seasonal offerings sounded great and oh so very tempting but in the end I just wanted chocolate. And lots of it. Warm, dark and rich. My choice then was clear. I had to go with the eponymous offering--the dark (72%) cup of hot chocolate. Ohemzgee. Holy chocolate soup, batman! Served with a spoon and a house made marshmallow. So thick, so rich, and just the right level of not so sweet. Perfect perfect perfect. It was a little too rich to finish the whole cup so I got the rest to go and it kept wonderfully in my fridge for a little boost the next morning. As if that wasn't enough sugar--my friend and I just had to try the cookies staring at us from behind the glass counter by the front door.

Simple cookies like chocolate chip, gingersnap sandwiches filled with butter cream, shortbread, etc., but so buttery and delicious. I can't. I just...can't. Stop that is.Mindy Segal: Heaven called.

the place was deafening and our options for seating included the lounge or \"about an hour for a table.\"With a quick glance to the ladies and a brief browsing of the depleted pastry case we elected for the lounge not only because it seemed quite and comfortable, but also because the clock was pushing 10:00pm and we'd not yet even checked into our hotel and without hesitation we were led to a cozy corner with long leather benches and appropriately low lying tables complete with silverware, candles, and water glasses that were filled without hesitation. \u00a0Greeted next by our server, Laura K, we were asked if we'd ever visited before and on stating we had not she explained to us that each \"dessert\" was generally composed of two to three different items and we were left to decide - a process that took no time at all as we'd already researched the online menu en route to Chicago.With orders placed and service appropriate but largely separated from the lounge throughout the evening the first item to arrive was a prerequisite given the restaurant's name and although not quite as transcendent as that at Jacques Genin or LA Burdick the Black and Tan Hot Chocolate made of 1/3 hot fudge and 2/3 medium cocoa hot chocolate was certainly rich, creamy, and entirely too much for one person (especially after a full day of eating.) \u00a0Sharing it around the three of us it was interesting to hear different impressions - all positive, but each catching different notes in the chocolate from vanilla to honey to fruit.Moving on to the proper desserts - each priced at $11 - my mother's choice was the restaurant's signature \"Chocolate \u00a0#1(64%)\" \u00a0featuring a warm chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart topped with salted caramel ice cream and a tuille of housemade pretzel; an exercise in balance and every bit worthy of its acclaim. \u00a0Beginning first with the tart - hot, molten, and bitter - sure the concept of a lava cake is played, but as long as it made with great care and better chocolate it really doesn't matter, especially when it is matched with extra sweet yet subtly saline ice cream and a crunchy salty sourdough pretzel for texture.Moving on to my dessert, a seasonal option titled \"My Honey Pie\" and featuring \"warm and luscious honey pie with honey-roasted peanuts, honey caramel, berry-rose syrup, graham cracker and 'PB&J' Ice Cream Sandwich this dish was another winner, but a case where one less ingredient could have been more. \u00a0Beginning first with the pie - I love honey, I love peanuts, and I love caramel so it is needless to say that the warm gooey amalgam poured inside a thick buttery graham cracker shell had 'had me at hello' even before Segal crash landed a peanut butter and grape jelly ice cream sandwich directly into it. \u00a0Already with a lot going on - fruit, honey, sweet, savory, hot, cold, gooey, and crunchy - the unfortunate aspect of this dish was not knowing when to quit, specifically in reference to the cloyingly sweet syrup whose perfume did nothing but distract from the pie's nuance even though it was present in only a small quantity.For the final dessert, my aunt's \"O'Dan-A-Banana\" featuring a 'nilla puddin' \u00a0icebox cake with 'nilla wafers, cocoa nib ganache, vanilla bean pudding, bananas foster sauce, and a chocolate phosphate was everything I'd hoped for when planning to visit Hot Chocolate and then some. \u00a0Beginning first with the phosphate - it was a textbook old school chocolate soda with a bit of extra thickness from the cream and although sweet the slight sour from the phosphate proved a perfect foil to the other half of the plate; a cake that would have been more appropriately described as a horizontal mille-feuille with alternating layers of thick banana pudding diving crispy house made wafers doused with caramelized banana chunks in a hot boozy sauce plus a bit of extra chocolate for good measure.With the bill paid and people still continuing to file in even as we exited the restaurant around 10:30 we thanked our server and again made our way to the street where a short drive would land us at our hotel exhausted, full, and happy to have experienced Segal's intriguing concoctions even though not all were perfect and despite the fact that our ears were still ringing as though we'd just been to a concert as opposed to a restaurant (okay, slight exaggeration.) \u00a0That said, having now experienced the scene at night I'd definitely not hesitate to return for brunch to see the savory side of the menu.", "Date": "2011-07-21", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Erika F.", "ReviewID": "E9wmvIqBYZV5nKURyvXswQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HORRIBLE SERVICE!

I didn't realize that a restaurant named hot chocolate would be so good. On a recent date night, we found ourselves at this romantic dimly lit restaurant. I didn't realize that this restaurant was featured on Martha Stewart show until after our dinner. Make sure you get reservations because restaurant seating is limited during dinner hours. Just as others commented, the tables are placed ridiculously close together where you have to shift the other table to squeeze into the booth seating. Our dinner entree was the burger (heartland beef, organic bacon, widmer 4 year aged cheddar and garlic toasted bun with fried farm egg). I can't say that it was the best burger I have ever had, but it was tasty/greasy. The fried egg is the perfect topper for the burger. I personally loved the lamb and krema kasa (sourdough flatbred with lamb sausage, carr valley krema kasa cheese, and wild arugula oregano oil). There was a certain gaminess tempered by the cheese which made for a unique taste that you have to experience. The only down side was the oregano oil made this also very oily to handle.The best part of the meal was to come.... dessert!- warm brioche doughnuts with hot fudge. The only complaint I have about this dessert was the lack of \"doughnut\" shape in the dessert. The brioche was served in stick form similar to lady fingers which you could dip into the hot fudge. All I can say is yum!- Chocolate #1 (warm chocolate souffle tart, salted caramel ice cream and house made pretzel) This was an above average dessert, not quite a souffle, but more on the tart side with a soft souffle tart. The salted caramel ice cream was exactly as described. The pretzel was another downer as it was a pretzel stick not even formed into the pretzel shape like online. All and all still good, maybe my expectations for this was too high.Pro- lamb and krema kasa delicious!, romantic atmosphere, brioche doughnuts with hot fudge enough saidCon- cramped seating arrangement, long wait time with no reservation, priceyHidden deal- During peak times, they reserve an area for dessert only customers.

I understand from years of serving that it can be tough when all of the party does not arrive at the same time.

Didn't notice empty drinks either. Not a fan.3. Everything was stupid salty. 4. Butternut Squash Soup (daily special), just didn't taste right. Super thick but had garnishes that really didn't pair well with the soup. Also salty. Green beans were slathered in this ranch type dressing that didn't do it for us. Also, tasted kind of blanched, but kind of cooked, so it didn't have the crunch I was looking for in a cold green bean salad. The bacon on it was good, but overly large and also neither hot nor cold. 5. Tuna Melt was the biggest meh ever. It barely had any tuna on it, just lots of bread and lots of cheese. The tuna I did get was fine enough, but unremarkable. The capers did a lot to cover up the lack of anything. The arugala salad (on the side) was luke warm, tasted like the greens hadn't been washed, and unevenly dressed. SO's chicken was nicely fried (had excellent rosemary crusted skin), but the potatoes on the plate were extremely salty (especially considering the salt on the skin). Also, he had the green beans as an app (we didn't split), and his chicken came with green beans. He thought it was a major service oversight to not point out that his entree had the same vegetable as his app/salad (this wasn't mentioned on the menu to my knowledge).6. The donuts were schmea. They weren't cakey enough to me and weren't dusted with enough cinnamon. Also weren't as warm as I'd prefer. Had more of a dunkin donuts texture and quality than a fancy restaurant quality. I'm not terrible sure they were fried to order and definitely tasted pre-made and then baked or re-heated.

I know. He is the type of guy who scrapes off all the frosting from his cupcake, tosses the frosting into the trash, and then eats his naked cupcake. He might as well have just eaten a muffin instead.But. This place made him fall in love with dessert. We were there last night and despite finishing his entire medium rare steak for dinner, while in the middle of our dessert, he commented that he had plenty of room left in his stomach for the dessert we were having. Usually, he would tell me that he has no room for dessert and would just eat a bite or two of our shared dessert just to please me. But not last night. We each got our own dessert. They were having a rhubarb special which came with 6 different mini dessert courses at $20 per person. Each item came in a tasting portion: rhubarb cocktail, rhubarb galette, red velvet cupcake with rhubarb cream cheese, risotto with rhubarb jam, rhubarb+lemon curd, rhubarb+vanilla sorbet. Very unique dessert concoctions and the resulting taste and execution were excellent. Most importantly, the desserts were not too sweet. My husband finished his dessert before me. Usually he would be struggling to finish his dessert. Since this place specializes in dessert, we were not sure how the entrees would fare but they were definitely of good standard. I ordered the whole grilled fish, yes, it was served whole with the head and tail. And I loved it. The skin was charred until crispy and the fish inside was so moist and flavorful. I polished it clean. While many people prefer to eat their fish in fillet form, I give Hot Chocolate credit for being brave in offering the fish in whole form. The grilled fish was served in a purist way with some fresh cilantro, dill, shaved fennel, and capers over the grilled fish. Nothing else. Just like the way Jamie Oliver would do it. My husband's steak was prepared was prepared medium rare just as requested and it was done just right- not over or under cooked.This was our first time at Hot Chocolate and having read previous reviews and after hearing our friends tell us about this place, it did seem that this place was once a romantic and dimly lit place. However, this place just reopened after being closed for remodeling and the revamped Hot Chocolate that we went to last night is now a rustic and a little grunge place.

So, that's where I made the boy take me.We each started with a shake. Yes, they come in very skinny glasses, but I was glad because I didn't want it to fill me up too much. Also, they come with two cookies on the side, which: awesome. Steve got the chocolate banana shake (good) and I had the chocolate peanut butter (AMAZING). For an appetizer, we had the homemade pretzels, which were fabulous enough alone, but the cheese dipping sauce was so good I wanted to cry.For the entree, I had the mac and cheese and a side of the cauliflower gratin. The mac and cheese comes in a tiny dish but it is REALLY filling, and also really really good. Like I've said before, I am a mac and cheese SNOB, and I loved this stuff. I only ate half of it so that I'd have room for dessert, and the other half reheated very well the next day. The cauliflower gratin was very good too, although not as cheesy as one might hope. The boy had a burger, which was good but a little salty. The accompanying coleslaw and chips were both really good.The moment I had been waiting for was dessert, but I was surprised by the fact that I liked Steve's better than mine. I had been literally DREAMING about the chocolate souffle with salted caramel ice cream, which is what I ordered. The souffle part was good, but not very souffle-esque, which disappointed me. It was really more like a combination of a tart/flourless cake. The salted caramel ice cream, however was TO. DIE. FOR. I haven't had that since I was in Europe and it brought back a lot of memories.

At around 8:40 the man who would be our waiter came by and told us that they would buy us a round of drinks or an appetizer as an apology for our table not being available, which was very very nice of them, and we were totally understanding, so it was a nice gesture. All three of us ended up getting the Hot Buttered Rum, which was DELICIOUS. Seriously, it's worth the price for this cocktail. We kept looking at each other and going \"OH MY GOD THIS IS SO GOOD\" after every single sip. It's rum, handmade butterscotch, boiling water, whipped cream, cinnamon, nutmeg, and maybe one or two other things I forgot. Perfect on a freezing winter day. I think we got seated around 8:50 or 9:00. Our waiter, who I think was named Sonny (I didn't quite catch it) was probably the best server I've ever had! He was just so nice and knowledgeable, and really made us feel special. He mentioned that he has been working for the restaurant ever since it opened 8 years ago, so it's no wonder that he knew what he was doing. We made the mistake/awesome decision of each ordering a hot chocolate AND dessert on top of our already rich cocktail. I got the Mexican hot chocolate, which was very good, dark, and rich. The cinnamon and cayenne gave it an almost peanut buttery taste to me, which was weird but good. My friend got the cacao nib hot chocolate, which tasted caramely and soooo good. These hot chocolates are a dessert in their own right, which we didn't realize. They are SO rich, it's like chocolate soup. I also got the banana bread pudding, which I only got to have about 3 bites of before I felt like i was going to burst (we had also had dinner about an hour before so we were already full) but nevertheless was very banana-y, rich, and delicious. I boxed most of it up to take home with me. My friend got the donuts, which I took a bite of, and they were excellent dipped in the hot chocolate. My friend whose birthday it was ordered the chocolate and honey souffle, which I did not taste, but it looked good, and they wrote Happy Birthday on her plate in chocolate and placed a candle on the plate, which was really cute and was a nice touch.

I actually enjoyed the burger from Hot Chocolate more than the #1 ranked burger at Prairie Grass Cafe. The main reason for this is that HC focuses more on the burger, while Prairie Grass places a hefty amount of blue cheese on top of theirs. Just a side note, the Prairie burger is still outstanding (See my review), but I just felt like the burger didn't shine as much as it should have.OK, now onto HC. Cool atmosphere, nice wait staff, and decent drink menu. We had the Mac'N Cheese as an appetizer, and it was amazing. It looks a little watery, but fear not, its one of the best you'll ever have... very good cheddar cheese must have been used. We each obviously \u00a0got the burger with the fried egg, and it was great. Perfectly cooked, simple accompaniments, and great flavor. They do char their burgers over an open flame, and I will admit that, if you do not like a very \"charred\" taste, this burger may not be fore you. The fried egg is a great addition to the burger, and I promise it was an organic egg, the yolk was too creamy for it not to be. My only knock against the burger was the fries.... or lack thereof, HC serves Potato chips, and while they are tasty, I want some fries with my burger. We also had dessert, and as I'm sure most of my reviews show that, I am not a dessert guy, but that's what HC is known for so... \"When in Rome.\" We chose the Chocolate Dish and the Banana Bread Pudding, both were quit good, but the Banana Bread Pudding was absolutely outstanding....

At 7:25, we called them to ask how things were looking, and they said it would still be another 20 or 30 minutes & that they'd call when they were ready for us. \u00a0By 8 pm, we decided we ought to head back to Hot Choc to wait in person, thinking the remainder of the wait would probably be a short one and that we might be experiencing some kind of \"out of sight, out of mind\" effect.This is where things get ugly. We gave the hostess our name and she said, very matter-of-fact, \"OK, here's what's going on,\" and proceeded to explain that the kitchen had been particularly slow that night, that tables hadn't been turning over as quickly as she'd thought they would, and that realistically, our wait would probably be about another 90 minutes. \u00a0(NINETY MINUTES on top of the 90 minutes we'd already waited.

The server wandered over to out table and just stood there looking at us, but did not tell us her name or anything. Just a small \"hi.\" It was pretty strange. As a former server/cocktail waitress, I finally broke the silence by asking what the specials were, what we wanted to drink and so on.

However, what we got was a far cry from that. All the syrup in the world could not make this FT any softer. The duck hash was delicious and had quite a zing to it with a little help from some cayenne pepper. We were at least satisfied with that part of the meal.We also ordered hot chocolate but asked if they could do half espresso and the other half our desired hot chocolate flavors, which they did perfectly. I had the Medium which was a rich, caramel-y drink and Mom had the Mexican hot chocolate pairing with espresso.

We had the cheese plate which was kind of disappointing, but not terribly bad. The cheese was good, the bread wasn't warm like advertised, the fresh-baked crackers could have been...better, they looked more like oatmeal cookies. The hot chocolate was okay. My friends had the chai chocolate, mexican chocolate (which was extremely dark), and the medium (even that wasn't as sweet as I would have expected). I had the vanilla bean butterscotch and it was way too sweet. I couldn't taste any vanilla, just sweet sweet butterscotch. It was good for the first few sips but then it was too much. If only they had something in between the sweet sweet vanillabean butterscotch and the really dark and bitter..others. BUT we had the mac and cheese and it was REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY good. The cookies weren't anything spectacular either. It was a nice experience, would have expected higher quality food and a more milk chocolate version of hot chocolate to please those of us who are not huge fans of dark chocolate. The ambience is awesome but it was a bit TOO dark where we were sitting near the hostess stand, the little candle on the table was the only light we had, we could hardly see our food. And then with the door opening, the flame went out..so we basically we had no light in the immediate vicinity. Also, the busboy brought out what looked like a votive candle-holder instead of a glass for water for one person in my party, weird.

We had a party of four and we sat at the lounge area in the front for drinks. It took over a half hour to get a drink order, and they brought the wrong beer for one person in the party. An hour an 45 mins later I checked on our status and the hostess pointed to a table and said that the they had their check so we should be seated soon - in a few minutes they seated a different party that came in after us at that very table she referred to. In fact they seated at least three other parties that arrived after us (all parties of 4) before we were seated. The drink server said those groups may have had reservations - Wait?? I was told they don't take reservations? And if those parties did have special reservations, why did they wait over an hour in the lounge with us?

What can I say?Well, let's start with the obvious....dating beautiful and intelligent people...I've said it before and will say it again...it's kind of difficult sometimes.Let's paint a picture....*Ambience: Loud, tables crowded close together....busy busy busy place. Empty your bladder before you sit down. You'll get dirty looks if you try to get up.*Wait: Tuesday night....we made no reservations...we waited 45 minutes. Passed the time with a pleasant and very honest waiter (what a great surprise)...ordered a specialty whiskey drink and the lady ordered a glass of wine. My drink was amazing...a little tart but I liked it, especially with fresh apple slices and a lemon slice inside.*Expectations: They were slammed! So I figured with the fact we were cheapos with a coupon and that they were so busy, my experience would be lacking.Food Breakdown:2 glasses of wine2 glasses of the whiskey specialty drink (I keep forgetting what it's called)1 Shrimp and Grits Appetizer - Tiger Shrimp...3 shrimp and they were huge. The grits were not the typical southern style but they were infused with mushrooms and a mushroom flavored sauce. Fantastic.1 Pork Belly & Bay Scallop Salad - The lady loved the pork belly...and the scallops were very small. However, it was delicious and the dressing they put on the greens was ah-mazing.1 Kobe Filet - I ordered it medium rare...side note: *Medium rare is the only way to order good quality meat!* For me...you can pretty much butcher the cow and then slap the newly skinned meat on a plate for me....ok...moving on. The waitress was kind enough to tell me she was going to tell the cooks to make it as rare as they could without the meat being cold. And wow...did she deliver. It was great. Every bite was like a little tiny burst of mouth-gasmic flavor on the tip of my tongue. The greens and the potatoes served on the side were delicious as well...but they didn't hold a candle to my steak... 1 Pork Chop - The lady ordered this. I didn't try it but she said it was really good minus the fact that the meat was a bit fatty...she doesn't seem to understand the fat is necessary to flavor the meat (at least in my mind). Oh, those healthy eaters...when will they learn?1 Peanut Butter Cup dessert - I did not try but the lady ordered this and she can't have dairy, nor will she eat sweets regularly. Despite this, she loved it...to me, it looked like a fancy peanut butter cup...if I wasn't struggling to finish my dessert, I would have tried some. It looked beautiful and tasty.1 Mexican Hot Chocolate - This was the entire reason why I wanted to come here in the first place. Lovely dark hot chocolate with a homemade marshmallow and a spicy aftertaste. Need I say more? Nope....that's about it. I was just upset I was so stuffed and full it was hard to enjoy this. I was in pain from eating so much...but I triumphed and managed to have enough room for this!*Bill: I brought a $25 coupon. So my bill was $155 including a 20% tip off the original amount. So had I not gotten a coupon, I would have dropped $180ish. Not bad...yes, I'm a huge cheapskate but it was worth it. I haven't had such a nice meal in a while due to my cheapness. Definitely will only come here for a splurge from now on...for dinner anyway...the brunch prices aren't as scary. *Service: Ok, back to my original statement...so hard dating beautiful and intelligent people...I think our server had a little crush on my lady. She kept speaking to mostly her...that or I'm just that crazy jealous girlfriend (I mean, that's totally possible...but I've learned to accept it). However, the lady kept saying the waitress was hitting on me...haha no. I wasn't told I was beautiful and loved. \u00a0My lady got the bill though I was the one paying. Ahem, when you have a table consisting of a lesbian couple, they're both equally capable of paying. So suck up to both. The service was excellent though, both at our table and getting drinks in the waiting area before dinner. I was highly impressed due to the fact that when we walked in, they were slammed and the hostess told me, very flustered, that they were booked solid. Next time, I'm making reservations for sure.Verdict: I would come back with a date for a nice dinner, when I'm single to treat myself to a nice dinner, and for brunch with some friends who'd like to be trendy. Also, the hot chocolate is going on sell...no more Swiss Miss for me! I will totally purchase and drink it at my house when I'm too poor to go out in the dead of winter due to ridiculously high gas bills.", "Date": "2009-12-30", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Laura K.", "ReviewID": "7pCoqBvKo80pGpUj0u_J5A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything was so tasty!

We started with the mussels which piqued my interest after I read that they were stewed in a cream sauce among which PBR was one of the ingredients. PBR- the cheap hipster swill that is called \"beer\" by many denizens of chicago. If it was in the dish I certainly couldn't tell which was probably a good thing as it was delicious beyond belief. I accidently paired it with the best manhattan I've ever had. Super balanced and just strong enough to have me feeling really nice after my second one. Up until this meal I had thought that Duchamp had the best manhattan. We also had the Arctic Char and the burger which came highly recommended. Wasn't a fan of the burger though the homemade pickles were stellar. If you want a fantastic burger go check out Old Oak Tap. Still have yet to find anything that compares. Long story short - Longman Eagle is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I can't always abide a 3 hr wait so Hot Chocolate is a not so distant second for dinner , dessert, cocktails and a super helpful and friendly wait staff.

I saw that the overall rating as 4 stars on yelp and got really excited. Since I came to Chicago on a business trip, with a limited food stipend, I decided to check out restaurant.com. AMAZINGLY, they have a $25 certificate on here. Everything went smoothly with this restaurant and the food was quite good. What we had: Starter: - Mac n Cheese - very average, not sure why it was in \"its own cater gory\" Meals (boyfriend and I split both entrees) - Steak - pretty good; recommended - Lamb and Krema Kasa - not at all what I expected, but it was awesome (but a little on the greasy side)! Dessert - One banana, two banana bread pudding - AMAZING - Affogato - a little to rich/sweet for me, but it was good - Chamomile tea - nice that they use actual chamomile flowers, and not just a tea bag Wine: - I had 2 glasses of Riesling with dinner; it was good enough :) PROS: - Made reservations on Monday for Thursday for 2 people at 8 pm and it was no issue at all (unlike some other restaurants I had called)- Got a restaurant.com coupon - YAY! - Changed my reservation at around 7 pm to 8:30 pm with no hesitation - Walked in at 8:45 and was immediately seated - Presented the restaurant.com certificate at the beginning and didn't get the look from my server that you sometimes get (bc they think you are not going to order a lot or they think you are cheap) - Since we were seated close to the pay station/where the servers enter their orders, we had a lot of opportunities to ask our server about recommendations and just casually chat. She made a comment about us devouring the Bread Pudding, and I was like yeah it was great, but I didn't understand all the rave on the mac n' cheese. Unexpectedly, a few mins later when she brought our bill, I saw that she took the mac n cheese off the total. I totally did not expect this at all - super nice. And of course I tipped on the original total and then some - Price (esp with the $25 off certificate) was VERY reasonable.

We got free stuff and an apologu for the wait.When we sat down, we had complimentary appetizers brought out (YUM YUM YUM pretzels!!) which was another very nice gesture. Mindy came back out and asked how everything was... and the only complaint i had was that it took 40+ minutes to get our bottle of wine that we ordered. One of us had gotten our mixed drink before the wine showed up, and we got our appetizers of scallops and cheese before the wine. Other than that - AMAZING appetizers, yummy wine. For entrees, the majority of the table got the lamb sandwich on sourdough bread.... it was SO delicious, the lamb was so juicy and tender and it came with this super yummy hummus tasting side (dipping sauce) that i am not quite sure what it was, but it was great!!To further apologize for the wine taking a long time, Mindy brought us out a dessert platter on the house of warm donuts and carmel corn.... another unexpected awesome touch!! too bad we had ordered 3 desserts becasue we were too stuffed to barely touch them!

Now lets fast forward one year later to tonight. I don't know why, but for some reason Hot Chocolate has decided to start pumping loud house music into the place. The loud music causes the people to have to speak at a much higher level and sometimes yell at each other to hear. The volume of the place simply overpowered everything and killed the mood. I could not hear a word that anyone at my table said and we kept getting distracted by people at other tables yelling back and forth. I felt like I was eating at a dance club. A year ago the place was nice and quiet and warm, and now for some reason they seem to be trying to create some sort of a scene. However, the food was still great tonight but I just got more and more pissed off at how incredibly loud the place was. Our service was good up until the point at which we asked for our check. The waiter said, \"sure I'll bring the check, be right back\". Well, 15 minutes later there was no sign of him anywhere and no check had been delivered to our table. I looked around the room for him and discovered that he was sitting down at a table right next to us playing around with some I-phone that someone was showing him and discussing how neat the new I-phone is. I stared at him and he looked back and saw me looking at him several times but he continued gawking at the I-phone and all of it's great features. After waiting for about 20 minutes for him to bring us our check, I finally just went up to the manager and asked him if he could get our check for us, which he did. Unbelievable.

We try to go every week and suffer withdrawal when it's been too long past that. The menu is kind of diner-ish - that is there is a wide range of sandwiches and entrees all prepared under the umbrella of American food. But each and every recipe is treated with the thoughtfulness of a tasting restaurant like Tru or Trotters. The ingredients are sourced from many of the farms at the Green City Market (the best farmer's market in the area). In some cases the quality of the ingredients are all it takes to lift a simple dish to the next level (try the Mac and Cheese). But when they choose to twist a classic the results are surprising and delicious but appropriate (try the \"fish and chips\"). The pureed soups are subtle and silky. Mindy Segal, the owner, is a world class pastry chef and her menued desserts can be breathtaking, but ordering them is best done with a leap of faith. They are named for the central ingredient (banana, rhubarb, etc.) but after that they change frequently. The bartenders are extremely competent making one of the finest Manhattans in town and the wine list is thoughtful. The crowd can be very beautiful but the place is also kid and grandparent friendly early on. The service is really casual (as is the room) but attentive. The host desk is nice to us now that we are regulars, but can be a little standoffish to unknown customers. I think this may be the genesis of some of the less than glowing reviews received. The caveats are as follows. 1) Portions are not huge leaving room for an appetizer and a dessert (or skip the appetizer and order a side of the mac and cheese to share). 2) It's not cheap. With wine or cocktails, our tab for two is generally about 100 bucks. But based on the quality and delicious-ness it always seems like a value to me. Oh yeah, the hot chocolate is good too.

I made the reservation over a month in advance, and we were to be seated at the \"chef's table.\" It was a reasonably cool set up, away from the rest of the tables, with a view of the kitchen, partially behind a curtain. We were seated right on time, but it went downhill from there. Once our server had our food orders, we were pretty much on our own. With our view of the kitchen, we could see our appetizers just sitting there for several minutes, getting cold. I had an empty beer and an empty water glass for 10-15 minutes before I finally was able to flag down our server to ask for another drink. \u00a0After that we just gave up on him and started flagging down another server because ours was nowhere to be found. He seemed visibly agitated that he was having to serve our table (understandable, since we weren't his table), so we quit bothering him too.The food was actually pretty solid for the most part, and my medium rare burger would have been perfect had it not been cold by the time a server (not our server, who was still m.i.a.) brought it over. One of our party was pregnant, and therefore had to order her burger cooked at least medium. Another person is just a poor, misguided soul with no good excuse and she ordered her burger cooked medium well. The 4th burger our group ordered was also supposed to be cooked medium. What we got was 4 medium rare burgers. We flagged down someone else's waiter (our missing waiter was the theme of the night) and sent two of the burgers back. My pregnant friend's burger came back exactly as it had been before, still medium rare (I thought it looked delicious, but I'm a dude and fortunately not pregnant) and even colder than it was the first time we got it. The other burger came back, also still medium rare, but without the fried egg that used to be on it, and with an extra slice or two of soggy, apparently microwaved bacon.The one positive side effect of the burger drama was that someone actually got our server's attention and he paid our table a rare visit! He must have felt somewhat bad at that point (or maybe he could tell we were not happy), and for the last hour and a half of the three hours we sat there we at least had beverages in front of us rather than sad, empty glasses. All of the other entrees (halibut, steak, a salad) were fine. \u00a0We ordered a round of desserts, but I did not try any of them so I don't know how they were. The waiter did bring us some sort of free doughnut holes and caramel corn to make up for what he referred to as \"the kitchen's issues.\" The caramel corn was not great, and we barely touched it. There were 11 of us, and he brought us 8 complementary doughnut holes (nice math, guy!), so those of us that got one enjoyed them. They also discounted our bill $50, which was fair and more than the price of the 2 orders that were messed up and sat there mostly untouched. I was very tempted to stiff the waiter and not leave a tip, but I caved since we'd been there for 3 hours and he at least made an effort to take care of us for the last part of the night, anyway.All in all, I would go back here with a group of 2-4 and make sure we had a different server. I have a feeling the food would be much better if it was not cold, and when I can enjoy it with a beer instead of an empty glass.
