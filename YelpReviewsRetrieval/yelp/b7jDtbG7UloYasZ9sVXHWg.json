Food a while ago, without really paying much attention. So when I went to Vegas last month with a couple of friends and we passed by the restaurant one morning, intrigue got the better of me and I suggested we should all go in.Surprisingly, for a Thursday morning, it wasn't that busy, so we were straight in and taken immediately to a table.One word of warning - when you hear and read about the portion sizes at this place, take it seriously!! There's not many restaurants you go to where the server tells you in advance that the portions might just be too big for you. That goes for the menu as well!! There's an amazing amount of choice and it took all 3 of us a while to narrow it down to just 1 option.I ended up ordering the chicken and waffles dish, just because a customer at the next table had it and it looked extraordinary. I've never had so much food on a plate before and knew pretty much straight away that I wouldn't finish it all.I gave it a pretty good shot though, probably because the food (particularly the chicken) was cooked and seasoned beautifully. Suffice to say, there wasn't a lot of conversation around the table as the 3 of us attempted valiantly to finish the gargantuan portions.I do have to say that it was all a little more expensive, but you honestly can't really see this as a downside - considering the amount of food that's put in front of you, and the quality of it too.Also, don't go there unless you're really hungry.I'd wholeheartedly recommend Hash House A Go-Go and we would definitely return there if we're lucky enough to get back to Vegas in the future.", "Date": "2014-07-24", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Joaquin A.", "ReviewID": "gJKlPaO60eXtVdjzWwWgdQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Chicken was bomb.The serving was a lot, so come prepared to eat.

That's a good sign right? One time we waited a good 45 minutes but it was Mother's Day after all. Was the wait worth it...yes. I'm pretty much a traditional boring person when it comes to food. I like the simpler flavor versus the crazy unique flavors. Whenever I am here I order the corned beef hash which is definitely one if my favorites. Tender corned beef with skillet potatoes and Swiss cheese on top. I'm a cheesy girl and that cheese as weird as it may sound actually pairs well with it. I actually have ordered something off the special menu as well. \u00a0The crab cake Benedict on Mother's Day was pretty dang tasty. There was real crab and the crab vs. batter/filling ratio was about 2:1. It came with spinach and a spicy sauce (spicy to me) which was delicious. I've ordered drinks from HHAGG before and although good it's just too much. Their famous hot chocolate is huge! It's awesome but when I eat salty foods I like to drink the plain old H20. Overall I do like this place for brunch/breakfast but service can be a bit on the slow side when they have a full house.", "Date": "2014-07-18", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Ana C.", "ReviewID": "Kk69mCngWJNQIrOG2HTn_w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's kinda pricey but the food are huge.

I'll have to ask for that if there's a next time.

She started \"digging for gold\"=bacon when I stopped her. Hahaha! \u00a0H had the kid's Griddled Meatloaf served with mashed potatoes. The meatloaf obviously was precooked and just fried up on the grill to get it warm on the inside and crisp on the outside. It was very dense and average tasting, she claims my meatloaf tastes better. \u00a0The mashed potatoes were seasoned well and had good flavor. Not just a starchy scoop of potatoes.

As it was just barely noon, I was expecting to go for a burger or something, but I was swayed by the lure of some legitimate corned beef hash. \u00a0The \"Hash\" options seem to be one of their signature items, as per their name. I went with the Corned Beef which had, obviously, some deliciously prepared corned beef (like, not chopped up pre-packaged frozen stuff - it was as if it had been slow-prepared that day), swiss cheese, red onions (but not too much). The kicker is that it was served over a large amount of delicious oven-fried potato chunks rather than standard hash browns, all in a large square skillet (see picture). \u00a0Oh, and it also came with 2 eggs any style, a buttermilk biscuit, and a couple fruit garnishes. \u00a0That all was around $13 I think, which might seem like a lot but as I said, it was outrageously proportioned.

That being said, I'm addicted to Yelp and try places against those ideals when I feel it's worth it. Visiting here wasn't my pick. But it wasn't nearly as bad as reviews here led me to expect.20 minute wait for lunch on a Saturday around 11AM, pretty standard.We were seated at a cocktail table in the bar area and I really liked our server- Kelli?, lady with spiky hair and friendly, casual demeanor like a female Guy Fieri.BF ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, and highly suggested that I order the Kokomo meatloaf sandwich- so I did, with the house salad for the side instead of fries. \u00a0Portions for both are enormous and we could have easily shared just one dish, but wanted to try more than one dish. And now my guy has dinner to take with him to work tonight, so it all works out. $30 and change before tip.Fried chicken and waffles- chicken is actually pretty moist and flavorful, waffles weren't bad but also weren't my thing. Accents of fried leeks and some roasted peppers made this better than I expected. Didn't go overboard with the maple syrup.Meatloaf sandwich is hefty- ate about a third of it and had my fill of the flavors. Liked the tomato sauce, felt the mozzarella taste was masked by stronger flavors but the texture broke up the meat and bread a bit. Heavy and rich, even if you're hungry, split it.Ultimately, my careful picking at each dish and my hungry guy eating what he wanted (damn his metabolism!) only made half of each meal disappear. While many reviews here indicate that the kitchen is more focused on quantity than quality, the flavors weren't bad but given the gigantic portions, easily get redundant.

We were seated and the waiter came about 5 minutes after which was also fine. It gave us time to look over the menu which I wasn't impressed with. The menu was large, didn't offer anything to me that appealed to me. I ordered a vegetarian option since everything had with meat included pork which I do not eat. I must say, it would be nice to have turkey sausage or turkey bacon on the menu for those of us who doesn't eat pork. However, having a vegetarian breakfast wasn't a problem. I order an egg scrambled with veggies and cheese added. It came with fresh fruit, potatoes and a humongous biscuit. This biscuit was bigger than my palm! Sadly, that was the highlight of the meal. The potatoes had no flavor and were kinda cold. You can tell that they were cooked in large quantity earlier in the day and served out of pot. The fruit was sweet so I didn't have any issue. My eggs and veggies again lacked flavor. I had to add a nice amount of salt and pepper to give it some kinda \"umph\". The food was just OK.

I've been about 7 times or so now, to both this location, as well as the one at the Plaza. Pros:- You will never leave hungry. The portions are gargantuan. My father is very much the target demographic, a big, burly former farmer who likes his steak and potatoes measured in pounds, please. He's the only person I've ever seen casually finish a meal at HH. Just back from a early morning hike at Red Rocks and ready to eat a bear? Eat here.- The food's delicious. I've had the Chicken and Waffles a few times, the Chicken Pot Pie, some pancakes, and a few of the skillets, and have had nothing to complain about on any of them. The Chicken and Waffles are my favorite, because ooooohhh the skin on that chicken. Yum.- Mellow atmosphere, warm, friendly staff, and even when the place is super busy you never feel prodded or hurried to clear a table for the next person. You feel welcomed. I reaaaallly like that in a place like this, where you might be eating brunch for an hour. - Great hours for a family that insists on getting up at the crack of freakin' dawn, and even when they are busy, they have a dedicated place for you to wait, not just a curb or a crowded entryway. - Price is darn good for the food quality and quantity. A bottomless cup of coffee is about the same price here and at Egg Works; which means I'm not getting a fun surprise on my bill. That Chicken and Waffles is usually Lunch, Dinner, and lunch the next day for me. As long as you have a fridge at hand for your leftovers, Hash House is a great deal. Cons:- You will never leave hungry. Holy balls there's a lot of food. If your mom raised you to clean your plate, or you are from Europe and have never heard of the Doggy Bag this place will give you pangs. - You can definitely eat yourself sick. Be aware of your tummyfeelings.- Both locations are Popular, and they can get busy. And I mean really busy. Saturday morning around brunch time? Call ahead for wait times, and be ready for a wait around an hour if you get unlucky. This is not the place to come for fast food, or a quick nip in and out. Settle in, bring a newspaper for the wait, and enjoy that bottomless cup of coffee. If you come here with expectations for other than a leisurely meal, you made a mistake.- I can't imagine this place would be good for very large groups.

If I had known it was fruit and not berries, I probably wouldn't have ordered since I know my kids don't like cantaloupe. Also, I saw a bunch of fun looking drinks getting served to all of the tables around us. No one ever offered us a drink menu and I had no idea that they had so many fun drink options.

Everyone else at my table disagreed and said it was really good!- Mushroom & Swiss BurgerMy friend who got this was a little disappointed that it wasn't a 1 lb patty, but instead divided into 2 patties. He said it was good/okay, and I tried the fries which were seasoned well and tasty. He wishes he had gotten something that Hash House is more known for (like the two dishes above).- Watermelon kiwi lemonadeWow this drink was BOMB! Apparently, our server told us that it was voted \"best drink in Vegas,\" at which point, my friends and I all turned to each other and were like, isn't that the Fat Tuesday??? Anyways, he totally sold us on the drink and we got three of them. Wow, he was not kidding, it was soooo good. The drink comes in a glass which has the flavors layered, with the red watermelon on the top, yellow lemonade in the middle, and green kiwi on the bottom. It's also garnished with a slice of watermelon on the rim of the glass. Definitely looked really pretty and Instagram-worthy, if you want to take pictures. ;) When you're ready to drink, make sure to mix it up first. It tasted really refreshing and everyone in my group really liked it!This place is not the best for large groups. We had a group of 19 and they said their largest table held 15. We agreed to be split up into different tables then, but somehow, they still saw it as being fit to charge us gratuity??? I was at a table of 5, seated so far away from the rest of my group that there were several tables in between us and I could barely see them. Not sure where they got off justifying that but whatever. That's the only reason I'm docking a star, but everything else was great.TL; DR:- Portion sizes are huge, split with a friend. Trust me, you'll still be stuffed.- Try what Hash House is known for: fried chicken benedict, chicken & waffles, & the watermelon kiwi lemonade.- Not good for large groups (15+) and even if you split into different tables, they'll still tack on gratuity. - DELICIOUS food, and if you've never been here before, you must try it!", "Date": "2014-01-14", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Nieves D.", "ReviewID": "PodXNu3JS5KVaY27pcTEvQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "At first I thought I would be impressed by this place because everything smelled delicious and portions going around were enormous!First bite wasn't what I expected...There was nothing special about their food ..

My friends and I drove over to this joint on a recent trip, excited about the prospect of a delicious breakfast.

They stack all of the food really high here, with a big sprig of rosemary inexplicably stuck in the top of everything. It's so impressive that my friend asked a neighboring table if she could photograph their burger. Anyway, we didn't order lunch, but maybe we should have. Maybe that's their specialty. Because it sure ain't breakfast!My friend and I each got a different kind of Eggs Benedict. Hers came doused in marinara sauce for some reason. Wtf? I ordered the smoked salmon florentine and they chose to smother this one in something that looked and tasted like Thousand Island dressing. The salmon was not like any kind of \"smoked salmon\" you are imagining. It was dry and clumpy, with a texture like it had been served three days prior as an entree and then nuked and reconstituted for this dish. There were also long twigs in the potatoes - what? I am not making this up. Look at some of the photos on this page! They put twigs in it on purpose! And the whole thing was topped off with that giant rosemary sprig, sticking out of the top like a g*d*amn Christmas tree.I love breakfast. Fancy breakfasts, greasy diner breakfasts, you name it. But this...this was disgusting. It is rare that I can't find something on my plate to eat, but this was simply inedible garbage food.

Heck, I'd pay the same price for half the food if it were really tasty!We went on a Saturday morning and early enough to beat the huge rush (we got there about 9:30 or 10am). Our wait was about 20 minutes, while the wait was an hr. plus when we left. We sat inside and while we waited we watched huge platters of food being brought out of the kitchen and instantly determined we'd be sharing a meal.We ordered the Tractor Driver Combo: 2 eggs over medium, bacon and a blueberry pecan pancake ($13.95). We added a side of Biscuits and Gravy. The meal came out and they'd given us potatoes instead of bacon, but brought us bacon when we complained - so hey free potatoes (although I didn't care for the rosemary seasoning, I didn't think it went with the sweetness of the pancake). Also as we cut into our eggs it was obvious that they were not cooked to medium, even the egg whites were runny.. the eggs ran into the pancake which is a big pet peeve of mine. The pancake was HUGE! Together we didn't even eat 1/3 of it! It was good but came with a very small side of syrup, I imagine people are constantly asking for more syrup. I would have if I'd eaten more of my gigantic pancake.The food didn't wow us. I didn't try the biscuits and gravy, but the bf didn't finish them so that says a lot, generally he would. Our conversation the entire meal was about how unhealthy the portion sizes were, how it was almost to the point of making us lose our appetites, and how we watched person after person send away their plates with tons of food still on them *thankfully*. It's unfortunate that other countries are starving and we rave about places with portion sizes that should feed multiple people.

Environment: This place attempts to create an oxymoron by juxtaposing two seemingly unrelated things: farm food and cool,young,progressive/hipsters. This kinda seems like they are making a stab at country food and county people by making it into a novelty. Service: The service (after 3 visits) is hit-or-miss. The environment is that of a hipster, \"cool person\" hang out. A lot of the servers have an alternative look with tattoos and piercings and less than everyday hairdos. So, sometimes the servers act cool and laid-back. This leads to them being slow and unattentive at times because they are too busy being laid back and cool. We ordered coffee three times. Refills were slow every time. If you're a morning coffee person and you're paying $2.25+ for coffee, you expect refills. Although I will say, the coffee here is excellent.Food: Food is pretty good. Good presentation. Large Portions. Cooked well. Like I said, it seems like they are attempting to create a menu of \u00a0totally exaggerated, larger than life dishes. Fattening, full of butter, oil, and starchy carbohydrates, just like you would eat on a farm (so they think.) However, true country people that grew up on a farm needed all the extra calories because they were working their butts off all day outside. This restaurant plays on the idea of being a country, farmer \"hick\" by hyperbolizing and exaggerating the consumption of high fat, high sugar, \"corn fed\" food.

I know I'm an overly sensitive person, but I feel I can typically get a pretty good read on people and she just had this whole \"I'm above all this\" aura (For a second, I thought I was back in undergrad with all the high maintenence NYC and Long Island JAPs), which was a bit off putting. I just hate poor service having worked in the industry. How do you hire people for FOH that are like this. Will give her the benefit of the doubt though, as you never know what people are going through at a particular time.As for the food. Solid, hearty good food. The portions were indeed gigantic. I had to follow the masses and get the Sage Fried Chicken benedict and it was good, but not as great as I had hoped for. The chicken was a bit under seasoned when eating it without the massive glop of sauce on the plate. Didn't understand the need for the fried pasta in every plate. Also had some of the HH Original benedict. It was covered in a red pepper type sauce that looked like marinara. Very average tasting plate IMO. Wanted to try the griddled French Toast and would go back to try that, since it looks absolutely delicious.We also got tangerine house mimosas at $7.99 a piece. Pretty good, wish they had a bottomless option for people who are constantly thirsting for alcohol like me, but so it goes. \u00a0Satisfying meal; reasonable costs considering the portions, but prefer places that don't need to have massive portions and rely on flavors more.

For Hash House A Go Go \"big portions\" is a complete and total understatement. WARNING this place has monster size plates of food leaving the kitchen! This is not the restaurant to be eating with your eyes. Now, let's move onto the food quality. We had a total of four dishes the first \u00a0is the Hash House Meat Loaf Pasta. It had charred tomato, basil pesto and crispy parmesan cheese. This pasta was an a decent dish but my taste for pasta has changed since I went to Italy. Pasta in the United States is unable to compete with it. The Slow Grilled BBQ Pork Ribs was amazing. I highly recommend this dish. The ribs are braised with a house soy BBQ sauce and served with mashed potatoes. The ribs was tender and the meat just fell off the bone.The potatoes was the only disappoint on this dish since is was dry. The Kokokmo, is meatloaf with tomato and griddled smooth mozzarella cheese on milk bread. Reminded me a lot of a mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich with meatloft. It took an extra couple of minutes for the last dish to arrival comared to the other dishes for some reason. The last dish was the Famous One Pound Stuffed Burger. We had the hardwood smoked bacon, avocado & cheddar it comes with two patties with lettuce tomato and red onion. The prices were a little higher than I usually like to pay, but once we saw the plates of food coming out it didn't matter anymore.

They're located about 5 miles west of the strip on Sahara Ave. Although the place was fairly busy for a Monday morning, we only waited about 10 minutes for our seat. There rustic and casual take on traditional breakfast and comfort food is insanely good. We ordered the sage fried chicken and waffles, smoked salmon scramble and blueberry pecan flapjacks. We were visually wowed when our food arrived.The sage fried chicken and waffles was massively huge, piled high and beautifully presented. It must have been stacked 8-10 inches high and artistically decorated with huge sprigs of rosemary and sage leaves. I didn't know whether to eat it or pray to the food gods. It was truly amazing and the quality was downright excellent and delicious.The chicken was well seasoned, tender, light crisp on the outside and scrumptious. Inside the waffles were infused with bits and pieces of bacon which caught me off guard and happily surprised. Gratifyingly savory while still sweet, they're definitely better than any chicken and waffles I've tasted before. It makes Rosco's chicken and waffles in LA more like a kid's meal. For you pancake lovers, their flapjacks are incredibly huge and almost the size of a pizza. Most importantly, it was delicious. They don't skimp on toppings either. Each flapjack was packed and full of blueberries and pecans. Every bite had something in it. On a more civilized level, the smoked salmon scramble portions were smaller and regular size compared to the other dishes. Both the brie and pesto provided scrumptious fusion of flavor and texture. Accompanied with potato hash and toast, it was tasty and hearty breakfast.The food here is crazy good and prices are very reasonable (entree $10-$15). Our server was friendly, attentive and refilled our coffee and water promptly.

I mean the food doesn't really taste that good. So why do I keep coming back \u00a0if I don't like the place? Easy, out of town visitors. They've all heard about the place with food bigger than you're head. I can't say I don't warn them that it's not very good but hey, what do I know? What annoys me most about HH, the fried spaghetti and rosemary they stab and litter every plate with. I know its their signature but having to remove all the inedible bits from my plate is pretty lame. If it's not edible don't put it on the plate. A few highlights from our last visit.Traditional Buttermilk Flapjack - bigger than your head, thick, fluffy pancake. Nothing particularly special aside from the sheer size. We had this as a brunch appetizer and had a hard time finishing it. The Kokomo - huge meatloaf sandwich that was on the dry side. To be fair I grew up on moms meatloaf and trust me seldom any live up to her sweet juicy meat slab. I think the chief problem with the Kokomo is that the bread to meat ratio is way off. To much bread. Andy's sage fried chicken - very disappointing. The chicken while under seasoned was covered in a thick glaze of maple syrup reduction which just tasted weird to us. Unfortunately the reduction was also on the eggs and the bacon. I think if I were to order this again it would be with plain maple syrup on the side. That way I can control the sweet to savory ratio.With all of that said of course Ill be coming back with out-of-towners.

Portions are so huge, it's ridiculous. There's no way you'll be able to finish everything on your plate, unless you stick with a side of toast. Even then, you'll probably end up with an entire loaf. I was drawn here because of Man V. Food, and ended up ordering the dish that Adam made famous: it's advertised as a \"farm benedict,\" but what benedict have you ever seen that included a mound of mashed potatoes? In addition to sage fried chicken, fresh spinach, smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs? This thing isn't a benedict, it's a HOUSE! A very tasty house, as it turns out, but still. I have a pretty good appetite, but was finished only halfway through. My wife ordered the riddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup, and lest you think her portion was any smaller, you'd be wrong. Like I said, this place thrives on excess! The french toast was chewy and delicious, with a hint of vanilla, and the warm bananas were a divine accompaniment. It all paired perfectly well with smoky bacon. Again though, it was impossible to finish more than half. Because we were on the road, this sadly meant wasting some of that delicious food, as there wasn't really an opportunity to eat the leftovers later.

My boyfriend got the french toast.His french toast sounded soo good on the menu description, and when it was served, it looked fantastic, except for the griddled bananas (served in the peel, which was black and mushy, tasted good but very unappealing looking) his french toast tasted like nothing, and was mushy and in general, just kind of blah.My pancake was HUGE, and yummy, but my over medium eggs were basically raw, I mean the yolks were super runny (which is fine, I never, ever send food back) I was going to eat them until I noticed that the whites werent even cooked, I mean, runny whites on an over medium egg? Yuck! I asked the waitress for new ones and she obliged saying, \"oh sure, you might want more of an over medium.\" Um, yeah cause that's what I ordered. She brings the eggs back out and clearly the cook was annoyed that they got sent back, because he cooked the crap out of these eggs, I mean, they were beyond well done. Whatever, I mean the pancake was so huge I didn't even need the eggs at that point.Fast forward to them picking up the bill, I was paying by credit, they took the card, and then a different person came back and asked for Id, which I accidentally left at home. (If its your policy to get Id for credit cards, that's fine, but maybe ask for the identification before you run the card?) I explained I didn't have it and instead of offering another option he glared at me and asked if it was really my card. I mean, come on. I said that yes it is my card and he just mumbled something under his breath and walked off! We had cash, and would have paid in cash! To top it off we had to wait another few minutes for them to bring me a pen so I could sign the receipt. \u00a0Really? I wanted to love this place, again the menu for breakfast is really enticing.

We wanted to experience it just for the novelty. \u00a0Amongst the three of us we had the pancakes with hash browns, eggs over easy and chicken sausage; the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger with fries and watermelon lemonade, and the Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger with the same fries. We also tried the barbecued ribs appetizer.First, the lemonade, which was tasty, was $5.00, no refills. That's way overpriced for lemonade that isn't spectacular, but it was attractive looking. Next, we specifically asked for the appetizer to be brought out before the meal (sort of the definition of the term \"appetizer,\" right? We shouldn't have had to say anything) but it came AFTER the meal was brought out. How ridiculous is that? So two disappointments.When the pancake came out it was large, but it was underwhelming compared to the hype it got on TV. \u00a0Yes it was really big- bigger than one outstretched medium sized female hand. It filled up maybe 2/3 of the oval plate it was served on, leaving room for maybe one cup of cubed potatoes (hashbrowns) and 2 eggs over easy. But check out this photo from Man vs. Food: yhoo.it/18O6aVt - this was CLEARLY nothing close to what we got, hence the disappointment. \u00a0 The seasoned potatoes had no flavor, and the pancake tasted like flour. \u00a0No flavor at all. \u00a0We asked for chicken sausage and one link arrived, splayed open on a small dish. It was basically a hot dog, not sausage.On to the Apple Smoked Bacon & Mashed Potato Burger. The teenager enjoyed it greatly, however, the teenager likes just about anything. The burger has one pound of meat divided into two pre-made, pre-seasoned patties that are cooked in a press of some kind so that both sides are cooked simultaneously. This means no way to request medium rare. \u00a0Sigh...The Hardwood Smoked Bacon, Avocado & Cheddar Burger was tasty, although the meat flavor seemed to come from the grill without additional seasoning. Well, let's just say the seasoning was mild. I won't complain too much about the burger- it was satisfying. \u00a0The fries serving size was average. I think they were seasoned, and had a nice crunch. The ribs came in what appeared to be an Asian-inspired sauce, which I liked. One of the \u00a0four ribs was perfect, with tender meat falling off the bone. The others were chewy and tough. Hate to speculate on the disparity- I'll leave that to you. They were artfully leaned against a pile of cold, nasty-tasting potatoes. \u00a0What a waste of potato. We got the impression that much of the food is pre-packaged, pre-seasoned, so not much creativity happens in the preparation.The atmosphere was different from what I expected- the dark lighting made a nice ambience even though the food is Denny's quality. \u00a0I liked the distressed wood everywhere and the (very) heavy metal chairs.So, we will chalk this up to experience and probably not come back as a family, although I'd bring the teen here if he wanted the burger again. for $13 it wasn't so awful in my opinion. Oh- the waitress was EXCELLENT- she got a full 20% tip.", "Date": "2013-05-06", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Jade L.", "ReviewID": "L8jFZb4MwzNy-2xN49bdTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE LOVE!

Visited this place with a friend after we've been curious of it after a long time. Disappointed, big time. Food was decent, service was decent, place the decent, atmosphere was loud. I ordered some chorizo hash, and my friend had french toast. The hash had deep-friend potatoes (probably from frozen), with some sauce and cheese on top. The chorizo was the soft type that just turned into liquid after it was cooked so there was only a few chunks left. It was alright, not mind blowing.My friend's french toast was worse. It was made of thick slabs of bread (good, right?) that had barely touched egg before they were fried--it was pretty much bread with a egg coating on the outside. If you didn't know: French toast is bread SOAKED in egg, and fried. But this was barely touched, so it was like eating hot bread rather than eggy goodness. The toppings were a bit bland as well.Bottom line: If you want to go to a place that puts more priority on decorating, than actually making your food taste good, go here. Big proportions that don't need to be that big, dressed up for no reason, decent food.Next time, we're probably going to head to Ihop or Denny's.

Apparently, I've been searching for love in all the wrong places and it was hiding all along on Sahara Ave in Sin City. The first thing you notice about hash house are the gigantic portions. Often associated with vegas, big food is kind of a staple in the city but it is not always of the highest quality. I think I ate a hot dog for a buck that is still wreaking havoc in me. However, hash house offers dishes with flavor even bigger than the portions. Their waffles are a God send as they are light and fluffy and stuffed with bacon. The fried chicken is moist and succulent on the inside and popping with crunch and flavor on the outside. Their meat loaf is better than any granny will make (just don't tell them that). And their pancakes can be mistaken for blankets they're so big! Now with all that said, you'd think you would have to drop some serious coin on a breakfast or lunch this epic. That's where you're wrong! The food is so reasonably priced you almost feel guilty! Almost! For a massive meal that will keep you warm for days, you're probably looking at around 12-15 bucks.

I did not indulge, but my buddies did. Let me tell you, this thing was impressive. It's a sky high platter filled with mashed potatoes, homemade biscuits, fired chicken, eggs, and chipotle cream sauce. They bury a knife in it for scale.I opted for the mushroom, artichoke heart, sundried tomato hash for a healthier option and it was really well done. Flavorful and served with perfectly crispy potatoes and one of their flaky homemade biscuits. If you're into bloody mary's, they make a really great one. Spicy and tangy, exactly how it should be.

After a short wait of approximately 25 minutes, my wife and I were seated in the bar area. This location is HUGE with lots of space, and every inch is needed since it gets really busy. The bar area was fine for dining, but the music was a bit too loud for a Saturday morning; I'm usually not one to complain about loud music, but I honestly couldn't hear my wife who was sitting two feet away from me over the blaring music. The service was pretty decent and our waitress was prompt and attentive considering how busy she was. The folks at Hash House A Go Go definitely have character (and dress up as various characters like Wonder Woman and Superman), but also do their jobs well. The service gets 4 stars, but I cannot justify giving this place a thumbs up because their food is underwhelming. The food runner needed both arms and a lot of strength to deliver our meatloaf hash. The meatloaf hash along with the chicken and waffles were enough to feed to a family of four...but we both gave it the old college try and dug right in. The chicken and waffles were big, but only in quantity; they certainly were not big in either flavor or taste. Putting two whole chicken breasts and mixing bacon into the waffles sounds nice in theory, but the execution here is poor.

I'm pretty sure this place gets a lot more attention and fame since Man Vs. Food came here.I ordered the \"Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit\" and the \"Kiwi Watermelon drink.\" The presentation was amazing and I would recommend getting it especially if you're into Chicken & Waffles. Personally, I am not into that combination but I wanted to try it anyway because of all the recommendations. I don't think anyone puts bacon in the waffle--interesting. I sort of wish I got something else after seeing other peoples' dishes but I still enjoyed what I got.The service was amazing and the atmosphere was lively.

Plus, we had a $50 gift cert from Restaurant.com that's only good for dinner, so that helped influence things. At first glance, the menu is mightily expansive. Everyone ordered all types of food, including chicken pot pie, salads, crab cakes and swordfish. The pot pie was especially a sight to behold. The crust resembled a UFO that had just crash landed on a planet full of chopped-up chicken and veggies. I settled on the sage fried chicken, which was accompanied with a waffle tower that has smoked bacon incorporated inside, drizzled with hot maple caramel syrup. There's something about eating a dish with a huge knife smack dab in the middle, standing upright, holding all of the bits and pieces of your food together. The dish was flanked by two huge fried chicken breasts, and when I took my first bite, it was nothing I had ever tasted before. Immediately, I tasted the hint of the sage herb throughout the meat, then the sweetness of the maple syrup on the fried outer crust from the skin. I must admit, although the white meat was juicy and tender, I wished I had a dark meat thigh or leg to gnaw on too.The bacon-infused waffle was delicious, crispy on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside. After eating two chicken breasts, I could only finish off a couple pieces of the waffle. I was more than stuffed. Plus, my taste buds were getting numb from the sweetness of the dish. It's a good thing I'm in Vegas, there was plenty of night left to burn it off. And if this were a Man vs. Food challenge, I would obviously sigh and agonize in defeat.But no matter, I know for a fact that I would want a rematch in the near future.

My culinary experience has not encompassed many types and varieties of meat loaf, so for all I know this was a special gourmet meat loaf that I have not been properly schooled to appreciate. To me it was just peculiar. The waitress informed me that it's a combination of pork and beef. The meat seemed overly ripe. It was compressed like salami, not flaky like typical meatloaf. The hash had big hunks of salami-like meat loaf, home fries, spinach and peppers.The hash is served in a heavy cast iron skillet. The rock-hard biscuit had a sprig of Rosemary poking out of it like a Christmas tree. \u00a0There was also a dry Paul Bunyan-sized flapjack accompanied by tiny beaker of syrup not nearly enough to sweeten the flapjack.

I made sure I had enough protein, carbs, and starches in my system to keep me going for the long haul. Boy, did that plan come to fruition.My family and I showed up around 10am and were seated shortly. We ended up getting the Sage Fried Chicken on top of the Spinach Scramble which also had Biscuits and Gravy. Somewhere in there were slabs of bacon and a whole bunch of country potatoes. zOMG! I loved how, although the fried chicken was so large, it was juicy and tender and not at all dried out. The eggs were kind of overwhelming, but I love eggs. The biscuits were a little dense and dry, but the fatty and gluttonous gravy helped solve that issue. Every part of that platter was enjoyable. Three adults split that one entree and we barely cleaned it off.Service was somewhat slow, as our server was conveniently missing in action, while we saw all the other servers zipping by constantly. The line to get a table was pretty long by the time we left. One grip [hence the 4 stars and not 5], was the fact that there was a $2.50 splitting fee. In encouraging each person to perform their own personal episode of Man vs Food, they've enforced a fee on top of splitting the food.The one way you can waive that splitting fee is by ordering a side: a side of fruit, some bacon, biscuits, or even, yes you guessed it, a bowl of country gravy.

My husband was surfing all of the reviews on Yelp. He asked me two or three times if this is what I wanted because most of the reviews mention the huge portions and the \"Man Vs. Food\" show that this was on. By the way, the wait was not that long.Well, for those of you who are not acquainted with the show, it is a scourge on America, IMHO. The idea it seems, and I have watched it more than once, is for the host of the show to eat enormous portions of challenging food. I wonder why his liver has not enlarged the way Morgan Spurlock's (of the movie \"SuperSize Me\") did. Probably because he must wait and detoxify between shows. I recommend watching it sometime, it is truly disgusting and an example of Gluttony in the worst way.Well, my husband kept giving me hints that the experience may not be what I wanted, since I am interested in quality not quantity, but I was hungover and needed to eat.We sat down at a table and noticed that almost every fourth person eating at the tables around us was HUGE.

The show that is suggesting that people should try and eat this HUGE portion of food, when really your stomach is only about the size of your fist.Well, onto the meal. First, I have to say the waitperson was very nice, and that is about all I liked about this place.The food came. We ordered the fried chicken breast benedict and a spinach salad. The spinach salad must have had a half a pound of well cooked, rather tasty bacon on it, but wow, toooo much bacon. And I LOVE bacon. I must say that the salad was tasty.The other order was also tasty, but it was ENORMOUS and a giant pile of sadness.Mashed Potatoes, with bacon on top, covered by three deep fried breaded chicken breasts with scrambled eggs and fried cheese on top covered in what must have been a pint of, once again, tasty sauce. Oh, and there were some biscuits strewn about the plate that were the size of two stacked hockey pucks. They were also good.But what they have done, is taken this to an extreme that is just awful. Tone it down a bit, smaller portions, like maybe 10-20% of the size would be fine.The experience was very disheartening, and pretty disgusting.

We went for my friend's birthday because he claims he's enjoyed this place before.First off, I can't understand how this place has high ratings at all. The food is shitty, and the service is horrendous. When we walked in, the first place we were seated was right near the entrance where people can walk past you on two sides. I politely told the hostess that the table was unacceptable, and that we wanted to sit in a booth. She tries moving us two tables over so that we're right next to the busing station, and all the servers would be walking past us and guests on their way to the toilet. Apparently \"please seat us in a booth, we don't want people walking behind us while we're eating\" is something that's not understandable. We had to then wait 10 minutes for them to clean an empty booth.We sat down and hadn't even had a chance to look at the menus, when our obnoxious waiter came up and asked if we were ready to order. We told him we'd like some time to look at the menu, and would let him know when we were ready. Less than two minutes passed, and he returned and asked again for our order. We had to repeat this three times.We were served cold biscuits with honey and butter. The biscuits were not light and fluffy, nor were they very tasty. We also had an ant in our bowl, which we found after we had been eating. When we told a passing server about it, she responded with \"Did you find it before or after you ate the biscuits?\" ... What? We found a LIVE INSECT IN OUR FOOD. What does it matter if it was \"before or after\"? Everyone's plates came on obnoxiously sized serving dishes. My husband and I had ordered a kokomo sandwich, which came on dry assed texas toast, despite being called \"milk bread\". There were no sauces or anything to add flavor to it. The meatloaf, while tasty, is nothing I couldn't make better at home, and the sandwich was definitely NOT worth $13. My mashed potatoes came with, what looked like a sheet of cheese colored plastic on top of them. I couldn't even puncture it with a fork... The bacon was kinda glued to the cheese as well. My sandwich also came with a steak knife jammed into the middle of it, and a tree of rosemary. Not good presentation at all.I ordered an arnold palmer to drink. I told a passing waitress (the ant woman) that it tasted off and was watered down. I honestly think the fresh brewed tea they had, was just a cup of water that had sat next to a teabag at some point. Very poor quality.Our original server had gone from being hovering to neglectful. We didn't see him until after it was time to drop the check.

French toast is okay but a little too sweet.Their chicken 'n waffles were not that good - the waffles were too saturated in syrup and were soggy.

Today, Hash House a Go Go is nothing more than a bad joke, where the punch line is actual line you have to stand to wait for a seat.The first and most glaring problem is the staff - both front of the house and back.The wait staff is clearly more interested in their tips than anything else. This happens quite a lot when a restaurant gets popular - it tends to draw the kind of servers who know that your crappy little tip will have no effect on their daily take, so they focus on turnover instead of quality. They don't care if you are unhappy with anything, just eat and get out so they can get someone else at your table. Management loves these kinds of servers, because they increase the bottom line. The kitchen staff is even worse. My HH Original Benedict was drowning in red pepper sauce - I mean DROWNING. Just touching it with a fork caused a tsunami that almost crashed over the edge of the plate. I liked the sauce, but it became the only thing you could taste. The biscuit was just terrible, it was so heavy it was indistinguishable from the potatoes it rested on and together they tasted like paste. Now if this is on purpose (some sort of take on their 'going to extremes' theme) then the chef who created this monstrosity is an idiot.

Because of that I've always tried to avoid eating there. I finally gave in the other day and stopped by for dinner, even though they're not know for their post-breakfast foods.We got there early and were seated right away, unfortunately at the crappiest table they had -- the table closest to the entrance and in a high-traffic area. We even asked the hostess if we could have a booth but she said she had to seat us at a table. Continuing with the bad service, our waiter decided not to show up at our table for a good ten minutes. Another fifteen minutes later we finally got some water, which prompted my wife to pull the hostess aside and politely ask her to move us or give us better service.After that, the service wasn't bad. Too bad we couldn't say the same about the food. Sure, the huge biscuits coated in honey were good, but the other two items we tried needed a lot of work. The crab cake chowder had a decent crab cake placed in the soup bowl -- not jumbo lump crab, just the shredded meat parts. The chowder was devoid of potatoes, had very little corn and was so thick that it was more pudding than soup.The roasted butternut squash with mushroom risotto was some of the most bland, unappealing risotto I've ever had and the flavor of the dish was completely over-powered by a heaping mound of sundried tomatoes. The lightly battered shrimp that was in the dish was decent and the asparagus may have been the best tasting thing on the plate.The presentation of the food is much more impressive than the taste.

So, we opted for the one about 6 miles off the strip. Don't let the drive to it scare ya, as it's lined with a lot of vacant businesses. You will reach the location as it's across a CarMax and it's next to some Vampire themed club (no, I'm not joking).We got here around 8:30am Saturday and the place was pretty vacant. We took the tip from others stating to get here before 10am. Loved the mellow ambiance of the place and the staff was super friendly and got seated with our menus asap. Their menu was no joke and goes way beyond the standard breakfast options.

The BBQ cream gave it a different flavor because I'm a hollandaise type of gal, but it worked for this dish! Seriously, 2 people could have split this entree, but I got through about 75% on my own (hey, needed the carbs for the hiking!). Definite try if you're an eggs benedict person like me. As for the Tractor Driver combo, it was a borderline pothole sized pancake with eggs and bacon. The hubby can eat pancakes, but even he only ate about 1/2 of the pancake in order to eat the eggs and bacon as well. Goodness!

It tasted gross, but oddly, I think it was supposed to taste that way...My most recent visit was for dinner. I had the sage chicken with the penne pasta. I did not like the pasta, but the chicken was pretty good. My boyfriend got the sage fried chicken and waffles. He thought it was amazing and so did I!

Hash House is five star all the way. The food, the ambiance, the servers, the drama! And you guys are reviewing it like it's just some other diner! It's been a few months since my visit, and I am really craving this place. This location is off the strip, and caters to the locals. I am sure they also see their share of tourists, that like us, rent cars. If you are vacationing without a car, I am sure there are more convienent locations. My advice if you are eating here? Come very hungry! Bringing a large group will also come in handy so you can try a bunch of stuff. We were a group of 6. This is the kind of place where you end up ordering more from seeing what's coming to other tables, than from the actual menu. First thing to catch my eye was a HUGE mug of hot chocolate! Gotta have it! But will it be good, or is it just razzle dazzle? It was amazing! Next I served myself from a couple of the skillets that arrived at the table. These are one of their specialties, and they were really good. We're talking potatoes, eggs, and then a bunch of different items you could choose to go in there. Honestly, I don't even remember what was in there, because the pancakes came! Once the pancakes came, everything else was history! These were not your ordinary pancakes. These were OMG, eyes rolling to the back of your head, I'll have what she's having, died and gone to heaven pancakes. Hands-down, the best pancakes anywhere, ever in my life. There were sliced bananas and brown sugar cooked into them. The brown sugar was melted and carmelized with the bananas, and it all came together in one ooey gooey heavenly dish. Now under the influence of these pancakes, I was unable to even try anything else on the table.

I don't really need to say much about that. Isn't everything better with bacon?? Just kidding...The other highlight was the Blueberry Pecan flapjacks. Nutty and fruity fluffy soft pancakes drizzled with warm maple syrup. Nom nom nom... My son even gobbled it up.Their service is great, the only thing that takes awhile is your food to arrive.

(I just learned from a friend that HHAGG is NOT a chain.)My friend and I planned to order 'The Original' Benedict, which features a biscuit, spinach, mashed potatoes, scrambled egg (which is the only kind of egg they offer for 'late' breakfast, which makes me wonder if the eggs are already pre-cooked), bacon, and a red pepper cream sauce. We asked for a simple substitution, and were met with a perplexed look on the face of our server \u00a0- we asked to have the bacon on the side (my friend cannot eat pork), and a substitution of the red pepper cream (I am allergic to red peppers) with the chile cream offered on another Benedict dish.The waitress stopped writing the order down at one point and said she didn't think the 'chef' would accommodate our request, because it was \"changing the integrity of the dish!\" \u00a0Ok, granted, every restaurant should have a signature dish, but for goodness' sake - the service staff is using verbiage like 'chef' and 'integrity of a dish' in a scrambled-egg only, dry biscuit, ridiculously-gargantuan portioned, \u00a0family joint? \u00a0I politely asked the server to go ask the chef what he recommended for two guests with our dietary restrictions.All said and done, they ended up 'allowing' our request of bacon on the side and a different sauce, only after we agreed to pay an additional fee for the substituted sauce. \u00a0Made me wonder if I would have ordered the dish which contained the sauce I had wanted, and substituted with the red pepper cream, would they have given me a discount?Our bill for 2 coffees, 1 Original Benedict, 'a side of chile cream sauce', and a side of smoked salmon was $29.00 - oh, I almost forgot the 'token rosemary spring' stuck smack-dab in the middle of the food (I have been pondering how a rosemary sprig helps the 'integrity' of the dish)! Considering I had to wash the dry, brittle biscuit down with two glasses of water, the scrambled eggs were cold and brown, and even the rosemary sprig was wilting (what is the purpose of an inedible garnish anyway - have you ever eaten the raw sprig of parsley or kale obtrusively arranged on the side of your plate?), I would have to say that value was non-existent in this restaurant.It has always been my belief that even the most rudimentary of restaurants understand that accommodating reasonable guest requests is a basic tenet of 'hospitality', especially in a troubled economic climate.", "Date": "2009-08-10", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Nouveau B.", "ReviewID": "V5gT_JbZEfAvoMWXJ8IPfA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Rancid potatoes, greasy eggs, surly service, uncooked dessert, bad, bad, bad.

Sorry to let you down there. So here it goes.1. Food - Love, love, love the menu! They have a great selection of \"twisted\" farm foods that will have your mouth watering. The presentation of the food, although sometimes a bit over the top, is crazy and interesting and has not heard anything short of \"Wow\" from the people I have gone with. I have tried a few different items from the menu, my favorite so far being the Hash House Meatlof with Pasta. On this most recent visit I had their version of Chicken Pot Pie and it was big on the WOW factor but a bit short on the flavor and taste. The first meal from here I can honestly say I was a bit disappointed in. The veggies needed some seasoning and the weird hat pie crust thing (don't know how else to describe it) was almost a bit stale and really difficult to eat.2. Service - have had no problems here. Nothing to rave about or complain about.3. Atmosphere - pretty relaxed and calm nothing too exciting. I did enjoy eating outside on the patio when the weather was nice.4. Drinks - had to use this just to mention how amazing the Strawberry Lemonade is. I haven't tried anything else because I can't stop drinking this stuff. MMMmmm... I might have to stop in and get a to-go cup now.To be quite honest, I'm not sure why I keep going back so much. There are places cheaper with just as good quality food.

I saw a biker kind of guy next to us eat 3/4 of it, which I though was super impressive. Flavours? A little too much on the plate.

If you don't know it by now, I'll call it out from bottom up; mashed potatoes, biscuit, tomato slice, spinach, bacon, griddled cheese, fried chicken breast.. and all drizzled with chipole cream sauce. It is definitely a brunch item, not breakfast. I have to say, I saw a someone else order it, but with the sauce on the side. Smart! French Toast: More like, french loaf. Again, massive insane portions. Only half was eaten. But I sampled this, and it was quite delicious. Probably one of the best french toast that I had. Chicken Salad Sandwich: By far the best chicken salad sandwich I have ever tried. Nice dill flavour, and moist chicken meat. The multigrain bread was excellent too. Fries were super hot and fresh. They had a bit of coating on them (very very lightly), and helped stay crispy until the end. You must try the waltermelon-kiwi lemonade. Very delicious, and thirst quenching.

I have yet to try a drink here that isn't scrumptious!!We ordered one of the egg platters. It was decent. Nothing memorable, but nothing wrong with it. The chicken and waffles is where this place goes incredibly downhill. For those that say the chicken is flavorful, I think you don't have tastebuds. The chicken is so bland, dry, and awful. The waffle was somehow also bad. I love bacon waffles, it's not like this place is the first place to have them (get them all the time at Original Pancake House), but the execution here was WAY off. The bacon wasn't small enough so you have major texture issues giong on. The waffle overall lacked that yummy sweetness you get from most waffles. It wasn't soft, it wasn't sweet, it basically tasted like dry white bread with huge pieces of extremely thick flavorless bacon in it. HUGE disappointment. We kept covering the plate with more and more syrup but there was no rescuing this pitiful excuse for chicken and waffles. My hubbie is from Georgia, I'm from TX. We eat chicken and waffles in the south all the time. We're familiar with how they should taste. Roscoe's in LA does an excellent freaking job.

What I got was a cinnamon pancake with full on apple slices inside and on top of it. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting this (mostly due to my having no clue about how big the pancake was going to be). It had a great flavor (although it's hard to mess up a pancake), and the eggs weren't over-cooked and dry like so many places have them either.All in all a very good experience and I would go back if not for anything else but to get another pancake that only fits in a pizza box.

Now, I've never had chicken and waffles so I really had no idea what I was in for, and man was I surprised! Two strips of bacon were cooked inside of each waffle! And the fried chicken? Probably one of the best pieces of fried poultry I've ever consumed. The bf reported back that his benedict was everything he had been hoping for and more.

We'd just missed what they considered the lunch portion of the day, so we were only presented with the dinner menu.

I was having Yelp withdrawls, instead of hitting up a usual suspect for the weekend like I have for the past several months, this time I needed to trysomething new so I had reason to post a new review. I am an aspiring writer you know. I've heard horror stories about the waits to get seated, but when we came in there was no wait at all. I'm guessing that must be during the breakfast rush, since we came in for dinner. The ambiance is not what I was expecting based on what I've heard. Outside, it does indeed look \"farm-like\", but the inside is a different story. The front half of the room was very ~hip~, the back half had a more intimate feel. I always thought the interior would match the exterior with the farm theme, but, like the tagline says, this is TWISTED farm food so that could be part of the point for all I know. And now, I will tell you all why this place is so \"sick.\"As we were reading over our menus, we were given these gargantuan biscuits smothered in honey. They looked delish, but they were a tad disappointing. They were crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside....until you get closer to the middle. At that point the biscuit gets quite dry, thank god for the whipped butter they give you on the side and all that honey residue on the plate. My mom ordered the Bacon Garlic-Mashed Potato burger with bacon cheddar mashed potatoes. Although she couldn't finish it, the burger wasn't too insane. The bacon mashed potatoes were AMAZING. They didn't give us any gravy though, but that was good enough by itself, I definitely know what I'm getting next time I go there. The burger was an unusual taste sensation, having mashed potatoes on it. It is quite tasty once you get used to it however. I ordered brinner: Eggs, smothered in cheese with sausage and crispy potatoes, on top of the Flapjack. Now THIS was sick. So sick. The pancake was the size of a SKILLET, and the waitress even had to hold my plate with two hands. Like I said earlier though, the pancake was sick in the most delicious way possible. I had about 3 bites of it before cutting it up into seven pieces to take it to go for the next day (which would be today. And I still haven't finished it). I was shocked about the potatoes. I figured they would be like hash browns, but they were hefty wedges sprinkled with onions and peppers. Salt and pepper did the trick to make them less bland, but they didn't work all that well as I tried to mix them up with the eggs and sausage. It still made for a tasty meal, and I was almost full after finishing up that. We were in and out of there in a little over an hour. Talk about swift service. The portion sizes may scare me a little bit, but they are a steal at these prices, and it's always nice to be able to make another meal out of restaurant leftovers.Delicious food? Great service?

The food is generally okay (I love a good biscuit, and that they can offer) but on this past visit I was not happy with my entree which was a smoked salmon benedict. It was basically a MOUNTAIN of heavy and dry components which did not mesh together well at all but most importantly, the salmon tasted really fishy. I'm a pescetarian so I know fish pretty well and there was something just not quite right with this salmon. So I take about two bites and stop. I had my husband taste it too just to be sure it wasn't in my head and he agreed. We are not complainers, but we felt they needed to know about the funky fish. Our server finally came by and noticed that I hadn't eaten much and asked if something was wrong, so we told her. She did ask if I wanted something else but I said I was okay. A few minutes later a manager stopped by to find out what the issue was, so we explained it to her as well. So, here's where this establishment went ALL WRONG...this manager proceeds to explain to us the entire process of how they \"smoke\" their salmon. She said their method is a little unique and \"not for everyone\" and that she didn't really care for it either. Um, really? That's how you're going to handle this? She didn't offer anything to make it right. We weren't demanding a free meal, or even a refund. We didnt ask for anything different and just wanted to explain that there could have been a problem with old fish.

For breakfast my bf and I had a local coupon that was $10 a $25 purchase for breakfast, so first off that was a really good deal. We showed up on an early Monday afternoon and there were some people but it wasn't packed (thank God). Our server was great, checking up on us often and in a friendly manner. I ordered the Rosemary Chicken Hash (again) which was wonderful (again), and my bf ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The entire time he was eating he had the greatest look of pleasure on his face, very much a foodgasm.For dinner our group of 4 showed up on a Monday night and the place was almost empty, perfect for us. I was very excited to try dinner at Hash House and was not disappointed. My bf had the Chicken and Waffles again as well as his sister, her bf had some sort of bowtie pasta (I can't remember the name but it looked good), and I had the Farmer's Pasta. HH certainly knows how to make innovative and delicious dishes. My dish had chicken over angel hair pasta with corn on the cob, potatoes, barley, and spinach, with all of this sitting in vegetable stock, and griddled parmesan cheese on top. The stock really made everything stay moist and it was delicious. I got full and had some leftovers.Only negative about our dinner experience is that our server was in training and it showed. I asked for a Root Beer and got Dr. Pepper instead... kind of hard to fudge something like that up, isn't it? He also poured a can of Guinness into a glass as if he were pouring water, so it was all fizz for quite a while. IMO, all food servers should be required to know how to pour beers properly. Third strike was how inattentive he was; he did not check up on us and we had to flag him down to replace the incorrect soda as well as take a simple request for some pepper. I am glad these were minor infractions and did not ruin our meal nor experience. We did leave him a tip though that implied \"you need to work on some things.\"Everyone loved their food and had leftovers to take. We also had a coupon that was $25 off a $50 dinner order.

I have never been to a breakfast place where EVERYTHING (and I do mean everything) was delicious.First let start off with the decor. This is a very nice place. Got a kinda old country/modern type feel. They have an outside patio in the front and also in the rear. The bathrooms are clean and quaint. Enough of that, on to the grub. I ordered the pancake tractor breakfast with a rudy red mimosa. My hubby ordered the corned beef hask skillet with coffee. I have pictures of the food but the mimosa was so damn good, I finished it before remembering to take pics. (sorry)My breakfast came with 2 eggs, potatoes and a pancake. Like I mentioned, I'm not a big breakfast eater, so I didn't want any meat. When my platter came (that's right, I said PLATTER), I couldn't do anything but buck my eyes. How big is this pancake, I asked the waitress. And I quote\" 18 inches\". When I tasted the food all I could say was ummm. They eggs tasted like they plucked them from up under a chicken they had out back. (don't know if they have a chicken house out back, but they were just that fresh!) The potatoes were awesome and the pancake tasted like buttermilk.My hubby food came but before that he couldn't stop talking about the coffee. Now let me tell you, my husband drinks coffee, I don't. All he could talk about before his food came was how good the coffee was. I'm serious, he would not shut up about this coffee. He made me try the coffee. It was ok but like I said, I'm not a coffee drinker.To quote my hubby, \"This is some damn good hash. The best I ever had\". My plate had so \u00a0much food on it 3 people could have ate with me. Even my husband had food left on his plate (and that's a surprise cause he usually don't leave anything!) The bill came out to $40 but it was well worth it. You will not be sorry.

I know that part of the schtick is to be over the top...with the portions, with the bacon, everything over the top...I get it. But at a certain point, it's just kind of wasteful. I can't believe this is me saying that, but Hash House took me there. The Sage Fried Chicken was delicious. I wish it weren't just breasts, though...moist, juicy thighs are where its at. I know what you're thinking, and cut it out. The tower of bacon waffles? Delicious, but why a tower? Who's gonna eat all these waffles? And don't get pissy when we need more syrup! The Grilled Meatloaf Hash was pretty good. Lots of meatloaf, fried potatoes, and red and yellow peppers. Huge amount of this hash next to a little mound of two scrambled eggs. I really like my eggs, and I felt bad that they were so outnumbered. Three eggs and half as much hash would suit me fine. The Bacon Bloody Mary. For the love of all that does not suck....I wanted to love it. I had so been looking forward to it. I don't know what the frig is going on in this world, but it seems to be a recent trend that everyone feels the need to make their Bloody Mary spicy as all hell. Hash House isn't just along for that ride, they bought the damned airline. IMO, Tabasco should *accent* the flavors in a Bloody, waking the whole thing up, leaving behind a slight spicy flavor that pleasantly lingers....it should not be a dominant, overwhelming aftertaste without the drink being ordered that way. Kind of like everything else here, it's just too over the top without needing to be so. Service was just fine, although I didn't quite dig the practice of going ahead and adding 18 percent gratuity under the line \"large party\". Since it was just two of us, they were either insulting us by calling us large, or insulting us because we're cheapskates that used their gift certificate offer on restaurants dot com. Either way, unappreciated. I'm in the industry, and you have to really suck to not get 20 percent and have that rounded up to the next dollar....even more if you don't suck. You were great, but you're saying 18 percent. So 18 percent it is, then.

(If you're coming here, try not to eat for the day because the servings are monstrous!)I have been to both this location as well as the one in Imperial Palace and would definitely recommend this one by far. (Imperial Palace had equally good food, but MUCH lower quality service). The decor is a bit different for both locations, with the Sahara location being much bigger, livelier, and more attentive service. As soon as we got there, we ordered. My boyfriend got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and I got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles....sorry, my mouth started watering just thinking about it.... The wait for our food was unbearable, mostly because waiters were walking by with pancake platters \u00a0with pancakes that took up the entire plate (about a foot in diameter)! I ordered a mimosa to ease my nerve. It was okay - too much champagne. Finally, our food came. Two plates of enormous proportions - my chicken and waffles were the size of my head! It looked really good, though: four bacon waffles, topped with perfectly fried chicken topped with a not-too-sweet maple glaze. (They had to drive a steak knife through it to make sure it didn't topple over). The chicken was tender, but fried in a bit of a spicy batter, which paired with the sweetness of the glaze, waffle, and bacon really well. Looking at his benedict, though, I had to take a sliver....which turned into half of his plate, haha. It was amazing! A perfect biscuit, topped with sage fried chicken, two eggs, bacon mashed potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. (Oh, and a slice of fruit to be healthy). The flavors came together so well! We ate so much, our stomachs looked like two balloons ready to burst. It was worth it, though. It's been a week, and I'm having withdrawals.

I appreciate the fried garnishes on top and the noticeable amount of rosemary in the crust as well. The filling was hot and soft and well-rounded. However, the crust was just okay to me and half the reason I get any kind of pie is for a good flaky crust. The crust in this pie was a bit too hard and cold. Maybe I missed some kind of memo that warned customers of the deviation from the norm.If I were to judge this place on just their Big 'Ol Chicken Pot Pie, I would have rated it a 4/5 but I also had the opportunity to taste their (nonalcoholic) Kiwi-Watermelon Lemonade and Strawberry Lemonade.

I'm sure glad I followed through on that suggestion! I had a wonderful dining experience. Excellent service, excellent food, excellent prices. I will definitely go back to any HH location, and recommend any of them without hesitation, just as my friend did.The morning I visited, the restaurant was quite busy, but the amazing hostess quickly got us seated in a nice booth, and our coffee was brought out promptly. I instantly fell in love with the fun and funky ambiance and the quirky, tatted waitstaff. Our waitress was as fantastic as her tattoos. She was fun, friendly, and so on top of it that we were the ones that had to ask her to wait - we needed some extra time to absorb the incredible menu. I had a very difficult time deciding, so since my friend had suggested the Sage Fried Chicken Egg Benedict ($15), that's what ended up ordering. I had been warned the portions were big, but until you see it with your own eyes, you cannot believe how gargantuan they truly are. A massive tower of sage fried chicken with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, grilled mozzarella, chipotle cream and eggs was deposited in front of me, and I actually gasped out loud, to the amusement of my waitress. Though I instantly realized there was no way I was going to be able to consume all of this feast and still have a functioning heartbeat, I happily gave it a try. It was an incredible breakfast. Every delicious ingredient tasted farm fresh, hand-prepared, and it was all perfectly cooked and seasoned. And it all tasted ... original! And different! And good! You can tell they make everything from scratch, because it tastes like it. Heck they even have house-made jam on the table... how awesome is that..??My dining companion had the Meatloaf Hash, which was a huge portion of amazing hash adorned with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, smoked mozzarella, and 2 perfectly cooked eggs. Rounding out this monster breakfast was a side of crispy potatoes, fruit and biscuit ($13). \u00a0Everything on this plate was also exceptionally flavorful and cooked very well.I've been to other restaurants famous for large portions, but their food always tastes like \"chain\" food, and you can never count on the service because of how busy the restaurant is. Not so with Hash House. These breakfasts are obviously individually prepared with great care and attention to detail, freshness and flavor, and they're served with pride and panache by a very well-trained staff. Every aspect of my breakfast, from the first cup of coffee to the last bite of fruit, was wonderful. I cannot think of one single aspect I would change about this restaurant, the staff, or the food. It was absolutely perfect.While a person couldn't (and shouldn't) eat a big breakfast or lunch like this all the time, occasionally enjoying one this tasty is a nice treat, especially if you're from out of town. So just like my friend urged me, I urge you to visit any Hash House location and give it a try. I'm sure you'll find, as I did, that you'll be very happy with the service, the prices, and most importantly, the wonderful food.NOTE: \u00a0Apparently, if you have Twitter and you tweet you're @HashHouseLV, \u00a0you get a free drink!", "Date": "2011-02-16", "Author_Location": "Portland, OR"}, {"Author": "Stephanie H.", "ReviewID": "EclAMXFlUNG1iIDZP3l7xw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Brewed Iced Tea - Yes.This one is so difficult to review. There are so many pros and cons about this place for me.Let's start with breakfast:4 stars for breakfastTheir notorious reputation for having big portions certainly applies to their breakfast dishes as well.I'm a big fan of biscuits and gravy.. and this place has good biscuits and gravy. \u00a0I also like their skillet plates.. I recall having one with chorizo and it was great. \u00a0There's lots of choices and often find myself trying pick one out of 3 or 4 dishes. \u00a0I also think the pricing is pretty reasonable.Now let's talk about dinner:3 stars for dinner.It's not that the food is bad, I think it's OK... the killer for me is the MASSIVE portions. \u00a0I get through almost 1/4th of the way through and have to throw the towel in. \u00a0I know there are many people out there that like to have leftovers, my bf being one of them, but I don't. \u00a0Especially when I'm bringing home left overs that will feed me more than twice.Another small gripe I have is that they are more focused with the presentation rather than the way the food should taste. \u00a0Examples: \u00a0*The asparagus isn't trimmed or peeled on the bottom.. so while you're eating and get to the woody part at the end you have to spit it out.*The fried pasta that decorates every plate isn't always fried. \u00a0I know many will push it to the side but I personally like it, so it sucks when I go to nibble on one and it's just hard raw pasta. \u00a0*The butternut (in the butternut risotto dish) isn't peeled. \u00a0It's not a potato, you can't eat the skin.Overall I'd rather come here for breakfast than dinner, but this is just one of those places you bring a group of friends to (especially out of town friends) and just have fun. \u00a0It also helps being able to grab a certificate from restaurant.com before coming.(FYI - the restaurant . com certificates only work for dinner, not breakfast.)", "Date": "2008-12-31", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Daniel T.", "ReviewID": "QZzcwLFLQ4df3YLyzbiIDA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I was in Vegas this past weekend and my friend wanted to try out this place before heading out to OC.

Damn was that pancake good although I only finished about 20% of it. M had the Basic or Original Breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon or ham and potatoes. Still GIGANTIC for a mere $8.95 price tag. Our server was great if not a bit harried due to the overwhelming crowds due to a biker convention in town! I took my dear Flapjack to go and tore a few pieces off later to munch on before sending the remaining bits into the ye olde hotel room trashcan.

While the rest of my party who went here may not have liked what they ordered, I loved the food. We went here because the driver of the other car, who was the organizer of the trip, saw it on tv on Drivers, Dine-Ins, and Dives, and said it looked good. We arrived in Vegas and set about finding this restaurant based on general directions from the other driver. Honestly, if you're not paying attention to the signs on the right side of the road (heading eastbound on Sahara) you can easily miss this location. The location opens at 730, and we arrived here at about 6am. We pretty much spent an hour and a half sleeping in the car. The menu is simple, however it would do good to have photos of all that you would be ordering. What you may not realize when you first come to this restaurant is that the portions are very generous. What I mean by this is that two of our people ordered a pancake combination. When you order pancakes, you think that they'd be like IHOP pancakes or like McDonald's hotcakes, but this thing, according to the server, was about the size of a medium pizza. He sure as hell wasn't kidding! I mean, that thing was the size of a newborn! Two people shared one of the pancake platters, and the other person gave up on eating the pancake without eating it. (I wolfed the whole thing down in about two minutes for him) Two other people ordered a Hash House combination plate, which I believe was hashed potatoes and some green pepper and sausage pieces. One ate most of it, the other person finished only a small portion of it, and shared with the rest of the people on our side of the booth.My coworker ordered a waffle platter, and finished only one corner of a waffle and part of his hashed potatoes. He saved the rest in case we were hungry later on in the day. The driver of the other car ordered what I believe was Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. When it came out, it looked about the size of a small child's head. The chicken portion that I cut through (to get a bite) was boneless and covered in a delicious sauce. With my help and the help of some of the other people on the table, we finished a little under half of the platter. The item that I ordered was the One Pound Hash House Mushroom and Swiss Stuffed Burger with a side of Fries. When the burger came out, It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. The hamburger patties had the swiss/mushroom mixture oozing out of the middle, and it pretty much dwarfed the hamburger bun. It came with the fries, about four fried spaghetti sticks, and around the plate, there was this caramel type texture sauce. Even with the help of three other people, we only managed to eat under half of the burgers. The restaurant began to get much more busier by the time we left, as more persons were beginning to come in to eat the food. The server was very pleasant and came by pretty often to check up on us.

We were sat pleasantly enoughh, but that's it as far as the positives. Our server was overwhelmed, and we weren't even acknowledged for quite some time.

One or two small items, no problem, but everything going poorly? Not good.I ordered the chicken and asparagus hash with eggs, and my girlfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles. We didn't receive our food for at least 30 minutes, and when it came out, only mine came. The server said: \"We're going to start you with the chicken and asparagus hash,\" like it was an appetizer or something. Funny.After at least five minutes and my girlfriend's food having not arrived, I tried to find our waiter, but he was nowhere to be found. I flagged down another waiter and asked to see a manager. He arrived a couple minutes later and I asked him where my girlfriend's order might be, and he assured me it would be right out. Several minutes later, my girlfriend's fried chicken and waffles arrived.The food: The coating was delicious, as was the maple syrup reduction. The chicken was very, very dry, however, and the waffles were soggy. My dish lacked seasoning and was actually quite bland.

The first is at 6800 West Sahara Blvd. just East of Rainbow Blvd. The second is in the Imperial Palace Hotel & Casino located at 3535 Las Vegas Blvd S. The third location is in the M Resort and Casino located at 12300 Las Vegas Blvd. S in Henderson. And the newest is at the Plaza Hotel and Casino at the end of Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. They have a great menu for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Come dine for breakfast on a 'Roasted Chicken, garlic, onion, asparagus and Rosemary' Hash for only $12.95.Or dine on one of their famous one pound burgers like the 'Apple Smoked Bacon and Mashed Potato' burger also for only $12.95. No need for side dishes with this one, even though it comes with a ton of fries. (Prices are subject to change) How about for dinner you try one of their 'Sage Fried Chicken Linguine'. All of their food is great to eat and easy on the wallet.They say that they serve \"Twisted Farm Food\". I'm not sure if I would call it twisted, but it is some of the best I have had. Not only is the food some of the best, I have to say that the servers are some of the best as well. My beverage was never empty and when they asked if I needed something more I never felt as if I were being pressured. They truly wanted to help me. Even if they were just pretending, I could not see it.

The corned beef hash was simpler than the Boston hash with long strings of beef mixed with cheese on top of potatoes. It also came with the same scrambled eggs and big biscuit.This is not an old school diner, but an updated version. For example, I had a very nice tangerine juice. Divey diners don't serve fresh juice - let alone tangerines. But let's be clear, it's still diner food. I think customers are overly fascinated with the portion size and ignoring the quality of the food. Take the Boston Hash I had.

I didn't notice the cyclopean heaps of steaming food on every table - I guess I was too wrapped up in conversation or something. But I doubt that as I rarely have much to say.I decided on the mashed potato and bacon stuffed hamburger while my girlfriend went with the salmon and a large glass of tangerine juice - a particular favorite of hers and hard to find on many menus. Then a neighboring table received their order - pork chops. Looking past the gargantuan pile featured on the plate I saw that one side dish was an entire ear of corn. I began to panic.Considering the amount of food served up, our orders came quickly and cheerfully from our server. Regret over my choice immediately consumed me and yet, I was excited by the prospect of attempting to consume approximately fourteen pounds of food in one sitting. The stack of my hamburger stood seven inches off the table's surface. I concluded right away that the fluffy bun on top could not be more than decoration, not intended to be consumed, like a garnish, and so it was discarded.The menu stated crispy fries came with the burger. I was expecting thin, hard sticks of fried potato, but these fries were among the best I've ever had. Light and crispy on the outside, perfectly chewy on the inside with just enough grease to qualify as a french fry. It's too bad I couldn't finish them since the rest of the meal consisted of a two quarter-acre hamburger patties sandwiching a full liter of mashed potatoes.It was easily the biggest hamburger I've ever seen that wasn't on TV trying to break a record. Knowing all too well that no human any smaller than Andre the Giant could pick this monstrosity up and take a bite out of it with their mere mortal mouth, Hash House supplied a huge steak knife stuck through the top of the so-called \"sandwich.\" I am more likely to call it what it is - a gastrointestinal assassin, a destroyer of mens' spirits. The taste of the thing should not be in question. I will leave flowery descriptions of its taste and color and texture and the subtle hints of.... whatever to the real foodie types of Yelp. I am here to relate the experience, that is all.About 1/3 of the way into my behemoth of beef and bacon and mashed potatoes, the waitress asked how we were doing. Words escaped me at first, so I nodded too enthusiastically, trusting her not to think I was choking. Perhaps I was chewing. Maybe I was catching my breath mid-forkful. But then I had to ask, \"Are these supposed to be shared between two people? Have I misunderstood the whole CONCEPT of the restaurant?\" She assured me no, these are meant for individual consumption. It's sort of like Man vs. Food with every item on the menu. I threw my napkin down in defeat. My white flag draped across the seat.Somehow I kept eating for a long time, as did my date. We both managed to finish about 2/3 of our plates. I'm no competitive eater, but I feel that I can put food away. More than one person has told me I eat like I'm in the Army. Don't think, just keep shoveling it in. But the food won. During my stay at the Hash House, I didn't see anyone clean their plate. The pork chop lady needed more than one box to bring her leftovers home. I would have taken mine back if only my hotel room included a microwave oven in the same drawer as the Gideon Bible.I left the restaurant broken and slightly limping, but happy, sated.

I decided this was a good thing, because you usually get better service.They bring out biscuits that look like they were baked in a cake pan. Whipped butter, honey. The biscuits are amazing, but very filling.The menu is overwhelming. I was told to order the Sage Chicken and waffles with maple reduction. I decided against it. I ordered the Boston Hash, which was severely disappointing. I love potatoes in any form. I didn't remember seeing \"scrambled eggs\" on the description, but they were on my plate. There was some asparagus, too. The fresh fruit was nowhere near ripe. My friends ordered the ribs, a huge chicken salad with bacon, and the salmon. They were HUGE (But I felt that the plates used for the ribs and the salad should be switched)! Mine seemed more reasonable, which is what I was going for.The crab cake was no good. They need to use less bread crumbs and more crab. The potatoes should be cut into smaller pieces. The mixture of the potatoes/tomatoes did not work for me, possibly due to the fact that the potatoes were covered in seasoning and the tomatoes were just plain and unnecessary.They are famous for their huge portions and odd pairings. One thing I did not understand was the branch of rosemary stuck somewhere on every plate they brought out.The service was horrible. I was eating with 3 people that have worked in the restaurant/service industry before. One of them for 10 years. We all agree that it was horrible service. He was a jerk. It's called HASH House, you'd think it wouldn't be a problem to substitute one sort of chicken for the other on a SALAD. The waiter was an asshole about it. Very abrupt and never checked on us. I gave him the worst tip I've ever given and didn't feel bad. In addition, I couldn't use my coupon because I was like $3 short of $50. Instead of telling me to order a side to go or put a dessert on the bill in order to use the $25 coupon, he ran my card anyway. A good server would've suggested that.I'm not sure if I want to come back.

Fresh corn, green beans, asparagus, scrambled eggs, and fruit also came with the dish. One small gripe was the cheese that covered the dish was a bit too heavy for me. Otherwise, great flavors!+ Boston Hash ($14.95) - The crab cake was pretty good, and the horseradish cream was not overpowering. The tomatoes in the hash made the potatoes a little soggy though. Dish came with asparagus, fruit, and scrambled eggs. + Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict ($14.95) - Wow! This dish was awesome! The pork was so moist. I couldn't believe the size of the pork. The creamy sauce was yummy too. Also comes with a biscuit at the bottom.+ Grilled Portabello Mushroom Sandwich ($12.95) - I didn't get to try the sandwich, but I heard that it wasn't bad.

It came with a steak knife stabbed in the middle holding it together. \u00a0I had the cob salad platter - errrrr I mean plate. \u00a0Big chunks of everything in it including a whole avocado and a biscuit about the size of a softball.A lot of people were gawking at other tables food orders cause they were all huge. \u00a0One guy at a table behind us just stared at his plate for awhile before he figured out how to attack it. \u00a0The prices aren't too bad, but you get food enough and then some for what you pay. \u00a0Come hungry - leave happy and waddling off. \u00a0Good times!!!", "Date": "2010-08-09", "Author_Location": "Powell, OH"}, {"Author": "Katherine A.", "ReviewID": "di_0F1-aTe4LShCkmYOASg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After watching Man vs Food, I really, really wanted to love this place.

I haven't sampled as many items as I have on the breakfast menu but I definitely recommend the crispy cornmeal salmon sandwich. The wheat bun and chili mayo really make this sandwich sing. Love it.

Being in Las Vegas and knowing that Sin City has its very own Hash House (three in fact), there was no way I was going to miss a taste of home.Arriving at a time that would cause a 45 to 90 minute wait at the San Diego location, I was surprised to be told that I would be seated in between 15 and 20 minutes. Happily taking my pager, I shuffled off to wait and in due course was buzzed.Setting my sights on a \"Campfire s'mores\" mocha ($7) which arrived in an over-sized cup (visibly cracked as seen in the picture) topped with gooey, charred marshmallows, chocolate syrup and Graham crackers.The first spoonful was thick with marshmallowy goodness and its smokey, crunchy crust brought me immediately back to childhood outings in the woods by the campfire, roasting s'mores with family and friends. If the coffee itself had been better, this mocha would have been perfect but it falls just short of the mark.Having had many of the offerings on the standard menu over the years, I decided I'd order one of the brunch specials. The Nappanee hash ($14.95) with fresh tomatoes, green beans, marinated steak, smoked mozzarella and crispy potatoes was ordered and anticipated.Things began going pear shaped when I asked my server If I could add fresh roasted corn (available in the other brunch offering), to my hash and was told \"the Chef can't guarantee the flavor profile if changes are made so we don't allow substitutions or additions.\" FAIL!In due course my server arrived clutching a medium sized cast iron skillet in a heavy oven mitt. What a great idea, the cast iron would keep my food hot and steamy while I enjoyed it...WRONG! The skillet seems to have been used solely for presentation and not preparation, it was stone cold and after a bite, I realized temperature of my meal was not far off. FAIL!The \"marinated steak\" was a perfectly cooked medium but lacked flavor. The green beans, which I felt were a strange choice for a breakfast dish, were a bit too al dente and the whole skillet lacked seasoning. Curiously, the server pointed out the days freshly made strawberry citrus jam and asked if I would like butter to go with it and my buttermilk biscuit to which I replied \"yes,\" but somehow said butter never materialized. FAIL!In all the meal was mediocre, there were several opportunities to meet or exceed expectations but none were taken advantage of. \u00a0 The server could have noticed the large, clearly visible crack in my coffee mug, \u00a0If cast iron was to be used for presentation only, there's no reason it couldn't have been warmed so as to keep its contents at the desired temperature and \u00a0finally, when asked to add roasted corn to the dish, the server could have suggested i have it on the side instead of basically telling me the Chef understands my palate better than I do.I have a warm place in my heart for Hash House a Go Go and have recommended breakfast/brunch there to many friends and acquaintances alike, I can only hope that this particular meal was an aberration.", "Date": "2010-11-11", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Mike L.", "ReviewID": "C3aI9pwbGLgOJC_rd6Ah9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We came here earlier in the day and it was packed so we left.

My fave part of the dish was the deep fried green onion shavings. Ingenious touch - complimenting taste and excellent texture. My only (minor) issue with the dish is that I prefer my waffles a darker golden brown and crispy but it was still damn good.The hot granola with fruit was nothing close to what I had expected.

I can best describe it as sweet, gooey goodness with berries and sliced peaches mixed into it. It was also topped with big sliced of bananas, strawberries, watermelon, etc. It was really good but so bad for you.

The hostess was busy seating someone when I came in, but the very nice lady at the bar informed me she'd be right back. I was seated within 5-minutes of walking in the door. A fantastic start.My server was Tiffany, same woman from the bar when I entered. She was so nice and friendly and has a great sense of humor (as I asked her if she was stalking me). She took my drink order and let me look at the biiig menu. I had gone in to the restaurant craving BBQ, but saw the Chicken and Waffles on the menu and had to have them. As I waited for my meal to arrive, someone brought me the HHAGG (horrible acronym) version of pre-meal bread. A Big-Ass-Biscuit (no, they didn't call it that). Buttermilk biscuit with honey glaze on it served with whipped honey butter and honey on the side. I only took a couple of bites because I saw the dishes coming out for other diners and I knew I'd better not eat the whole thing. Flavor of the biscuit was good. It was, however, a bit on the dry side.My meal showed up and I had to bust out laughing. Seriously? That is one giant tower of food. All held together with a giant skewer and a knife stabbed through it. Tiffany said they 'don't mess around'. clearly!And here's where the mixed emotions come in. The chicken was definitely missing something. I wish I knew what, but it was just so bland. I thought perhaps I was missing some nuance of flavor, so I took a moment to drink some water and pulled a piece of just chicken. The meat was just slightly dry and completely void of flavor. Huh? I tore off some of the fried skin/coating and tired that, which was also bordering on flavorless. How could this be? I can see flecks of .. well .. something in the coating. I don't get it. Bummer.The Waffles, however, were heaven. Waffles with bacon cooked right inside, covered in syrup. Mmmmm. Sweet and salty heaven. If I could have had just a plate of those waffles, I'd have been a happy soul. Tiffany mentioned that they sometimes have a pancake with bacon AND chocolate chips in it. Holy Cow! I'd love to try that.I would definitely come here again, preferably with several hungry friends that all order something different and are willing to share tastes. And I'd probably ask to sit in Tiffany's area because she was a real superstar, fun and friendly.", "Date": "2010-04-01", "Author_Location": "Venice, CA"}, {"Author": "Jonathan C.", "ReviewID": "wOd50FgLb7L4SzqhNDNogA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Solid 4 just like the one in my hometown of san diego.Ordered the man vs food fried chicken concoction.

Each time we've gone to the M location, the service has been spot-on, our food has come out at the same time and of course, the food is ginormous and good.The Sahara location is the pits. We went on a Saturday night and they seemed to be understaffed so we waited about 30 minutes for a table in spite of the dining room being only about half full.We waited about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. As we were waiting, we glanced around at what some of the other diners were enjoying. When the waitress came back with our drinks, I asked her a couple of (I thought) fairly simple questions about the menu. My husband also wanted to know what the people next to us ordered because it looked and smelled delicious.The waitress walked over to the other table and asked them what it was. We were slightly more than a little embarrassed. The waitress didn't know the answers to the questions I asked, either.Negative five points for menu knowledge.Then, when our meals came out, my husband got his first. Being the gentleman he is, he waited for our son and me to get ours. And we waited. And we waited. After about 10 minutes, mine came out. We asked the server, very politely, if the kitchen knew anything about the proper firing of meals because we had never experienced this at another location. The server, while holding my plate in his hand the whole time, proceeds to argue with my husband and tell us that since the kitchen doesn't use any heat lamps, they brought out food whenever it was ready. Which is all fine except that just the week prior at the M location, I went to lunch with a group of 15 people and our meals all came out within a couple of minutes of each other.But back to the Sahara location. The server continues to argue with us and finally just stops talking. Standing there. Glaring at us. After a few seconds of this I looked at him and asked, \"May I please have my dinner plate or are you going to continue to hold it hostage?\" At which point, he thumped it down on the table in front of me.Did I mention that the restaurant manager walked by at least twice during this and didn't say a word? Did I also mention that our son STILL did not have his dinner?And at this point, both my husband's food and my food are cold. Then comes my son's hamburger. All told, three meals over the course of about 20 minutes. Without a word from our waitress, drink refills or the manager stopping by.I will concede that my husband's bloody marys are always good. My grilled cheese sandwich, though cold, was still tasty. And my son said his hamburger was okay but nothing special.We would much rather take the extra 30-40 minutes out of our lives and go to the one inside M, where they actually appreciate their customers and have common sense when it comes to firing food in the kitchen.", "Date": "2012-06-23", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "morgan s.", "ReviewID": "31uzVmBltRWMAdNuT1qsAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The kiwi watermelon lemonade. omg.", "Date": "2013-09-16", "Author_Location": "Palm Desert, CA"}, {"Author": "earle s.", "ReviewID": "c0oDaCSJiNeQ2qg71qmL0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "People aren't kidding when they talk about the portion sizes.

I felt that lettuce was a bit wilted and flavors were not as full as they should have been. Very average at best for the salad.Of course we tried waffles and chicken for dinner!!! This dish was more fun then super delicious, however with the humongous portion sizes and many stalks of sage, I got to love this dish' homey flavors and how can you not like the \"baked in bacon\" in the huge waffle?

Let's start with first impressions. \u00a0Forget \"line was out the door,\" it was more like MOB surrounding the front patio. \u00a0Once inside, you're greeted with such a busy atmosphere (on a weekend, at least) - all the tables were seated, families and friends getting together for a breakfast-version of Thanksgiving. \u00a0If you haven't worked out those forearm muscles, not sure if this place would be for you. \u00a0Their plates are ginormous (yes, this word has been officially quantified due to the portion sizes at Hash House). \u00a0I would like to invest in whatever machinery they use to squeeze the orange juice. \u00a0\"Fresh\" is an understatement. \u00a0That cup of orange juice is so amazing - it's as if someone took an orange, magically stirred up the juices inside an orange (without disturbing the peel), gave me a straw and offered me heavenly orange juice. \u00a0I was mesmerized by the juice, as I watched the pulp inside the glass, sway back and forth, taunting me with its citrusy-goodness, waiting for me to finish the entire cup, and ask for seconds or thirds. \u00a0I resisted - for I waited patiently for the food. \u00a0It's hard to not turn heads every time a server came by with a plate. \u00a0Every plate looked like a mountain of food, with a twiggy-herb sticking up, followed by \"Holy gamoly, that plate is HUGE!\" \u00a0Pancakes looked like they were used as blankets to keep the plates from getting cold. \u00a0If it's true that you eat with your eyes first, you better close your eyes before the plates arrive at your table - you'd be full just by watching the plates make their way to the tables! When the sage fried chicken and waffles showed up, I was amazed the table didn't tip over to one side. \u00a0The waffles piled against one another like mattresses, lending support the pieceS of fried chicken that sat so gallantly on top. \u00a0Once you cut into the waffles, bits of bacon are nestled inside the waffles, playing peek-a-boo, and tickles you with savory flavors to off-set the maple syrup, while making you yearn for the juicy fried chicken. \u00a0I'm telling you, it was all very well thought out. \u00a0Four out of five stars is fair. Second attempt - featured menu item: Nappanee Hash. \u00a0Potatoes, tomatoes, strips of beef, eggs, (and other ingredients that I cannot remember) all glued together by Smoked Mozarella. \u00a0The potatoes were nicely crisped around the edges, eggs were made to order, and tomatoes danced around the combination, teasing with freshness. \u00a0Among the different flavor combinations came the strips of beef. \u00a0Problem - they were just that: BEEF. \u00a0If we did role call, the character \"flavor\" would be followed by silence, because it was completely absent. \u00a0\"Tenderness?\" \u00a0-- nice try. \u00a0That too, was absent. \u00a0Two out of five. \u00a0As busy as I've seen this place, I would think that they would want more servers/waiters to make sure that the tables are flipped as quickly as possible. \u00a0Service is a little bit on the slow side - and this is not just applied to the busy days. \u00a0On a day where there were no more than 6-tables, it took two or three attempts before we could get the waiter's attention to place an order. \u00a0Three out of five. \u00a0If you don't have much patience for long lines (on the weekends) or slower service, steer clear. \u00a0If you've got a big group of (hung-over) people looking for some not-so-fancy foods at big quantities and little price, you're in good hands at the Hash House. \u00a0If you're just tired of really watered down orange juices from the Poker tables at the Rio, just follow that holy-looking-glowing light to the Hash House A Go Go.", "Date": "2010-09-06", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Neil E.", "ReviewID": "FG1eyRmjg6b84pZzkdJKjw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went for breakfast our first morning in Vegas.

If you are looking for a brunch place on Saturday where you can actually hear the person sitting next to you, not the place to go. First, being 10:30am on a Saturday, there was a 30 minute wait for first available (inside or outside). There's minimal spots to sit inside so we had to wait out in the chill. When finally seated inside, a DJ was blasting Lady Gaga so loud, I couldn't hear what my five year old nephew sitting right next to me wanted to order. This \"club-esque\" music lasted most of the breakfast and was a very irritating. Maybe I missed the \"Saturday Brunch Party\" memo.I split a decent $8.50 Bloody Mary with my sister that came with a green bean, stuffed olive, and sweet pickle. I ordered what I thought was the \"Warsaw Hash\" which was a Brunch special they had for $10.95. After waiting 25 minutes for our food, the portion was pretty sizeable and I ended up taking half of it home. The quality, however, was a little bland. There were big chunks of ground Turkey and pieces of bacon and melted cheese on potatoes. Nothing amazing. I did try my nephew's cinnamon french toast and that was pretty yummy.Overall I found the place a mix of hipsters, hipster wannabes, and trendy yuppies looking for a place \"cool\" to eat at.

NOT THIS LAST TIME THOUGH.Smores Mocha: Are you F'n kidding me? \u00a0First it comes in an oversized mug (surprise). It's a mocha which marshmallow fluff on top that's browned and then garnished with two pieces of graham cracker. \u00a0It's very sweet, so I'm not sure if it's an option, but an extra shot would probably be the only recommendation I could give to make this any better.Caramel Mocha (?)- not sure of the name, but it comes in a tall glass that makes it look like a shake because it's topped with a bunch of whipped cream which is toped with drizzled caramel and chocolate. \u00a0Like the above drink, very tasty, but very sweet. \u00a0I like my coffee STRONG, so I'd add an extra shot next time if possible.I believe there are at least 4 locations in vegas, The M, The Plaza, The Imperial Palace and this one. \u00a0I like this one because it's a free standing building well off the strip, so I avoid a little of the Vegas madness. \u00a0It gets packed pretty early. \u00a0If you think you're going to sleep till 9 and show up and get a table at 10 like every other lazy ass, you're mistaken. \u00a0You need to COMMIT TO BREAKFAST, wake up early and show up as close to opening (i believe it's 7:30am) as possible.If you go to Vegas and don't eat breakfast here, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.", "Date": "2012-07-14", "Author_Location": "Palmdale, CA"}, {"Author": "Tiffany B.", "ReviewID": "LDcu4JkhE2-GVcdDJY4nQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Delicious!

Came to this location last Sunday for brunch. It was very busy considering that it was around 1:30 pm. This is the only hash house that is located in a single standing building. The others are within hotels/casinos. \u00a0The wait took about 40 minutes for a table for 4. Our waitress, Erin, had a very flat affect straight from the start. She wasn't very friendly nor helpful. \u00a0I asked her if the couples could split the bill and she said it would be fine. We ordered our entrees, which consisted of the sun dried tomatoes, basil and goat cheese farm scrambles, buttermilk flapjacks and the French toast. All were very tasty and had good portions. One of the downfalls to the food was the amount of syrup they gave with the French toast and flapjacks. They gave a tiny shot glass worth of syrup for each dish. We had to ask for extra syrup about 3 times because these dishes needed the syrup. So when the bill comes, it had not been split, so I quickly reminded her to split the bill. I was going to mention which dishes on the credit cards but she replied \"I know what dishes you guys got\" in a very rude tone. Yeeesh. She looked at my boyfriend and asked which card was his. He told her his name. The other couple's card had his picture on it. So when she returns with the split bills, she still managed to screw everything up and mix up the items with the cards. At this point, I was quite frustrated so I went back to look for her and just told her what had happened. She apologized but it honestly didn't seem like she cared. \u00a0We wanted to leave so we just signed the bills without changing them and left. This experience left a sour taste in my mouth. The service at the other hash houses are pretty good.

Two breasts with drummies and about two full waffles with the bacon cooked into the waffle. Making this to order took about 20+ minutes for it to get to the table and it was worth it.

After months of lusting over the Chicken Benedict after seeing it on Food Network I could hardly wait, Too bad I had to. We got there around 11am on a Thursday and the place was pretty packed inside. The hostess was friendly and quoted the wait around 30 minutes unless we wanted to sit outside. Being hung-over and starved we chose the patio and thats where the experience became unpleasant. Our waitress was cool but it took her 10-15 minutes to bring us our drinks and being that we hit the sheets around 5 that morning we needed that coffee and water badly. I ended up ordering the Boston Hash because at the time it sounded amazing, and my bro got the Fried Chicken Benedict so I was just gonna steal bites from him. Our friend just got some scrambled eggs and we ordered one of those giant pancakes to split.After we ordered we got to talking about the night before and kind of lost track of time before I realized our food was taking wayyy too long. I was able to estimate exactly how long from a text my bro sent as we were ordering and it was going on 36 minutes and we still hadn't seen a plate. After I caught up to the waitress she assured me the food was coming and after another 5 minutes it did.The plates looked delicious! Everything was piled high, too bad the quality didn't match the quantity! My crab cakes just weren't good at all, they had a good amount of crab but just weren't that tasty, and the horseradish cream that came with it didn't help. Plus my potatoes were soggy and burnt tasting! I tasted my bros Benedict and while it was better than my breakfast it wasn't stellar, the pancake was kinda dry and seemed like it was cooked way before it was brought out. The best thing about the meal was the watermelon kiwi lemonade I ordered and to add insult to injury it took us another 20 minutes to catch a cab out of there.

There was a 30 minute wait which gave me more than enough time to look over the menu so that I could be ready to order once we sat down.For drinks we ordered the Watermelon Kiwi Limeade and the Smores Espresso. Both drinks were amazing and I would highly recommend both. However, just know that there are no refills on specialty limeades.For food we ordered the Trucker Combo with the Snickers Flapjack and the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The snickers flapjack was enormous! It was probably larger than my face, it was larger than the plate it was served on. It came with 2 eggs and sausage. Very filling combo with a nice sweet touch added from the snickers. I had a few bites of the Fried Chicken meal. This combo was an enormous serving of fried chicken, bacon, biscuits and mashed potatoes. The meal as a whole tasted pretty good but I would have to say that on an individual level, I was a bit disappointed in the chicken. The chicken was supposed to be the highlight of the dish but it unfortunately tasted the most bland. All in all, I wouldn't mind going back to Hash House A Go Go but it probably won't always be at the top of my list of choices simply because the type of food served is something that can be found at other establishments and I am just not over my disappointment in the fried chicken.

One of my friends mentioned he saw Hash House A Go Go on Man vs. Food and wanted to check it out. Little did we know the entire city of Vegas had the same idea. We went on Sunday at noon. There was an hour wait for a table of five. I was fine with the wait since that probably meant the place was good. We put our names on the list and went next door to Vamp'd for a drink while we waited. I recommend doing this if the wait is more than an hour. Vamp'd is a rocker bar. Lots of rock memorabilia on the walls, guitars, chopper behind the bar, and a coffin telephone booth (kind of cool, but creepy when you get in it). Very cool place to check out. And it made our wait go by fast. Hash House tells you their pagers sometimes don't work next door, but we didn't have a problem. Our table was ready, but they wouldn't seat us without our entire party. Two of us stayed at Vamp'd to pay our bill, which took 5 minutes. Good thing it didn't take longer because they were ready to give up our table. \u00a0Just be ready when your pager goes off!!! We sat down and it took a few minutes for our waiter to come over. Once he did, he was very helpful. I thought the ambiance was great. Everything that passed our table looked delicious! It was a tough decision on what to get. I ordered the roasted Chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary House Hash. Our food took about a half hour. When my food came out barely warm, slightly cold I was a little disappointed. The Manager on duty came over and gladly had the cook make me a new dish. Mine was good, the chicken was a little dry. Could have used some sauce. There is A LOT OF FOOD for one person to eat. I highly recommend sharing a meal if your not a big eater. Or get a to-go box and give it to a bum. I would definitely go back. I think they have a lot of creative dishes.

It's a huge piece of boneless chicken on top of a buttermilk biscuit, topped with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, bacon and mozzarella cheese. It comes with a side of griddled (mashed) potatoes. It is all drizzled in a chipotle cream sauce, which is a little spicy. IT IS HUGE!! You will be eating leftovers! For lunch I like the one pound stuffed hamburgers with a side of au gratin potatoes.

There were three of us and we are quite petite, so we could have just ate ONE plate. Talk about deal steal.It was at about 1:00pm on Labor Day that we reached to the restaurant. They still handed us the breakfast menu. (I didn't know they had other menus until looking at their website- Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner). So, we heard that this place \u00a0had HUGE portions. They are not kidding. We ordered two plates: The oh so famous Sage Fried Chicken with Waffles. They stab the chicken pieces onto to the waffles. Since I am Chinese it wasn't very pleasing to the eye that there is a knife stabbed right into the chicken (signifying death) but the flavors compensated for that! We also ordered the Roasted Chicken. The Roasted Chicken came with a watermelon, two eggs, hash browns, and asparagus. Both chicken tasted basically the same except for the skin textures. I must say the fried chicken was the best even though it is a bit dry. The waffles were really good and it does not compare to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles back in Los Angeles! It's also quite cheap since it is $15.00 per plate on average! This restaurant is one of the best OUTSIDE (and probably the BEST priced) in Las Vegas. Definitely a must try.

Food is really rich and I even try to order things with tons of veggies to make it a little healthier, but avoid this place if you're dieting. My qualms with this place (besides the touristy feel now) is that the service is really hit or miss. This seems to be a brand-wide issue because service is the same here and at their location in the M Resort. Hostesses all have attitudes, servers sometimes are completely attentive and sometimes they will drop by the table twice, to take your order and to drop off your bill. There isn't much they can do about being busy, or having an influx of visitors at this location, but they can certainly hold their staff to a high standard.", "Date": "2013-11-27", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Darren K.", "ReviewID": "OPj7Xttdeb7RaQOqMFq32w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hash House A Go Go is one of my favorite establishments for monstrous sized breakfast dishes. \u00a0The place is actually great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner so you can't go wrong by choosing Hash House a Go Go.

Some of the dishes that we ordered included the following: HH Famous Meatloaf, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Corned Beef House Hash, Griddled French Toast, Roasted Pork Tenderloin, and Chicken and Waffles. My favorite was the Griddled French Toast; it was airy and fluffy, with a nice crisp at the edges. It included baked bananas drizzled with banana cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup. The combination was absolutely orgasmic and I highly recommend it! Another dish that stood out was the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The benedict came with sort of scrambled eggs, versus the typical poached egg that I am used to. It was different, but delicious. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the sauce was unique and flavorful.The portions were humungous and very nicely presented.

It's like a roller coaster or a hot temptress. You know it's bad for you, but you still want it. Hash is definitely a true battle of Man verse food. They contribute to our the great over-sized nation of ours. Please check your diets at the door. I was extremely excited to try out Hash House, because all the reviews I read made it sound so amazing. It is very hard to find a great place for breakfast in Vegas. I was tired of waiting in a huge line at Paris Buffet, so I thought it's time to go on a Man vs. Food trip. Most of the time, I cannot stand places that have too much hype. Most things that are over hyped usually suck like the Crapple iphone and Verizon's I CAN'T hear you now network. Also, In-N-Out... It's good, but not crack like most people say it is.. (I don't endorse or use crack). Even though, I tried to come here without the high expectations, it was unavoidable. I felt like a little kid on Christmas morning. First off I am not a idiot! A lot of the bad reviews I read were from people that waited 2 hours and didn't like their food. I'm sorry, but if you waited 2 hours to eat anywhere I would be bitter too! I only waited 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes max, so suck on that! Haha. I went on a weekday around 9am. Brilliant!!!!I know the portions are big, but how's the quality? Did you finish dish by yourself? I don't like pigging out should I still go?The key is bring a friend and share. The quality is good! Don't expect a 5 star restaurant or a new cuisine from a top chef. This is simple breakfast food on steroids. I highly recommend having 2 stomachs and consulting with a doctor before coming here. To my surprise the customer base was a lot smaller than I expected. The restaurant was packed shortly after I arrived, but there were no Plus sized models here. I saw some normal sized patrons and a few gorgeous model types. I really was set on trying the Sage Chicken Benedict, but since my friend was not a fan of hollandaise sauce I went with the Chicken and Waffles of course! Let's just say Roscoe's has nothing on Hash House! I thought Roscoe's clogged arteries, but Hash made Roscoe's look like a Diet Soda verses a Milk Shake. The Chicken was very juicy and extremely crispy! I really like the corn flake batter, although the spices were a bit lacking, but nothing hot sauce can't fix. The chicken cannot beat Roscoe's, but that's not a fair comparison. You definitely get 4 times the food of Roscoe's for the same price. I am very picky Fried Chicken eater, so I wish they would find some Grandma's secret recipe for Chicken so this dish could become 10 instead of a 7. The waffles with bacon inside.... Wow. A tear came to my eyes... you had me at bacon. I thought that waffles couldn't be any better, but you took my fork away! If I was lucky enough to have the genetics of Brad Pitt or LL Cool J, I would eat these waffles everyday.Should you try Hash House a Go Go? YES! Unfortunately, I only have one stomach and I could not finish half of a dish by myself. If you are a picky eater, you may want to take your snobby as$ else where. If you are a huge breakfast fan, like me, give Hash a try. Bring a huge appetite and go early. Note to self, don't order the large Orange Juice next time, it was so large I did not finish it. Fresh OJ with out much water, it was like trying to drink a huge carton of concentrate. I will go for a tasty small next time. Stop staring at the pictures and go try it already!!!

Food fanatic, I made it a MUST for this trip to Sin City. Stopped by in the late morning, early afternoon and was able to get a seat right away, definitely made me happy because I expected a long wait, and the cherry on top was the cute little hostess that took us to our table, I don't remember her name, but I was madly in love (maybe foreshadowing the love I was soon to encounter with the food? possibly).The menu does not do the culinary artwork of their entrees any justice. When the waiter came around to deliver our food, I felt like I was in a Dr. Seuss book, or was having a \"bad acid\" trip (and by \"bad\", I mean good). The artistic expression that they display in their food is something that you don't see everyday, or at least in a meal in which the bill won't total over $300 for two people. The food here, is breakfast food, or \"twisted farm food\" as they call it, and believe me, it will live up to the name. You will find stuff on their menu that isn't available at just any breakfast joint, some of which includes snickers flapjacks/pancakes (yes, you read that right! Snickers pancakes!!!) and something called the \"O'hare of the Dog\" a 24oz. tall can of Budweiser in a brown paper bag!!!, with a side of bacon. I couldn't come to Hash House and not order the Man Vs. Food special, It was the fried chicken benedict. It came towered upon mashed potatoes, topped with a biscuit, fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, scrambled egg, and the chipotle sauce. And yes, it was as tasty and delicious as it sounds. One bite and the culmination of all the flavors will both blow your mind, as well as bewilder your taste buds, but in the best way possible. All the elements of the benedict are on point and good quality, the portions of their food are huge, it was ($14.95) for my benedict, and that could easily feed two people. As I watched the waiter frantically walk back and forth from table to table, I couldn't help but become hypnotized by the aroma and the visual creativity of the other dishes served here.

Frankly, it was preposterous. One of the guys interviewed said their biggest challenge was finding a way to make the supercar a stretch limo while maintaining the driving characteristics of a Ferrari. And somehow, they did it. \u00a0Although a bit less of an engineering challenge, the folks at Hash House A-Go-Go construct entrees that ride this fine line between quality and mega size.Featured on the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, Hash House specializes in their self-proclaimed \"twisted farm food,\" basically jumbo-sized offerings and off-beat interpretations of traditional American favorites. \u00a0While their \"twisted\" fare is available at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, they're probably best known for their breakfast. \u00a0We visited the day after Thanksgiving around 10:30a and had a predictably long wait (45-50 mins). Consistent with the rebel streak they're going for, walls at their Sahara Ave. location are adorned with diamond plate textured metal and large nuts and bolts. The industrial look suggests that guys into bikes and hot rods would feel right at home.We ordered their signature Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and Tractor Driver Special with Mango Coconut Pancakes (and for the record, it was my petite wife who chose to order the benedict). There's no denying the benedict was a monstrosity: a layer of biscuits, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, tomato, mozzarella, and spinach TOPPED with fried chicken and generous amounts of their chipotle cream (gravy). And because anything this big merits a tree-topper, they plant a long sprig of fresh sage right on top. \u00a0Good grief. \u00a0I have to say my initial impression was genuine awe with undertones of mild disgust. This was clearly a dream for anyone who derives regular enjoyment from KFC's \"famous bowls.\" Pushing past our bizarre feelings of hunger laced with nausea, Dorothy and I started picking at the gravy-laden structure. And to our surprise, there were some nice flavor combinations depending on where you chose to bury your fork. The fried chicken itself was done well--crispy with nice chunks of moist white meat. Combined with a bite of potato and gravy, the chicken evoked a holiday meal more than it did breakfast. The chipotle cream had a nice hint of smokiness, but as it cooled down, the self-hatred to taste ratio definitely increased. \u00a0Only lacking tomato sauce and the fact it wasn't tossed into the air at any point during its life cycle, my pancake was basically a medium to large-sized pizza. Once again, I was pleasantly surprised, particularly by the lack of any \"doughiness,\" or uncooked batter. The pancake itself wasn't the best I've had, but it was adequately fluffy and a solid effort, bolstered by generous chunks of fresh juicy mango and shredded coconut. Not bland, but not too sweet, some pieces of cake could be eaten without syrup. My eggs were soft scrambled just right, and the sausage links plump and tasty (I've found that a decent test of a cook's competency with eggs is to order them soft scrambled; not having them overcooked or gushing of yolk requires just a bit of care and timing). The Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade was a nice way to top things off--tasty and refreshing, but lacking any heavily-syruped sweetness. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It goes without saying that visits to these kinds of restaurants require a pre-meal regimen of a week-long fast, meditation, and a check-up with your doctor. \u00a0I think a regular visit would risk a gross-out burn-out. \u00a0Although, glancing at the scrambles and other egg dishes of our fellow patrons, it seems that slightly more modest meals are possible. \u00a0I've noticed a number of folks complaining about the price, which is perplexing. While the benedict cost $15.95 and the pancacke combo $14.95 (both at the top of their breakfast price scale), I'd point out that you're actually getting about $15.95 and $14.95 worth of food when ordering these dishes. \u00a0Each dish could easily feed two hungry human beings. \u00a0Sure, maybe they could drop a buck or so off the price, but if you're ever in L.A., go somewhere other than Denny's for breakfast. Double-digit fru-fru breakfasts are everywhere here, some with decent quality, but typically with a quarter of Hash House's portion size. \u00a0We have ample experience being ripped off at breakfast places, and Hash House isn't one of them. \u00a0 \u00a0A lunch at Hash House is probably in store for our next visit to Vegas. \u00a0I'll probably try the \"Kokomo,\" the benign moniker for what looks to be another guilt-ridden meal in the form of a meatloaf sandwich.

We were seated right away on a Friday night, but then sat for the next 20 minutes watching servers walk by when someone finally noticed us. I could tell the server knew we had been waiting a while when she noticed that we didn't even have water. She asked if we wanted to just order as no one had bothered to see if we wanted drinks. I ordered a coke and the chicken and waffles. After another 10 minutes we finally got our drinks. Another 5 minutes later they brought us biscuits which were big and looked good, but ended up being dry and kind of tasteless. They did bring the equivalent of about 1 pat of butter and a tiny bit of honey (imagine a McDonald's honey \"spread\" container). It just wasn't enough for four adults. Then after another pretty decent wait (our server came and reassured us twice that our food was coming up), the food came. I have to say that everyone's entree looked awesome. After we took photos, something I have never done at a restaurant, we dug in.....My first bite made me gag a little bit. Imagine as a kid experimenting with the food in the door of the refrigerator: maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic powder, green onion? No matter how you combine these things they are not going to mesh well on a waffle with bacon. Ok, I understand the spin on chicken and waffles, but when this is your signature dish and it tastes like shit-something is wrong. The waffles were inedible-thick and doughy. The bacon was limp. The chicken was cold and dry. I basically just picked at the deep fried green onions and spaghetti noodles and took the 1/4\" thick breading off of the chicken and had some protein. The other diners in our party didn't like their dish either; the pork cutlets. The bastards at HH even charged them $2.50 for splitting a meal that could have fed eight people. Needless to say, we didn't take any leftovers home.One last warning for good measure: if you are sensitive to MSG, don't order the waffles. The soy sauce in the dish contains MSG. I get a huge headache when I have even little bit and this must have had lots. I was totally disappointed with the whole experience.

We were seriously the only ones in there, maybe it's more of a breakfast place. We were greeted by the hostess who was very sweet and pleasant. She showed us to the table and made some recommendations since I had announced it was our first time there. I knew the portions were going to be huge so no appetizers for us. We looked at the menu briefly since we kinda knew from the website menu what we wanted. I ordered the chicken and bacon waffle tower, the wife had the chik pot pie. Both were huge. The potpie comes in what looks like a crust hat. The chikn waffles is built like a tower. The presentation was vey good, but the food in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. The fried chicken was somewhat dry, bland and greasy with a slight sage taste. The waffles on the other hnd were the best part... The bacon inside were crisp. I really didn't like the mound of fried leeks that everything was plated on. I think that's sort of what turned me off to the whole meal. I mean you have the sweet and savory combination of waffles, maple syrup and fried chicken, and then get hit with a bit of onion taste... Very off putting. The potpie was different than usual which is fine. I can't really comment on the taste but it was made with real nice chicken pieces and huge chopped veggies and potatoes. The wife liked it but stated not to expect the typical c.p.p. Bad news... The dessert. We had a Restaurant.com coupon to use so we needed to hit $50 on the tab. We ordered a snickers bread pudding. It comes out with ice cream on top which didn't taste like ice cream, but more like ice milk. It was not velvety smooth and silky but weird. I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be ice cream she said yes... Okay. Then we get into the bread pudding... It wasn't bread pudding at all. It was chocolate cake dipped in some egg wash maybe and I don't know...cooked somehow... I think it was microwaved because I hit a nice frozen section on the bottom. I asked the waitress if it was frozen, she said yes. She then looked at me blankly... I looked at her blankly. My wife said its okay we can't finish it anyways.I will, call me crazy give it another shot for breakfast, maybe try the Benedict. Again just to be clear...

Looking around you can see that their theme of \"twisted farm food\" runs consistent throughout the restaurant decor & its menu items. Our server was pretty slow and forgot about several things, granted she was new though. We ordered a couple Bloody Marys to start out with which were deliciously refreshing. They had the perfect blend of spiciness and tanginess and were garnished with a dill pickle, jalepe\u00f1o stuffed olive, lemon and a pickled green bean. If you prefer tequila over vodka opt for the Bloody Maria instead. As entr\u00e9s we got the HashHouse Meatloaf Pasta and the HashHouse Chicken & Waffles. Which are two of their most popular dishes. Oh yea don't forget to ask for some complimentary honey drizzled buttermilk biscuits! The Meatloaf Pasta was in a light pesto sauce with one slice of meatloaf on top and garnished with some sort of cheese basket looking thing. The Chicken and Waffles come with 4 waffles with a slice of bacon cooked right into each one stacked high up with two pieces of fried chicken. It is garnished with fried onion shreds, drizzled with syrup and conveniently has a knife stuck right into the middle of all of it. The waffles were too soft for my liking yet the chicken was nicely fried. But to be honest with you there was nothing too special about both of these dishes.. Because at the end of the day, it's simply just meatloaf, waffles & fried chicken.. So easy to make & hard to mess up. Yes, the portions are huge but the prices aren't cheap either.

After a bit the waitress finally brought out two flying saucers on a plate with a massive heap of lava flowing over it and a sage pine tree sticking out of the top with a sword (reminiscent of the Sword and the Stone). There were two huge succulent pieces of spiced fried chicken atop a mountain of scrambled egg, potatoes, Smokey bacon, fresh spinach, mozzarella, on a split biscuit all swimming in a pool of chipotle cream. \u00a0This is a meal for 4. It was soooooooooo delicious.

\u00a0Is this becoming a salad?! \u00a0The flavors together would've been better off in some God-forsaken breakfast sandwich but this was just too unwieldy. \u00a0Overall, I felt like less would've been more.Finally, the 3rd item ordered was the Kokomo, aka the meatloaf sandwich. \u00a0Whoever their baker is, they deserve a prize, because the milk bread that they grill for this sandwich is simply fantastic, just as good as their biscuits. \u00a0The meatloaf was well-seasoned and extremely satisfying with good quality beef. \u00a0The only problems were the overload of roasted tomatoes, which gave me immediate heartburn with a single whiff, and the side of mac and cheese that, contrary to what our nice waitress said, was the most pedestrian mac and cheese I have ever eaten (you're better off eating Kraft Easy Mac), unsalted and watery penne in a strange mish-mash of oddly flavored cheeses. \u00a0The best part of all of the meal (other than the biscuits and gravy) was that we housed 3 plates of food with people staring at us in awe/fear/shame, and I felt I channeled my inner Adam Richman to successfully defeat our challenge.For the prices, I'm not sure if any place in Vegas will give you as good a deal as the Hash House. \u00a0If you're a sane person, you could probably split a dish or order one and take the remnants home. \u00a0If you are looking for a gourmet breakfast, however, you may need to move on.", "Date": "2011-05-08", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "J M.", "ReviewID": "QqjpS-_6Jf8uwJKY2ZsFQw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "we were excited to go to hash hash a go go... watching it on man vs food as well as all the great reviews... when we got there it was not that crowded, which was good. we got seated and our server was really nice.she told us the corned beef hash was wonderful so i ordered that. \u00a0my baby ordered a standard breakfast.when our meal came out, it was such a HUGE portion.. it was really just way too much. \u00a0what a waste of food.. i know that's there niche, but this was a lil over the top. \u00a0i heard great things about there biscuits and the peach jam and i tried it, first of all it's a lil gross that the peach jam just sits on the table instead of having a new one placed each time. \u00a0secondly the biscuit was like a rock, i took one bite and spit it out.the hash sucked. \u00a0it was home made but really just a big pile of mess on a skillet. \u00a0i took 2 bites and i was over it. \u00a0i will tell you the saving grace from a 1 star, is the server took the meal off of our check without us even asking... she must have knew i didn't like it. since it was basically untouched.this is a way too hyped up restaurant.. after reading reviews i wish i tried the chicken and waffles, but i wouldn't go there again.", "Date": "2011-06-02", "Author_Location": "Henderson, NV"}, {"Author": "Patrick H.", "ReviewID": "UudMTFhhU65UNd6YrnJhhQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I hate to be a downer, but the breakfasts here were so big, they were more disgusting than appetizing.

Too bad because it was a belated Father's Day brunch for my dad. We still enjoyed it in good spirit, as nothing is direly bad - like fly in the food or we came down with food poisoning - none of that. \u00a0What we did though, me and my dad, for a good part of the time spent waiting for our orders was discussing how the decor of the restaurant missed the theme by a ten foot pole. My dad is a professional interior consultant for large scale resorts and casinos with experience more than my age. Anyway, that's probably only for the picky eyes. \u00a0I mean, the restaurant is clean, well lighted, good circulation and definitely meet the standard for an \"A\" restaurant. The Food: I will summarize it in 3 letters abbreviation: T.M.E {Too Much of Everything!!!!!}. \u00a0If it is to feed a farm worker who tills the field, rolls the hays, stacks pavements stones and whatever hard-manual-calorie-burning labors a farm worker does, then yes the portion is sufficient. But for a paper pusher, computer staring, sitting on your butt all day, going everywhere with cars folks for whom a distance between 1 parking space closer to the storefront is like a matter of life and death, the portion is a little bit much. I'm being sarcastic. Honestly, the portion is waaaaaaaay too much! Hello, people??? Is the coffee they served not thick enough to wake you up that you can see the mound of food in front of you?? Literally the food was stacked up and jabbed through with a big knife. Cool to see, cringe to think that the plate is for one person... ... I can only roll my eyes as people shovel at least half of the plates into their mouths. \u00a0Hey, I like to eat and indulge here and there. Regardless of my size. But this is off the chart.The taste: Double word: \"so-so\" \u00a0(is it considered one word?) Nothing special here, folks, Move along! To quote the description of the stars rating \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" And I have. Plenty times different other places. Does it taste bad? To be fair, not really. Was it excellent? I really won't go that far! My suggestion if you want to eat here:Treat this place like a family style dining, where you share the food. The more people you have in the party the better. For example: The specialty flapjacks can serve 4-6 easy. The hash can serve 2 if you don't order anything else, and 4 if you order the pancakes or waffles. We brought home the flapjack that morning, with the toasts, and we were full all the way until 7:30pm (that was a 10 hour filling breakfast!).

Every time when I visit, it's at least 45 minute wait. You can order from the bar area too if you don't want the wait. As you sit and wait for your order of food, nothing is more refreshing on a hot summer day is the kiwi watermelon lemonade. Just the look of the drink make you want to dive into it immediately. Easy to make recipe with such great combination. Bottom layer filled with 10 percent kiwi juice (POM carries their own kiwi juice), middle layer with 50 percent lemonade, and top layer with 50 percent watermelon juices (appears to be smash watermelon). Another tempting drink on their menu is the Bloody Mary, and it's not for the fainted heart or airline bloody Mary. For $8, you get a large glass of alcohol goodness.The Sage Chicken and waffles is number one choice for New York time with its reasons, it's layered with 4 bacon waffle. The waffle is perfectly made with its crisp on the outside and still piping hot in the middle with a few crunchy savory bites of bacon insides. These are not bacon bits; it's a large piece of crispy bacon that almost filed the whole waffle. Then we have 2 pieces of crispy chicken breast. From man vs. Food, they first seasoned the breast with garlic, sage, and some secret spice, and then soaked in an egg wash; they then breaded the chicken with corn flakes and flour, and then fry the chicken. My only disappointment is that the breast was a bit dried. But I'm never a fan of chicken breast, I want my dark meat. The chicken is the drizzle with some maple syrup which gives it's sweet and savory combination, and I am a lover for sweet and savory meal. The plate is garnish with a handful of fried leeks, which my husband love very much and hope to incorporates it in his dish someday. I also enjoy their little side dish of biscuit and gravy. This restaurant if definitely worth a return for me to try every dish on their menu. My next must try dish will be the stack fried green tomatoes. I will definitely give their original restaurant in San Diego a try. I've also tried the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict as mention on man vs. Food, but since the order was a take out, it wasn't memorable.

You can be unique with your recipes, you can be traditional... so LONG AS THE FOOD TASTES GOOD! I had the corned beef hash with eggs. The eggs were bland, under cooked, and horrible. The corned beef was shredded in long thick strips and seasoned with something that smelled like foot powder. The potatoes were the worst part of the breakfast. Hard, unseasoned, and cold.

Your food is either awesome or it sucks. I go to the casinos to gamble. I don't go to restaurants to gamble on taste. Sadly this is the reality of this place.Food:I had the Chicken Sage with waffles. All style, no substance. Chicken was dry and flavorless. Waffles was mushy. I rather get the 99cents Popeyes Tuesday special and slap it on a double Waffle Cafe waffle and it would taste much better and be cheaper. Crabcake, salmon, swordfish, burger seems to be satisfactory. Both my chicken and salmon had maple syrup on it. Maple syrup has a really strong taste, so it absolutely overshadows other food. I guess its suppose to help season the chicken. But maple syrup on salmon? WTF. Maple syrup on the side next time please. Another person in our group had swordfish which was good, but it was cold. He had to mix it with the mash potatoes to warm it up. This is supposed to be twisted farm food, not twisted sushi bar. Despite all of this, 2 people in our group seem to really enjoy the meal. Looks like the dice rolled in the favor.Service:This is probably unnecessary ripping, but since I'm on a roll anyways, might as well. Two things the waiter said stuck to me, we make everything \"home made\" so it'll take longer and because of this everything won't come out at once. Like really? I came to a restaurant to get \"home made\" dinner and expect it to take longer, otherwise I would have just went to my local Walmart and get a frozen dinner and blast it in the microwave and enjoy my meal in about 3 minutes. Secondly, just because it takes longer to make, does not excuse not timing the kitchen to get EVERYONE'S food out at the SAME time. It sucks being the last person waiting for food, watching everyone else eat. Food did come out separately as expected, but timing wasn't too bad. Maybe 1 or 2 minutes between each person. It's amazing they filled up everyone drinks in a timely manner, but couldn't get the 2 people in our group their placemats in a timely manner. Price:Food ranges around $10-$12 for your burgers, $15-$20 for their gluttony creation. $25+ for some other meats. Price seems to be about right for what you're SUPPOSE to be getting. Don't forget this place takes Restaurant.com GC for dinner, so bring a friend or two to help you, it's a lot of food after all.Summary: HashHouseAGo somewhere elseGo somewhere else", "Date": "2010-01-30", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "john b.", "ReviewID": "S0OGQNGI1IOQRPP9sDEBgg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Chicken and waffles.

Not because of it's sudden celebrity status, but because of the amazing menu that serves my favorite meal of the day- breakfast all day long...more like Breakfast, Brunch, and Brinner :-) I know there are 2 locations in Vegas. I was told the original building is small, dark, and not so glamorous, but honestly it's all about the food with me. Since I didn't have a car, the location on the strip at Imperial Palace, that I believe opened in January, was perfect! The casino itself was not very admirable, but Hash House upstairs was bright and clean. We went on a Sunday around noon, so I was afraid that we would have to wait a while, but I don't think we waited longer than 15 minutes. This place is not for the faint of heart, so let me start off by first saying that we were warned about the portions. Usually, I have no problems with that, but DAMN! There were four of us- the two, more experienced Hash House a Go-Goers were smart and shared the Man vs. Food favorite: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. My friend ordered the same thing, and I, of course, known to be a whore for chicken and waffles ordered Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles- NY Times favorite. Starting with the Benedict dish, it actually had a lot of my favorite things all thrown together on a plate, but in my opinion, it was a bit overwhelming with all the different flavors. The fried chicken was amazing, it had a nutty taste and texture that I enjoyed. My were waffles w/cooked bacon in between was a delightful surprise. My only gripe with that dish was they did not supply enough syrup! However, it was quite a sight to see a tower of waffles and chicken placed before me. Needless to say, none of us hardly finished. The couple with us nearly did and my friend and I each walked away stuffed with leftovers for the rest of the day!Service was decent for being extremely busy. I had to ask twice for extra syrup, but I'm not really into the whole making a scene or letting some insignificant thing ruin my meal, so whatever, I'm patient and can wait. The prices are excellent for the portions you receive, both a good and a bad thing. The mimosas were so-so, I've had better.

There is always a long list of ingredients in the description, and while you are promised what sounds like an orgy of chipotle cream, smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, basil pesto, and other tastebud stimulators that sound great on paper, what you get seems a little more like a pile of somewhat dry mashed potatoes, tasting more like the paper than what you imagined. There are dishes I enjoy- the sage fried chicken is consistently good, though the waffles are not crispy and deteriorate too fast, and, number one complaint, the huge portion is accompanied by a thimble-sized pitcher of syrup. What the hell? Same for those hubcap-sized pancakes(which come in various flavor combos but with very little flavor, and with insufficient syrup to wet them down, it's like trying to eat a blanket). And how about those giant biscuits they serve before dinner? I'm a fan, but they went from supplying one Barbie-sized pitcher of honey to the whole table, to skipping that entirely and just drizzling on a little (very little) before serving them. For a place that's so generous with the portions, and that must plow through a field of rosemary daily, garnishing even the plates that have nothing to do with said herb, why are they so reluctant to part with the condiments? Maybe they could save a couple of bucks by ditching their other inexplicable practice of adding what can only be described as french-fried broom straws to all their dishes. You spend the first few minutes just picking weeds from your plate. \u00a0The meatloaf is quite good, as is the grilled cheese, and Baby girl loves the salmon. The side vegetables are usually well cooked and seasoned. I've never tried dessert, because I can't fathom ever getting that far, and I've been tempted to try \u00a0one of those giant burgers, but never do because I know I can't finish it and re-heated burgers are just not good. Strangely, though, the leftovers we do bring home (which is always), seem to taste better than the original did. Who can explain it? But the HH brown bags are always seized upon by the family vultures with midnight munchies. Yes, I'll keep coming here to dine, but I will never again make the mistake of ordering the Thanksgiving dinner to go. The fried turkey was ok, the veggies were raw, the dressing was dry and flavored only with salt, the portions of potatoes were shockingly small- less than they serve on a single dinner in the restaurant, and the Snickers bread pudding dessert wound up in the trash. Unprecedented. Oh, and the number one reason I will keep coming back? You can almost always get your hands on a half off coupon.

Doesn't that sound like it's a mess, a jumble, a hodgepodge, or chop-chops, or a dance of unlimited jiggering? Nevertheless, it's beckoning that my Mom and I frequented this place twice. It's got ample parking. A wait in line to be seated. Not a large restaurant but it has a small bar and dining room with silver metal decor. Relaxed atmosphere. Service is attentive. A second visit was with Mom again with friends and some other friends on an occasion during a Happy Hour for my birthday celebration followed by dinner. Plenty of hors d'ouevres passed around. Mom loved the shrimp in a stick because they were large shrimps, they were Prawns! Well of course, I couldn't be any happier but just munching on the many finger foods which to my delight had just the right amount of tastiness. Afraid to fill myself up in so much of the appetizers I had to stop from sampling any more to make room for dinner since I have heard from friends was to make room in tummy-tum-tum for the main meals. I heeded, for when our dinner was set on the table, we couldn't help but admire the presentation and the generous portions. One meal can be shared by two or three people. Not disappointing at all was the taste. Breakfast favorites are: Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict with maple reduction served with 2 eggs, bacon, mashed potatoes & biscuit which the smell of sage gives it the extra invitation to deliciousness, and the Griddled French Toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup was just the right amount of moistness and sweetness. By the way, the bread is Amish bread, oh goood. Anything that's Southern cooking to me is a favorite and those two are my breakfast favorites. Wouldn't say no to Chocolate Chip Flapjack with banana and pecans which the chef specially made. He specifically made it and personally served it to us. The chef was personable. The flapjack were thick, soft and goooey with melting chocolate just like ooheey-goooey cheese in a pizza. I like their lemonade and the sweetened iced tea beverages. Dinner favorites: Andy's Stuffed Burger is roasted Mid-West beef patties topped with smoked mozzarella & charred tomato, stacked high in large buns served with criss-cross fries. The right amount of \"seaside\" taste in the Manila Clams drenched in white wine garlic broth mixed with caramelized onions and sprinkling of crushed red pepper. Say, yummy clams. Never to say no but say yes to Andy's Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower which was served with fried leeks drizzled with hot maple reduction. The waffles were just the right crispiness, and the chicken moist. The Black Skillet Pork Ribs served pipin' hot in a black skillet pipin' hot were in its rib-y juiciness to the bites. So they say it's \"twisted farm food\", twisted enough to twist my tasteful memory of it as country food super-sized! A feast to the eyes.

Their proportions are ginormous no matter what you order so if you come with a friend, plan to split the plate or you'll be walking around the casinos with a handful of doggy bags.I ordered the HH Original Benedict which was one of MANY styles of benedict they offered on their menu. The red pepper cream sauce was a sensational twist to a brunch time classic while underneath was a heavenly pile of country style biscuits, fresh spinach, tomato, and crispy bacon. They definitely did not skimp out on anything. The service was friendly and attentive and overall a great experience. And though I mainly rate restaurants based on service and quality of food, \u00a0if you are going for the environment, you will most certainly be puzzled. This place is definitely confused on whether it wants to be a diner or a mod/urban themed restaurant. The music was laughable, jumping from 80's synth pop to 90's rock ballads to early techno and somewhat distracting.I truly would have given this place 4 stars but there was one minor detail about the menu that left me a little bit disappointed... While they had an extensive brunch menu that was served through lunch, if you do not make it to sit down before they change their breakfast menu, all of their breakfast items are served with scrambled eggs only and the chefs WILL NOT cater to your preference of any other style eggs. That's right, if you are drooling over all those eggs benedict specialties, you will be served your biscuits with SCRAMBLED instead of poached how it's supposed to be.

With all the rave review we expected better, much better! Yes their portions are big but so are the prices. You can get better quality food at other brunch spots for cheaper.

They pump up the music so loud that the hostess had to yell at the top of her lungs for parties and if you're seated near her it's all you hear throughout your meal. It ridiculous! Turn the music down a little and people will be able to hear the host and have a nice conversation without yelling over the music!Food, hubby ordered his usual corned beef hash and let me tell u, don't order it if you're a corned beef hash lover! With the name hash house you'd expect their hash to be awesome. But it was just pieces of shredded fresh corned beef on top of seasoned potatoes, topped w/ shredded cheese & green onions. It's not even \"hashed\" together! They serve it with a lame dry biscuit and a piece of watermelon & strawberry. I ordered their popular menu item, banana French toast. Now this dish was good and had 3 big thick slices topped with cooked banana. This is the only reason they get 1star. So for both dishes & 2 drinks bill was $40 w/tip.

My feeling on this is If they made room to accommodate us then they probably should have known to give us a server or two that could manage it and have the other servers pick up additional tables. (I have worked in restaurants and this should be a no brainer) especially with the amount of staff that was present! She was so frazzled that when several of us had requested tortillas instead of muffins or toast and our breakfasts came out with rolls; we reminded her that we had requested tortillas she asked for all of our rolls back! Really?!?!?!? For What?!??! Is she gonna drop them off at another table????? Not that we wanted the rolls but really, you want it back?!?!?!? She did either rethink this or was told no because when she came back to the table she didn't want it anymore. THANK GOODNESS! Of course we have and will continue to go back.

If the answer is - not at all, do NOT eat here. While in Vegas I wanted to sample some non-strip fair and drunkenly asked a bouncer where he liked to go eat - he said Hash House A Go Go. Given that he was about 6'5\" and weighed 250 pounds, it all makes sense now. My girlfriends and I arrived around 11:00am on Sunday morning and were told it was about to be about a 40 minute wait. That wasn't too bad - the line seemed to be moving quickly and there were some benches outside where you can sit and take a look at the menu. We were called inside to eat and the overall ambiance is pretty neat. Like a tin shed that is crossed with a barn? I decided to really go for full sickness feeling and order the fried chicken benedict (with their famous sage fried chicken). I have to say that I don't eat fried chicken often - in fact it has probably been about 10 years since I last had some, but sometimes you have to make your stomach beg for mercy. The portion that I received could have easily fed me for 2 weeks and I am not a light eater. It probably weighed 20 pounds. It has fried chicken, mashed potatoes, eggs, bacon, hollandaise and who knows what else since you could not see the bottom of the plate. Despite the gargantuan portion, the taste was excellent. Truly just tasty, greasy, cheesy diner food that does not apologize for using 3 pounds of butter in each dish. The service was fast and the coffee was great! Really, what else can you really ask for from a diner? The only reason that I am not giving 5 stars is that the portions are really (embarrassingly if not annoyingly) large.

My husband and I went here to try something different from our normal breakfast/brunch haunts like The Coffee Cup in Boulder City or one of the champagne brunches at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay. With that said, the place was ok. There was a bit of a wait and for some reason the chef either really likes rosemary or his supplier gave him an excess that was unreasonable that he had to get rid of it somehow. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my husband ordered the meatloaf hash. For drinks I had the bloody mary and he had the orange juice since he had to go into work in a few hours. You can't really complain about orange juice and the bloody mary was just ok, the whole time I was drinking it I just kept thinking about the bloody mary I had at Rosemary's, which was AWESOME!, and I guess nothing could really compare to that so I can't really complain. As for the food, the meatloaf hash....well I think they got the order wrong because it actually looked like it was a sausage hash or something like that. My husband gave me a bite and I just couldn't believe that that bite contained anything that would resemble meatloaf. One it was pale, and it was somewhat rounded like it was a chicken sausage. He said that it was meatloaf but honestly, unless it was a chicken or turkey meatloaf I just couldn't understand why the \"meat\" was pale like that. As for my chicken and waffles, it was ok. Maybe i'm used to Roscoe's in LA, but the chicken was dry and the waffles was just too soft for me. The only saving grace was the fried leeks. The long piece of rosemary running through it was just ridiculous! With every bite all I smelled and tasted was the rosemary, I thought it was supposed to be \"sage\" fried chicken? Why not have fresh sage on the dish? The dish was bearable after my husband took that branch of rosemary off my dish and onto his side of the table. I felt bad cause he also had a branch of rosemary on his plate however it would have been considered a \"mini\" compared to the HUGE branch I got on my plate. New York Times Favorite or whatever they claim on their menu?!?...Either I got screwed on the chicken and the extra rosemary order the day before or maybe the New York Times critic was high when he/she decided to make it a favorite. Sorry I'm just not a fan of inedible garnishes that just don't make any sense on a plate. The ambiance and building itself was pretty cool, the staff was dressed as greasers, you could see their \"real\" hair under thier wigs. haha.

Wifes meal was bad and my daughters chicken breast was horrible. Again they must have just cook the chicken breast with no seasoning.

I'm sooo soooo sorry for you all...!Oh yeah, expect to have ZERO cellular signal in this part of the hotel...

The waitress said that their dishes were works of art and nothing could be removed or substituted. My brother in law wanted a biscuit, since we were outside of dinner, he was denied an order of biscuits, even after we offered to pay for them since it was his birthday. Overall, this experience made his birthday one we will always remember due to the unprofessional behavior of its servers, its inflexibility of its chef and the poor times of its menu window.

I mean people have said to me American portions are big; but I have never been over faced too much. Hash house blew the size competition out of the water. \u00a0What about the food? I hear you ask. Well my Sarah had the blue cheese salad with extra fried chicken on top and we both agreed that it was the best salad we both had ever tasted. \u00a0Yes the best combinations ever. The salad was heavenly. 10 out of 10. Now to my dish; the famous fried sage chicken with waffles and bacon. It was good but not the best because the saltiness of the bacon just doesn't gel with the sweet pancakes. Dont get me wrong but I still highly recommend it to anyone. The fried chicken itself was very good but not the best in the world. Service was friendly but felt like it was all about the tip.

It was a blast. The next morning, we were in need of some ono grindz for breakfast. I'd mentioned Hash House A Go Go to him plenty of times and said, \"We have to check it out and see what everyone is yelping about!\" \u00a0First, it is a long @$$ drive to this place from the strip if you're trying to avoid the traffic on the freeway. Anyways, there wasn't any parking because this place is so darn popular. So, I jumped out of the car and put our names in. The wait was going to be 20-40 minutes. I guess I was OK with that. It's not like I had anywhere else to be anytime soon. \u00a0We checked out the menu and noticed some platters NOT PLATES but PLATTERS walking across the room. Seeing the portions and taking in the wafted smells, we decided to stay. Even better, they had all kinds of fun specials. One of their specials for the weekend that we were there was their Captain Crunch French Toast. A table next to us ended up ordering that, it looked awesome. \u00a0Walter and I couldn't wait to be seated. There was so much to eat and not enough stomach space and no fridge in our hotel room. So, we were confined to our two dishes. We were very happy with our server, Cara. She was awesome. The kitchen made a mistake with my order, one that could have left me very sick, but she was sure to take care of it. One thing that I love and wish I could order and have it sent to me is their biscuit with fresh mango preserves on top. That sucker was to die for. I hadn't had a biscuit like that in forever. It was just so tasty. And yeah, you'd better be hungry to eat here. If you are only thinking of having a lil something to drink and to nibble on something small, this isn't the place for you. \u00a0Although, their fresh watermelon juice with kiwi syrup and all that is just too good to be true. I loved it. Walter and I gave each other the evil eye as one took a sip and the other waited for the cup to return to the table top. Why we didn't just order a 2nd one, we're not sure. Whatever. I think it made it that much more tasty. I loved it. The wait time wasn't bad. The parking stunk but that's a good thing when there's no parking and a line outside. \u00a0There was a YELP sticker outside the door and tons of happy people leaving. There were no crying children or obnoxiously loud and hung over/drunk dudes making scenes. This is a serious family establishment! \u00a0I really enjoyed my time here. The food was fresh and took a lil while to receive but that's because nothing is kept on a warmer back there. Everything is made fresh. I can respect that and the time that it takes to make all these dishes. It made it that much more tasty! \u00a0The potatoes are awesome. THey are lil crunchy and not real salty. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the pork chop that walter had was amazing!! It was pounded, breaded, fried and swimming in this crazy bbq cream sauce. That sauce was SOOOOOOOOO *drool* good! \u00a0I wish we could go back there again sometime sooner than February. Who knows. This place is for sure about size. I am so glad I came here. Now I know why so many YELP about this spot!", "Date": "2009-11-09", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Bob H.", "ReviewID": "UucSOddoi50ZcPLmunJgIg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Brenda's daughter took us here for breakfast one Saturday morning instead of going to the local Denny's or IHOP. She insisted that it had some good food and the overall reviews said it was pretty good. When we got there, there were quite a few people ahead of us so hopefully that spoke to the quality of the food--unfortunately it didn't. After a long wait in line we finally were seated and greeted by a waitress who didn't seem like she really wanted to be there either (she probably already tasted the food).We ordered our coffee and juice and stared at the menu. Brenda and I both have an adventurous palate and are willing to try anything at least once. However, there is a difference between adventurous and just plain crazy. When you read the menu, nothing jumps out and says \"Hey! Pick me! I'm really tasty.\" Quite the opposite--the food and flavor combinations of everything except the pancakes don't even begin to sound like they'll work together. However, to be polite, we placed our orders and waited for the food. I had the only thing that sounded somewhat normal to me; the corned beef has with red onions and Swiss cheese. By the way, they have a no substitutions policy and they do enforce it.The service here isn't any better than the food. Wait staff is slow and you may or may not have everyone's meal served at the same time.As we waited for the food to arrive, we saw that the portions they brought out were huge--even bigger than what we get at Black Bear. Unsurprisingly, with the amount of people here, the wait for the food was about 40 minutes, which is a bit long for breakfast. Apparently because the food is all \"homemade\", it prevents the kitchen staff from having any type of timing system to ensure everyone at the table is served at the same time. When my food was placed in front of me, I just kind of stared at it. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered corned beef hash. Instead of a neat presentation, I faced a huge pile of potatoes and the hash topped with a slice of cheese and two overcooked eggs. Sticking out of the top of this monstrosity was a rosemary tree. Normally, I would expect something like this to have the hash grilled and then have the cheese placed on top and remixed once it the cheese melted before putting it on the plate. I also expected the \"crispy\" potatoes to be on the side. Since they were thrown in with the hash, they were soggy from all the grease.The food itself lacked any real flavor and no amount of salt and pepper really did anything to improve it. Sure, the portions were huge, but that just meant more wasted food at the end of the meal. Quality is a bit more important that quantity.Their motto is \"Twisted Farm Food.\" I'm not sure what farms they're visiting, but it doesn't conjure up any memories of food I ate growing up in Pennsylvania Dutch country.

Or your friend who insists he is full after finishing what he ordered and then proceeds to pick everything off your plate plus eat all the remaining bread on the table? Put those two guys together and you get me.Did I mention the portions are astronomically huge? I ordered the \"appetizer\" beef tenderloin over crispy polenta and explicitly asked the waitress if it was especially large. She replied that it was \"appetizer size.\" Was it an appetizer for a giant?!? This thing was a full-on steak on a hearty slice-of-cake size piece of crispy polenta. And it was covered in cheese! I was so full! But dumbly, I had ordered a sandwich on top of that! The sandwich was a \"griddled\" cheese sandwich which was described as cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato and prosciutto. Each slice of bread was an inch thick! I ate a quarter of it and thought I was going to pass out. The extreme positive out of all this was that the food was actually good.

Simply amazing. All of the flavors worked really well together and the portion was more than enough for 2 adults (we could have actually shared the waffles with our 3 year old. We got him a kids lil tractor breakfast: One giant pancake, scrambled eggs, and a slice of bacon. He ate 1/2 of the pancake and the bacon. So the only thing that we didn't love was the price. They kind of gauge you on the drinks and the kids meal prices -- which aren't exactly comparable to \u00a0other restaurants. I totally understand, \"you get what you pay for,\" and don't get me wrong, the food was great. But a $40+ bill after tip for one adult meal, one kid meal, and 2 coffees is kind of a bit much. It cheapened the experience. Oh, and even though it doesn't state it on the menu, the waitress said there was a $3 split charge. She \u00a0tells us if we order something else that they can count it as a meal and waive the split -- I know, it didn't make sense to me either.

I mean, if you eat a whole plate by yourself you might just turn into a bad after school special and find yourself praying to the porcelain god kinda huge. Then you will start to feel ashamed for how much yummy you just indulged. So good you might as well just show up with a funnel to manage shoving the food into your face faster kinda good.
